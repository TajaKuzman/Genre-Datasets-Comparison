409	( 4 miles [ 7 km ] one way ) This walk follows part of the old railway line between Dufftown and Craigellachie , now a spur of the Speyside Way . Start from the car park at Craigellachie , following the signs for Dufftown . For much of its length , the old line follows the course of the river Fiddich , name to one of Scotland's most famous malt whiskies ( Glen Fiddich means Valley of the Deer ) . This walk lies in a wooded gorge cut by the peaty-brown river , and is peaceful throughout . Look out for red squirrels on the way . After crossing the river , the course of the walkway leaves the railway to cross farmland on the approach to Balvenie ( home to another whisky ) and then Dufftown itself . The walkway ends near the site of a former station , but it is worth continuing along the road for the double attraction of Balvenie Castle and Glenfiddich Distillery . Return to Craigellachie the same way , or by bus .	Instruction

Your individual situation is unique . The Breakthrough Process is designed to identify and maximize the specific strengths you will draw on to master your own unique challenges . These stories illustrate the dramatic growth some of our clients have experienced . Are you facing a major challenge ? Here are some examples of people who were ! A 48 year old former CEO of his own failed company was near despair . Struggling to pay off the $ 300 , 000 personal debt he incurred trying to save his company , he was working 60-80 hours a week . He believed he would need to follow this program for the rest of his life and hid his overwhelming feeling of failure from his associates . When he completed the process , he had a plan to pay off the debt in 4-5 years , while working more productively only 40-50 hours a week--and he was feeling successful again ! After seven years with a small growing company , the VP of sales and marketing was considering leaving her lucrative position . Another VP's harassment was making the workplace so unpleasant for her and others that she was experiencing impossible stress on the job . Although the president and CEO had been advised years earlier to remove this undercutting individual , they appeared to be afraid to confront him because of his attacking attitude . With her coaches help , she was able to provide enough support for both the president and the CEO , that they finally removed the offending executive . She reports that now "" It is like working for a different company . "" Back to Top Do you have a significant new opportunity ? Here 's someone who did . A website designer started his own consulting business when he suddenly lost his corporate job . He needed to make enough money to cover his living expenses immediately . Although he was skilled in technical issues , he lacked marketing skills , and did n't know how to structure his business or organize his own daily activities . His self-confidence was boosted when his coach helped him recognize many dormant entrepreneurial skills and re-awaken a lifelong commitment to following his own direction . His Coach helped him launch his business by defining and developing the specific skills , procedures and relationships he needed to secure and complete several large contracts . Back to Top Do you need to move to a higher level of performance ? These people did ! The young operations VP of a growing company was terrified that she would be unable to sustain her early outstanding job performance . She was certain that she had been overpromoted and would eventually be seen as a fraud . In the interviews , she recalled how she had transformed a near disastrous incident in high school by her understanding of the needs of the school principal , helping him create a plan that minimized embarrassment for everyone . She realized that her negotiation skills could help her succeed . She invited herself on a European trip to negotiate for other manufacturing facilities , and received a substantial raise . A physician was reprimanded for his treatment of nurses on the hospital staff , and was also asked to leave a group practice . His goal was to dramatically improve his relationships with all hospital personnel at a new hospital . After a few months he was told that his conduct was professional and exemplary , and that he was exceptionally easy to work with . Back to Top Do you know what you need to do , yet consistently resist doing it ? Learn to break through resistance ! A Realtor's aspirations to lead spiritual workshops caused her to try to please everybody , lose track of her priorities , and accumulate considerable debt . Examining her current financial reality , and comparing it to her life goals , helped her decide that she could only accomplish her dream by first increasing her net worth -- through selling real estate . She reestablished her professional contacts , partnering with a very successful agent who helped her stay on track and keep her work current . She set and started meeting financial goals to double her annual productivity . Limiting her work time to certain hours allowed her to continue making her spiritual contributions . An executive who had been wavering about whether to leave a deteriorating relationship for at least two years decided to use all of her ( considerable ) skills to either transform the relationship or end it . She stopped using her unfounded belief in her financial vulnerability as an excuse to stay in the relationship , and told her partner she was ready to leave if things did n't change . She reports that their conversations are now deeper and more honest than ever before . Back to Top Are you a key player with significant gaps holding you back ? Close the gaps and get where you want to go ! The professional staff of an agency confronted their director because he was not responding to their concerns . He knew he was avoiding listening to their problems because he was powerless to provide them with the resources they needed to accomplish their goals . He learned to actively listen to his staff . He was pleasantly surprised that they responded to his attention by suggesting ways in which they could all work together to make the agency more effective . A CPA with 10 years experience in a national firm was told that he would not be promoted to partner until he improved his relationships with everyone in the firm . After he worked with us for four months , the managing partner in his office said , "" he softened his confrontational style , learned to better support the growth of people he supervised , and learned to set appropriate limits with clients , staff members and within himself ; he became a much better manager . "" He was recommended for promotion . Back to Top A n u n e x p e c t e d r e s u l t : A health professional was struggling to grow his practice , trying one marketing scheme after another , with minimal results . After a period of intensive reflection and review of his strengths and values , he recognized that he really was n't very enthusiastic about developing a practice after all . Realizing that he had always been good at explaining complex things to people , he closed his practice and took a good job in technical sales , dramatically increasing both his income and his job satisfaction .

50	"CHAPTER II . The Pool of Tears ' Curiouser and curiouser ! ' cried Alice ( she was so much surprised , that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English ) ; ' now I 'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was ! Good-bye , feet ! ' ( for when she looked down at her feet , they seemed to be almost out of sight , they were getting so far off ) . ' Oh , my poor little feet , I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ? I 'm sure _I_ sha n ' t be able ! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you : you must manage the best way you can ; -- but I must be kind to them , ' thought Alice , ' or perhaps they wo n ' t walk the way I want to go ! Let me see : I 'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas . ' And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it . ' They must go by the carrier , ' she thought ; ' and how funny it 'll seem , sending presents to one's own feet ! And how odd the directions will look ! ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT , ESQ. HEARTHRUG , NEAR THE FENDER , ( WITH ALICE'S LOVE ) . Oh dear , what nonsense I 'm talking ! ' Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall : in fact she was now more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door . Poor Alice ! It was as much as she could do , lying down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye ; but to get through was more hopeless than ever : she sat down and began to cry again . ' You ought to be ashamed of yourself , ' said Alice , ' a great girl like you , ' ( she might well say this ) , ' to go on crying in this way ! Stop this moment , I tell you ! ' But she went on all the same , shedding gallons of tears , until there was a large pool all round her , about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall . After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming . It was the White Rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ' Oh ! the Duchess , the Duchess ! Oh ! wo n ' t she be savage if I 've kept her waiting ! ' Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the Rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , ' If you please , sir -- ' The Rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go . Alice took up the fan and gloves , and , as the hall was very hot , she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking : ' Dear , dear ! How queer everything is to-day ! And yesterday things went on just as usual . I wonder if I 've been changed in the night ? Let me think : was I the same when I got up this morning ? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different . But if I 'm not the same , the next question is , Who in the world am I ? Ah , THAT 'S the great puzzle ! ' And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself , to see if she could have been changed for any of them . ' I 'm sure I 'm not Ada , ' she said , ' for her hair goes in such long ringlets , and mine does n ' t go in ringlets at all ; and I 'm sure I ca n ' t be Mabel , for I know all sorts of things , and she , oh ! she knows such a very little ! Besides , SHE'S she , and I 'm I , and--oh dear , how puzzling it all is ! I 'll try if I know all the things I used to know . Let me see : four times five is twelve , and four times six is thirteen , and four times seven is--oh dear ! I shall never get to twenty at that rate ! However , the Multiplication Table does n ' t signify : let 's try Geography . London is the capital of Paris , and Paris is the capital of Rome , and Rome--no , THAT 'S all wrong , I 'm certain ! I must have been changed for Mabel ! I 'll try and say "" How doth the little -- "" ' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons , and began to repeat it , but her voice sounded hoarse and strange , and the words did not come the same as they used to do : -- ' How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail , And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale ! ' How cheerfully he seems to grin , How neatly spread his claws , And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws ! ' ' I 'm sure those are not the right words , ' said poor Alice , and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on , ' I must be Mabel after all , and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house , and have next to no toys to play with , and oh ! ever so many lessons to learn ! No , I 've made up my mind about it ; if I 'm Mabel , I 'll stay down here ! It 'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying "" Come up again , dear ! "" I shall only look up and say "" Who am I then ? Tell me that first , and then , if I like being that person , I 'll come up : if not , I 'll stay down here till I 'm somebody else "" -- but , oh dear ! ' cried Alice , with a sudden burst of tears , ' I do wish they WOULD put their heads down ! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here ! ' As she said this she looked down at her hands , and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking . ' How CAN I have done that ? ' she thought . ' I must be growing small again . ' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding , and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether . ' That WAS a narrow escape ! ' said Alice , a good deal frightened at the sudden change , but very glad to find herself still in existence ; ' and now for the garden ! ' and she ran with all speed back to the little door : but , alas ! the little door was shut again , and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before , ' and things are worse than ever , ' thought the poor child , ' for I never was so small as this before , never ! And I declare it 's too bad , that it is ! ' As she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash ! she was up to her chin in salt water . Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , ' and in that case I can go back by railway , ' she said to herself . ( Alice had been to the seaside once in her life , and had come to the general conclusion , that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea , some children digging in the sand with wooden spades , then a row of lodging houses , and behind them a railway station . ) However , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high . ' I wish I had n ' t cried so much ! ' said Alice , as she swam about , trying to find her way out . ' I shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by being drowned in my own tears ! That WILL be a queer thing , to be sure ! However , everything is queer to-day . ' Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself . ' Would it be of any use , now , ' thought Alice , ' to speak to this mouse ? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here , that I should think very likely it can talk : at any rate , there 's no harm in trying . ' So she began : ' O Mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ? I am very tired of swimming about here , O Mouse ! ' ( Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she had never done such a thing before , but she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar , ' A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse ! ' ) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively , and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes , but it said nothing . ' Perhaps it does n ' t understand English , ' thought Alice ; ' I daresay it 's a French mouse , come over with William the Conqueror . ' ( For , with all her knowledge of history , Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened . ) So she began again : ' Ou est ma chatte ? ' which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book . The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright . ' Oh , I beg your pardon ! ' cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings . ' I quite forgot you did n't like cats . ' ' Not like cats ! ' cried the Mouse , in a shrill , passionate voice . ' Would YOU like cats if you were me ? ' ' Well , perhaps not , ' said Alice in a soothing tone : ' do n't be angry about it . And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah : I think you 'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her . She is such a dear quiet thing , ' Alice went on , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the pool , ' and she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she 's such a capital one for catching mice--oh , I beg your pardon ! ' cried Alice again , for this time the Mouse was bristling all over , and she felt certain it must be really offended . ' We wo n ' t talk about her any more if you 'd rather not . ' ' We indeed ! ' cried the Mouse , who was trembling down to the end of his tail . ' As if I would talk on such a subject ! Our family always HATED cats : nasty , low , vulgar things ! Do n't let me hear the name again ! ' ' I wo n ' t indeed ! ' said Alice , in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation . ' Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs ? ' The Mouse did not answer , so Alice went on eagerly : ' There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you ! A little bright-eyed terrier , you know , with oh , such long curly brown hair ! And it 'll fetch things when you throw them , and it 'll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of things--I ca n ' t remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says it 's so useful , it 's worth a hundred pounds ! He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear ! ' cried Alice in a sorrowful tone , ' I 'm afraid I 've offended it again ! ' For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go , and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went . So she called softly after it , ' Mouse dear ! Do come back again , and we wo n ' t talk about cats or dogs either , if you do n't like them ! ' When the Mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale ( with passion , Alice thought ) , and it said in a low trembling voice , ' Let us get to the shore , and then I 'll tell you my history , and you 'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs . ' It was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a Duck and a Dodo , a Lory and an Eaglet , and several other curious creatures . Alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore ."	Prose/Lyrical
1438	"Introduction This paper is written from the perspective of a long-serving expatriate classroom practitioner working in the Arab Gulf , and is based on a presentation given at the 2013 Fourth Annual Gulf Comparative Education Symposium . It offers a critical examination of Kennedy's ( 2001 ) model of Language Policy and Planning , explaining how that model operates within the Arab Gulf educational context , but simultaneously questioning Kennedy's relegation of teachers to the category of "" variables "" . The paper argues that teachers ought to be regarded as far more than delivery agents who are tasked with passing on a set curriculum to a homogenous student population , and guaranteeing results that will satisfy the demands of external stakeholders . It suggests that truly dedicated teachers share specific inspirational qualities , and have also adopted recognizable "" best practices "" that make then central to the entire educational process . Key Words Context domain learner planning policy stakeholder variable . Preamble This paper is entitled Worm's - Eye View â and I am the worm . I am a serving classroom teacher , or classroom practitioner if you want to use a fancier euphemism . I began teaching in 1972 , and in the last 40 years , one thing that has remained unchanged is the contempt that many employers , managers and stakeholders demonstrate when dealing with classroom practitioners . McCourt ( 2005 ; 157 ) explains : - "" This is the situation in the public schools in America . The further you travel from the classroom the greater your financial and professional rewards . Get the license , teach for two or three years . Take courses in administration , supervision , guidance , and with your new certificates you can move to an office with air-conditioning , private toilets , long lunches , secretaries . You wo n't have to struggle with large groups of pain-in-the-arse kids . Hide out in your office and you wo n't even have to see the little buggers . "" This aspect of education policy , therefore , probably has global application . Paradoxically , lesser rewards are offered to those teachers who fulfill their job descriptions and actually TEACH . Dornyei ( 2001 ; 169 ) suggests that this situation can be rectified by "" introducing titles such as ' super-teachers ' or ' master-teachers ' within the educational hierarchy "" but that is questionable . The award of titles like "" Teacher of the Year "" apart from engendering jealousy and divisions within staffrooms , also offer hostages to fortune . There is , for example , the case of Sandra Hadsock , who taught at the Central High School in Hernando Country , Florida . In 2010 she was their Teacher of the Year . Do a Youtube search for Sandra Hadsock and you find a video of her punching a student in the face . She actually does it twice . This inevitably raises doubts , not only about the validity of her award but also , possibly unfairly , about the other candidates for that same title . In the 1970s , British Further Education was encumbered with an almost Byzantine hierarchy of titles . The intention was to offer a clear career path . In reality , it encouraged ambitious teachers to plan their next career move almost as soon as they arrived in post , creating a level of disruption that a simpler arrangement might have avoided ."

Cancer is abnormal cell growth , which is the result of damage - mutation - to certain crucial genes , the cell's instructions for making the proteins it needs to survive , grow and multiply . Many factors can affect the chances of the gene damage that may eventually lead to cancer , including cigarette smoke and other chemicals , a poor diet , ultraviolet radiation that causes sunburn , as well as some infections . Chemicals that cause cancer are called carcinogens . All these things can increase your risk of cancer .

793	Nature of problem : The analytical calculations using vector calculus that appear in plasma physics , fluid dynamics , and other fields sometimes can become extremely complex . The complexity usually originates from both the vector operations themselves and the underlying coordinate systems . Solution method : To implement automatic symbolic vector analysis in general coordinate systems , we need a simple and systematic mathematical framework . The modern viewpoint of 3D vector calculus , differential forms on 3-manifolds , is utilized for this purpose . On the other hand , a well - developed high level programming language with a symbolic computation capability is also necessary . To the end , we chose Mathematica by Wolfram Research Inc. Unusual features : Asymptotic capabilities , 2D vector analysis notation , and a simple interface for users to define their own coordinate systems . Running time : Running time is problem and machine dependent . Running Mathematica 3.0 on a Pentium II 150 MHz PC with 48M memory , is takes about 2 second CPU time to carry out a single vector differential operation to the second order of the inverse aspect ratio in the large aspect ratio circular concentric tokamak coordinate system .

656	The first five years of my life were spent on a farm in Surrey . As far as I can remember , it was idyllic . And then my father died and my mother had a sort of breakdown , so my travels began ; I ca n't recall all the people and all the places I was sent to , but wherever I was I would raid the bookcase and read - anything and everything . At six I went to boarding school where I decided I would become a concert pianist . I thought you had to be man to write books , probably because of Rudyard Kipling , R L Stevenson , Charles Dickens and Co. I had n't met Jane Austen or the Brontes . For two years I was frightened of everything and everyone , and then I became bad . When I was sixteen I decided to run away , this took the form of joining a repertory company instead of taking my A-levels . It was heaven . At twenty-one I went to London to seek my fame and fortune on the West-end stage . Nothing happened . So I became a Governess in Italy . The boys I was supposed to be teaching were bigger than I was , they educated me instead . When I returned to Britain I joined the BBC as a photographic researcher , then worked my way up to Floor Manager in the News Department and finally a Director / Editor for children's television . My producer told me I should write my own books but I did n't think I was good enough . One day I met a Welsh painter , whom I eventually married . My husband inherited an old watermill in Powys , so we came to Wales and had three children who are all bilingual . They taught me to write real stories for children , and then they grew up and went to Rome , Edinburgh and the World . But they still help me to write my books . AuthorZone 2 - September 2000 .

160	"My name is Joseph , a Member of Parliament in Kenya . And picture a Masai village . And one evening , government soldiers come , surround the village , and ask each elder to bring one boy to school . That 's how I went to school -- pretty much a government guy pointing a gun , and told my father , "" You have to make a choice . "" So I walked very comfortably to this missionary school , that was run by an American missionary , and the first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy . I had never in my life ever tasted candy . So I said to myself , with all these hundred other boys , this is where I belong . Stayed -- ( Laughter ) -- when everybody else was dropping out . My family moved . We 're nomads . Every time school closed -- it was a boarding school , and I was seven -- you had to travel until you find them . 50 miles , 40 miles , it does n ' t matter . You slept in the bush , but you kept going . And I stayed . I do n't know why I stayed , but I stayed . And all of a sudden , I passed the national examination , found myself in a very beautiful high school in Kenya . And I finished high school . And just walking , and found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the United States . My mother still lives in a cow-dung hut , none of my brothers are going to school and this man told me , "" Here , go . "" So I got a scholarship to St. Lawrence University , upstate New York . Finished that , and then after that I went to Harvard Graduate School . Finished that , and then I worked in DC a little bit . I wrote a book for National Geographic , and taught history , US history . And every time I kept going back home , listening to the problems of these people , sick people , people with no water , all the stuff . And every time I go back to America , I kept thinking about them . Then one day , an elder gave me a story , and this story went like this . Long time ago , there was a big war between tribes . And there was this specific tribe that was really afraid of this other Luhya tribe . And every time , they sent scouts out there to make sure no one attacked them . So one day , the scouts came running , and told the villagers , "" The enemies are coming , only half an hour away -- they 'll be here . "" So people scrambled , took their things and ready to go , move out . But there were two men , one man was blind , one man had no legs -- he was born like that . The leader of the chiefs said , "" No , sorry , we ca n ' t take you , you 'll slow us down . We have to flee our women and children , we have to run . "" And they were left behind , waiting to die . But these two people worked something out . The blind man said , "" Look , I 'm a very strong man , but I ca n ' t see . "" The man with no legs says , "" I can see as far as the end of the world , but I ca n ' t save myself from a cat , or whatever , animals . "" So the blind man went down on his knees , down like this , and told the man with no legs to go over his back , and stood up . The man on top can see , the blind man can walk . And these guys took off , followed the footsteps of the villagers , until they found and passed them . So this was told to me in a set-up of elders . And it 's a really poor area , I represent Northern Kenya -- most nomadic , remote areas you can even find . And that man told me , "" So , here you are , you 've got a good education from America , you have a good life in America , what are you going to do for us ? We want you to be our eyes , we 'll give you the legs . We 'll walk you , you lead us . "" So the opportunity came , and I was always thinking about that , what can I do to help my people ? Every time you go to an area where for 43 years of independence , we still do n't have basic health facilities . A man has to be transported in a wheelbarrow to 20 , 30 kilometers for hospital . No clean drinking water . So I said , "" I 'm going to dedicate myself , I 'm leaving America . I 'm going to run for office . "" So last July -- I moved from America in June , ran in July election and won . And I came for them , and that 's my goal . And right now , I have in place for the last nine months a plan that in five years , every nomad will have clean drinking water . We 're building dispensaries across that constituency . I 'm asking my friends from America to help with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out . I 'm trying to improve infrastructure . I 'm using the knowledge I received from the United States and from my community to move them forward . I 'm trying to develop homegrown solutions to our issues . Because we know , we realize that people outside can come and help us , but if we do n't help ourselves , there 's nothing we can do . So my plan right now , as I continue with introducing students to different fields -- some become doctors , some lawyers -- we want to produce a comprehensive group of people , students , who can come back and help us see a community grow that is in the middle of a huge economic recession . So as I continue to be a Member of Parliament , and as I continue listening to all of you talking about botany , talking about health , talking about democracy , talking about new inventions , I 'm hoping that one day , in my own little community -- which is 26,000 square kilometers , maybe five times the size of Rhode Island , with no roads -- we 'll be able to become a model to help others develop . Thank you very much . </content"	Opinion/Argumentation

1305	"Freelancer's FAQ RED FLAGS FOR FREELANCERS RED FLAGS FOR FREELANCERS Clients â they 're our source of assignments , but sometimes of roadblocks as well . In a nationally attended teleconference led by Margaret L. Moser , participants in the Editorial Freelancers Association's ( EFA ) New Freelancers ( NFL ) affinity group from as far afield as Florida , California , and Alaska learned about red flags warning them of such roadblocks and how to respond to them from Laurie Lewis , former EFA co-exec , former co-leader of the NFL affinity group and author of What to Charge : Pricing Strategies for Freelancers and Consultants . Although clients have a vested interest in their projects , Lewis cautioned they also may have little understanding of the services provided by editors . Omens of "" trouble down the road "" are often revealed as verbal red flags . Lewis provided a list of these warning signs . 1 . Client says , "" We do n't pay a lot , but we can offer steady work . "" This red flag may be a particular hazard for new freelancers . Positive and negative aspects of this situation include the following , If you 're looking for "" steady work "" and want to commit to , say , 10 hours a week , this kind of arrangement could be beneficial . Accepting a low rate means this client will expect to continue paying that fee . Doing most of your work for a low-paying client leaves you no time to search for more lucrative assignments . 2 . Client says , "" We need you in-house 40 hours a week . "" This stipulation turns an assignment into contract work ( "" permalance "" ) and raises several concerns : If the assignment's short , say two to six weeks , it may be okay . The assignment leaves no time to prospect for other clients or projects , and limits the variety of material on which you 're working . Working exclusively at the client's premises may affect your freelance status with the IRS . To resolve this , propose working parameters , such as working the first two weeks at the client's office , then completing the project from home . Suggest a split schedule â working two days per week at the client's location and three days from home . 3 . Client says , "" It 's in pretty good shape . "" This trap catches new and experienced freelancers . Clients virtually always think this about their documents â and have little concept of the work that editors perform . 4 . Client says , "" It should n't take long . "" This could mean a short turnaround , or you may be immersed in the editorial equivalent of "" Waiting for Godot . "" Lewis advised freelancers to ask clients about their expectations regarding the projected number of hours or the amount of work to be accomplished in an hour . If they have budgeted 20 hours for a project that reasonably could take longer , you may end up in a financial bind . 5 . Client says , "" I have n't seen it yet , but it 's in pretty good shape , "" and might add , "" You can just do a fast edit . "" In this case , either run for the hills or review red flags 3 and 4 . 6 . Client says , "" We should have the manuscript ready for you in two days and we need it back by the end of the week . "" The client is tying a rather loose availability date for the material to a definite delivery date . Lock this client down with an agreement that , if the material is not ready for you when anticipated , your delivery date will be adjusted by the same amount of time . 7 . Client says , "" I need this proofread . "" Many clients do n't understand the difference between proofreading and the various levels of editing . In most cases , these individuals actually need a copyeditor . In some instances , clients may be trying to obtain a "" cheap edit "" by calling it proofreading . 8 . Client says , "" We 've had another freelancer work on this , and s / he was n't very good . "" Although the previous freelancer may have been unskilled , this raises concerns about the client's abilities and expectations , such as : The client may expect you to turn garbage into gold . The client may not respect freelancers . The client may be so invested in the material that s / he takes editorial changes as a personal affront . Beware the client who tells you , "" My secretary and my wife read it , and they think it 's wonderful . "" Again , break down the assignment with the client to get a clear list of expectations . If this ca n't be done , it may be prudent to walk away . 9 . Client says , "" I inherited this job . "" Lewis said this red flag is common in a time of downsizing . The warnings it raises include : The client does n't care about the project , wo n't assume ownership , and wo n't be diligent about follow-through or with processing your invoices . 10 . The issue is n't a client's words â rather , it 's the lack of words . If clients dither , are inarticulate or are unresponsive , your progress will be stymied . If you ca n't get them to talk to you at the beginning of the project , you wo n't get the details or feedback needed later . When clients do n't express clear expectations : If the client does n't like the work you turn in , s / he 'll blame you for a bad job . The individual ( s ) with whom you 're dealing may not be the ultimate client â and may be getting unclear instructions from above . 11 . Insufficient client data . Reputable clients should have no objections to providing names of an individual contact and organization , along with an address , e-mail , phone number , and fax number . 12 . Documenting the assignment . Some clients seem taken aback when you request a contract or letter of agreement . However , you should get a formal contract , a letter of agreement or at least an e-mail detailing the assignment before starting work . If the client does n't provide this , send an e-mail laying out the project as you understand it , including an overall description of the work to be done , the work stages , fees and dates ( including turnaround for client feedback and timing of payment ) . Mention the need for renegotiation if the schedule changes . Request a client response by saying , "" Please get back to me by MM / DD with confirmation or any questions . If I do n't hear back from you via e-mail by this date , I will understand your confirmation of the above terms . "" You might also leave a space for the client's signature and request a fax of the signed document . Attended by both "" newbies "" and seasoned freelancers , the session illustrated that these cautionary red flags are common to clients all over the country . As Lewis pointed out , we editors often must morph into educators â to help clients and ourselves understand exactly what is needed on any given project .

169	"Today I 'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds . And the problem I 'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy , which is , "" How can we know whether other people have minds ? "" That is , maybe you have a mind , and everyone else is just a really convincing robot . So that 's a problem in philosophy . But for today's purposes I 'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind , and that I do n't have to worry about this . There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses , and novelists . Which is , "" Why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes ? "" Or perhaps , more relevantly , "" Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes ? "" I think novelists put this best . Like Philip Roth , who said , "" And yet , what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people ? So ill equipped are we all , to envision one another 's interior workings and invisible aims . "" So as a teacher , and as a spouse , this is , of course , a problem I confront every day . But as a scientist , I 'm interested in a different problem of other minds , and that is the one I 'm going to introduce to you today . And that problem is , "" How is it so easy to know other minds ? "" So to start with an illustration , you need almost no information , one snapshot of a stranger , to guess what this woman is thinking , or what this man is . And put another way , the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds , our brain , is made up of pieces , brain cells , that we share with all other animals , with monkeys , and mice , and even sea slugs . And yet , you put them together in a particular network , and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet . Or to say , as Alan Greenspan did , "" I know you think you understand what you thought I said , but I 'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant . "" ( Laughter ) So the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas , one in each hand . And to try to understand how you can put together simple units , simple messages over space and time , in a network , and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds . So I 'm going to tell you three things about this today . Obviously the whole project here is huge . And I 'm going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about other people's thoughts . Some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job . And then finally , to show that some of the differences between people , in how we judge others , can be explained by differences in this brain system . So first , the first thing I want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain , in your brains , whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts . This is a picture of it . It 's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction . It 's above and behind your right ear . And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you , or when you read Romeo and Juliet , or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan . And you do n't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems . So this brain region is called the RTPJ . And this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults . They 're MIT undergraduates . ( Laughter ) The second thing I want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other minds , we were n ' t always that way . It takes children a long time to break into the system . I 'm going to show you a little bit of that long , extended process . The first thing I 'm going to show you is a change between age three and five , as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own . So I 'm going to show you a five-year-old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task . Video : This is the first pirate . His name is Ivan . And you know what pirates really like ? Pirates really like cheese sandwiches . Child : Cheese ? I love cheese ! R. S. : Yeah . So Ivan has this cheese sandwich . and he says "" Yum yum yum yum yum ! I really love cheese sandwiches . "" And Ivan puts his sandwich over here , on top of the pirate chest . And Ivan says , "" You know what ? I need a drink with my lunch . "" And so Ivan goes to get a drink . And while Ivan is away the wind comes , and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass . And now , here comes the other pirate . This pirate is called Joshua . And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches . So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says , "" Yum yum yum yum yum ! I love cheese sandwiches . "" And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest . Child : So , that one is his . R. S. : That one is Joshua's . That 's right . Child : And then his went on the ground . R. S. : That 's exactly right . Child : So he wo n ' t know which one is his . R. S. : Oh . So now Joshua goes off to get a drink . Ivan comes back and he says , "" I want my cheese sandwich . "" So which one do you think Ivan is going to take ? Child : I think he is going to take that one . R. S. : Yeah , you think he 's going to take that one ? Alright . Let 's see . Oh yeah , you were right . He took that one . So that 's a five-year-old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions . Now I 'm going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle . Video : R. S. : And Ivan says , "" I want my cheese sandwich . "" Which sandwich is he going to take ? Do you think he 's going to take that one ? Let 's see what happens . Let 's see what he does . Here comes Ivan . And he says , "" I want my cheese sandwich . "" And he takes this one . Uh-oh . Why did he take that one ? Child : His was on the grass . R. S. So the three-year-old does two things differently . First he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich that 's really his . And second , when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his , where we would say he 's taking that one because he thinks it 's his , the three-year-old comes up with another explanation . He 's not taking his own sandwich because he does n ' t want it , because now it 's dirty , on the ground . So that 's why he 's taking the other sandwich . Now of course , development does n ' t end at five . And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now , not for an action prediction , but for a moral judgement . So first I 'm going to show you the three-year-old again . Video : R. S. : So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich ? Child : Yeah . R. S. : Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich ? Child : Yeah . R. S. : So it 's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan to take Joshua's sandwich . Since he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich . But now I 'm going to show you the five-year-old . Remember the five-year-old completely understood why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich . Video : R. S. : Was Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich ? Child : Um , yeah . R. S. : And so , it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response . Video : R. S. : Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich ? Child : No , because the wind should get in trouble . R. S. He says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches . ( Laughter ) And now what we 've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what 's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts . So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region , the RTPJ , being used while children are thinking about other people . But it 's not quite like the adult brain . So where as in the adults , as I told you , this brain region is almost completely specialized . It does almost nothing else , except for thinking about other people's thoughts . In children it 's much less so , when they are age five to eight , the age range of the children I just showed you . And actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds , getting into early adolescence , they still do n't have quite an adult-like brain region . And so , what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence , both the cognitive system , our mind's ability to think about other minds , and the brain system that supports it , are continuing , slowly , to develop . But of course , as you 're probably aware , even in adulthood , people differ from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds , how often they do it , and how accurately . And so what we wanted to know was , could differences among adults , in how they think about other people's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region . So the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids . And I 'm going to give that to you now . So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory and they take a break for coffee . And Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee . Grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder , which is sugar . But the powder is labeled "" Deadly Poison "" . So Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison . And she puts it in her friend's coffee . And her friend drinks the coffee , and is fine . How many people think it was morally permissible for Grace to put the powder in the coffee ? Okay . Good . ( Laughter ) So we ask people how much should Grace be blamed in this case , which we call a failed attempt to harm . And we can compare that to another case where everything in the real world is the same . The powder is still sugar , but what 's different is what Grace thinks . Now she thinks the powder is sugar . And perhaps unsurprisingly , if Grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend's coffee , people say she deserves no blame at all . Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison , even though it 's really sugar , now people say she deserves a lot of blame , even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same . And in fact they say she deserves more blame in this case , the failed attempt to harm , than in another case , which we call an accident . Where Grace thought the powder was sugar , because it was labeled "" sugar "" and by the coffee machine , but actually the powder was poison . So even though when the powder was poison , the friend drank the coffee and died , people say Grace deserves less blame in that case , when she innocently thought it was sugar , than in the other case , where she thought it was poison , and no harm occurred . People , though , disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame Grace should get in the accident case . Some people think she should deserve more blame , and other people less . And what I 'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they 're making that judgment . So what I 'm showing you , from left to right , is how much activity there was in this brain region . and from top to bottom , how much blame people said that Grace deserved . And what you can see is , on the left when there as very little activity in this brain region , people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident . Whereas , on the right , where there was a lot of activity , people payed a lot more attention to her innocent belief , and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident . So that 's good , but of course what we 'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region , and see if we could change people's moral judgment . And we do have such a tool . It 's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation , or TMS . This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebody's skull , into a small region of their brain , and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region . So I 'm going to show you a demo of this . First I 'm going to show you , to show you that this is a magnetic pulse , I 'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine . When you hear clicks we 're turning the machine on . So now I 'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain , to the part of my brain that controls my hand . So there is not physical force , just a magnetic pulse . Video : Woman : Ready ? Rebecca Saxe : Yes . Okay , so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain . And we can use that same pulse , now applied to the RTPJ , to ask if we can change people's moral judgments . So these are the judgments I showed you before , people's normal moral judgments . And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ and ask how people's judgments change . And the first thing is , people can still do this task overall . So their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same . They say she deserves no blame . But in the case of a failed attempt to harm , where Grace thought that it was poison , although it was really sugar , people now say it was more okay , she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee . And in the case of the accident , where she thought that it was sugar , but it was really poison and so she caused a death , people say that it was less okay , she deserves more blame . So what I 've told you today is that people come , actually , especially well equipped to think about other people's thoughts . We have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking . This system takes a long time to develop , slowly throughout the course of childhood , and into early adolescence . And even in adulthood , differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people . But I want to give the last word back to the novelists . And to Philip Roth , who ended by saying , "" The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway . It 's getting them wrong that is living . Getting them wrong and wrong and wrong , and then on careful reconsideration , getting them wrong again . "" Thank you . ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : When you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments , that sounds alarming . ( Laughter ) Please tell me that you 're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon , say . Rebecca Saxe : I 'm not . I mean , they 're calling , but I 'm not taking the call . ( Laughter ) C. A. : They really are calling ? So , then seriously , then seriously , you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads . I mean you 're clearly an incredible human being . But someone could take this knowledge and in some future not torture chamber , do acts that people here might be worried about . R. S. : Yeah , we worry about this . So , there is a couple of things to say about TMS . One is that you ca n ' t be TMSed with out knowing it . So it 's not a surreptitious technology . It 's quite hard actually to get those very small changes . The changes I showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain . But they 're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make . And what we changed was not people's moral judgments when they 're deciding what to do , when they 're making action choices . We change their ability to judge other people's actions . And so I think of what I 'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial , but studying the jury . C. A. : Is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education , to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments ? R. S. : That 's one of the idealistic hopes . The whole research program here , of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain , is brand new . Until recently what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animal's brain could do too . So we could study it in animal models . We knew how brains see , and how they control the body , and how they hear and sense . And the whole project of understanding how brains do the uniquely human things , learn language , and abstract concepts , and thinking about other people's thoughts , that 's brand new . And we do n't know yet , what the implications will be of understanding it . C. A. : So I 've got one last question . There is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness , that puzzles a lot of people . The notion that you can understand why a brain works , perhaps . But why does anyone have to feel anything ? Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate ? You 're a brilliant young neuroscientist . I mean , what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career someone , you or someone else , is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem . R. S. : I hope they do . And I think they probably wo n ' t . C. A. : Why ? R. S. : It 's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing . ( Laughter ) C. A. : That 's a great answer . Rebecca Saxe , thank you very much . That was fantastic . ( Applause ) </content"	Information/Explanation

29	"Ezra 1 Cyrus Helps the Exiles to Return 1 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah , the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing : 2 "" This is what Cyrus king of Persia says : "" ' The LORD , the God of heaven , has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah . 3 Anyone of his people among you â may his God be with him , and let him go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the LORD , the God of Israel , the God who is in Jerusalem . 4 And the people of any place where survivors may now be living are to provide him with silver and gold , with goods and livestock , and with freewill offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem . ' "" 5 Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests and Levites â everyone whose heart God had moved â prepared to go up and build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem . 6 All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold , with goods and livestock , and with valuable gifts , in addition to all the freewill offerings . 7 Moreover , King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the LORD , which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his god .

500	"Friday , 16 August , 2002 , 02 : 36 GMT 03 : 36 UK Teachers get advice on violence Teachers are increasingly concerned about violent pupils A teachers' union is so concerned about the growing incidents of violence and disruption in schools , it has issued its members with new guidance for their own protection . For the first time , diaries sent to all National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers ( NASUWT ) members this week will outline how teachers can best tackle the problem . It is unacceptable that teachers should face violence at work Eamonn O ' Kane , NASUWT The guidelines urge teachers to report all incidents of actual or threatened assault or criminal damage to the police . The advice also recommends staff be given training in avoiding and managing dangerous situations . The NASUWT calls on head teachers to introduce a code of "" zero tolerance "" towards pupils who have been excluded And parents who have been abusive or violent towards staff should be banned from school premises . A failure by schools to put in place adequate protection for teachers may lead to risk assessments for violent and disruptive pupils and a refusal to teach those who pose a real danger , the union warns . Violent pupils NASUWT general secretary Eamonn O ' Kane said : "" It is unacceptable that teachers should face violence at work . "" "" NASUWT guidance highlights options available to limit the threat . By including this in the diary , every member can carry round details of the steps necessary to protect themselves in school . "" Although the numbers of pupils excluded last year went up for the first time in the past six years , NASUWT remains concerned that governing bodies continue to readmit violent and disruptive pupils . "" Last month the Department for Education issued posters to all schools in England warning parents they faced prosecution if they threatened or abused staff . The posters , similar to those found in hospitals and on public transport , were accompanied by a "" toolkit "" setting out the legal position on parental violence ."	News
1499	DFES supports the Western Australia Police as a combat authority for urban search and rescue ( USAR ) . The agency has a developed the capability to deal with the rescue of casualties trapped by buildings , landfall or slippage which collapse as a result of industrial accidents , explosions , natural disasters and terrorist activity . Additional funding in recent years has allowed significant advances to be made in the Western Australia's preparedness , response and recovery capabilities for USAR . Category 2 , which qualifies the responder as a technician with the competencies to conduct underground searches , and ; Category 3 , which qualifies the responder to lead a USAR taskforce . To date , all career firefighters are trained to Category 1 ( CAT 1 ) and there are several Category 2 ( CAT 2 ) technicians available to respond to incidents requiring the specialised skills of the USAR Task Force . Western Australia now has a qualified USAR Canine Team to enhance our operational capacity and is the only State with an integrated canine team in its USAR Task Force . It is recognised around the world that canine teams are an essential element in the efficient and speedy location of victims trapped as a result of building collapse or earthquake . We have been working over the past two years to train a team of dogs that meet nationally and internationally recognised standards . The USAR team has adopted the New Zealand standard for USAR Canine Teams . It currently has five dogs in training with the aim of having four qualified dogs in the USAR task force in 2008-09 . A New Zealand dog trainer and assessor were brought to Perth to provide training and assessment of local State Emergency Service dogs , handlers and staff . Two dogs were assessed , one successfully . As a result , Australia has its first canine team integrated into a USAR task force and certified to international standards . National Support During the 2011 Queensland floods , four DFES Fire and Rescue Service USAR technicians worked as part of a national taskforce conducting damage assessment and recovery operations in the Brisbane area , where there was significant damage to residential , industrial and commercial structures . The USAR taskforce performed rapid damage assessments , assessed water levels and structural damage , identified hazards and prioritised tasks in a difficult environment of escalating odours from hazardous materials , putrefying foods and the thick layer of mud left by receding floodwaters . Following the magnitude 6.3 earthquake that occurred in Christchurch on 22 February 2011 , six DFES USAR specialists departed on 4 March 2011 for a 12 day deployment . They joined USAR teams from New Zealand , Australia , USA , UK , Singapore , Taiwan , Japan and China in Christchurch . Working alongside structural engineers , seismologists , geologists , construction workers , crane and digger operators and demolition experts , the USAR team undertook a range of activities while maintaining a state of preparedness to respond to further aftershocks . They searched for missing persons , conducted primary and secondary risk assessments of buildings prior to re-habitation , undertook building marking , cordoning and demarcation of identified collapse zones and assisted police to retrieve personal belongings from damaged buildings . As part of the first Australian multi-jurisdictional USAR task force deployed overseas , DFES team members gained valuable operational experience in a major disaster as well as establishing and extending important ' special risk ' networks across national and international jurisdictions . International Support The relationship between DFES and the Singapore Civil Defence Force was consolidated further through : continued mutual training and professional development exchange opportunities â six career firefighters visited Singapore in December 2006 to undertake USAR CAT2 training . exchange of information and ideas in regard to operational procedures , research and development , equipment and training simulations .

919	"Three Boys ; or the Chiefs of the Clan Mackhai George Manville Fenn | Next chapter | | Contents | Chapter I. The Mackhai of Dun Roe . "" Look here , Scoodrach , if you call me she again , I 'll kick you ! "" "" I didna ca ' you she . I only said if she 'd come ten the hoose aifter she had the parritch -- "" "" Well , what did I say ? "" "" Say ? Why , she got in a passion . "" Whop ! Flop ! The sound of a back-handed slap in the chest , followed by a kick , both delivered by Kenneth Mackhai , the recipient being a red-headed , freckled-faced lad of seventeen , who retaliated by making a sharp snatch at the kicking foot , which he caught and held one half moment . The result was startling . Kenneth Mackhai , the sun-browned , well-knit , handsome son of "" the Chief , "" came down in a sitting position on the stones , and screwed up his face with pain . "" Scood , you beggar ! "" he roared ; "" I 'll serve you out for -- "" "" Ken , are you coming to breakfast ? "" cried a loud , severe voice from fifty yards away . "" Coming , father ! "" shouted the lad , leaping up , giving himself a shake to rearrange his dark green kilt , and holding up his fist threateningly at the bare-legged , grinning lad before him . "" Just you wait till after breakfast , Master Scood , and I 'll make you squint . "" The lad ran up the steep slope to the garden surrounding the ancient castle of Dunroe , which had been built as a stronghold somewhere about the fourteenth century , and still stood solid on its rocky foundation ; a square , keep-like edifice , with a round tower at each corner , mouldering , with portions of the battlements broken away , but a fine monument still of the way in which builders worked in the olden time . The portion Kenneth Mackhai approached had for inhabitants only the jackdaws , which encumbered the broken stairs by the loopholes with their nests ; but , after passing beneath a gloomy archway and crossing the open interior , he left the old keep by another archway , to enter the precincts of the modern castle of Dunroe , a commodious building , erected after the style of the old , and possessing the advantages of a roof and floors , with large windows looking across the dazzling sea . Kenneth entered a handsome dining-room , where the breakfast was spread , and where his father , The Mackhai , a tall , handsome man of fifty , was pacing angrily up and down . "" Sorry I kept you , father . Scood said there was a seal on the lower rocks , and -- "" "" The scoundrel ! How dare he ? "" muttered The Mackhai . "" To take such a mean advantage of his position . I will not suffer it . I 'll -- "" "" I 'm very sorry , father ! "" faltered Kenneth , crossing slowly toward his frowning elder . "" I did not mean to -- "" "" Eh ! what , Ken , my boy ? "" cried The Mackhai , with his countenance changing . "" I 've only just come in . Sit down , my lad . You must be half-starved , eh ? "" "" I thought you were cross with me , sir . "" "" Cross ? Angry ? Not a bit . Why ? "" "" You said -- "" "" Tchah ! nonsense ! Thinking aloud . What did you say ? -- a seal ? "" "" Yes , father . Scood said there was one , but it had gone . "" "" Then you did n't shoot it ? Well , I 'm not sorry . They 're getting scarce now , and I like to see the old things about the old place . Hah ! "" he continued , after a pause that had been well employed by both at the amply-supplied , handsomely-furnished table ; "" and I like the old porridge for breakfast . Give me some of that salmon , Ken. No ; I 'll have a kipper . "" "" More coffee , please , father , "" said Ken , with his mouth full . "" Have a scone , father ? They 're prime . "" "" Gently with the butter , my boy . There is such a thing as bile . "" "" Is there , father ? "" said Kenneth , who was spreading the rich yellow churning a full quarter of an inch thick . "" Is there , sir ! Yes , there is . As I know to my cost . Ah ! "" he added , with a sigh , and his face wrinkled and made him look ten years older ; "" but there was a time when I did not know the meaning of the word ! "" "" Oh , I say , father , "" cried Kenneth merrily , "" do n't ! You 're always pretending to be old , and yet you can walk me down stalking , and Long Shon says you can make him sore-footed any day . "" "" Nonsense ! nonsense ! "" said The Mackhai , smiling . "" Oh , but you can , father ! "" said Kenneth , with his mouth full . "" And see how you ran with that salmon yesterday , all among the stones . "" "" Ah , yes ! I manage to hold my own ; but I hope you 'll husband your strength better than I did , my boy , "" said The Mackhai , with a sigh . "" I only hope I shall grow into such a fine man ! "" cried Kenneth , with his face lighting up , as he gazed proudly at his father . "" Why , Donald says -- "" "" Tut , tut , tut ! Silence , you miserable young flatterer ! Do you want to make your father conceited ? There , that will do . "" "" Coming fishing to-day , father ? "" There was no answer . The Mackhai had taken up a letter brought in that morning by one of the gillies , and was frowning over it as he re-read its contents , and then sat thoughtfully gazing out of the window across the glittering sea , at the blue mountains in the distance , tapping the table with his fingers the while . "" Wonder what 's the matter ! "" thought Kenneth . "" Some one wants some money , I suppose . "" The boy's face puckered up a little as he ceased eating , and watched his father's face , the furrows in the boy's brow giving him a wonderful likeness to the keen-eyed , high-browed representative of a fine old Scottish clan . "" Wish I had plenty of money , "" thought Kenneth ; and he sighed as he saw his father's face darken . Not that there was the faintest sign of poverty around , for the room was tastily furnished in good old style ; the carpet was thick , a silver coffee-pot glistened upon the table , and around the walls were goodly paintings of ancestral Mackhais , from the bare-armed , scale-armoured chief who fought the Macdougals of Lome , down to Ronald Mackhai , who represented Ross-shire when King William sat upon the throne . "" I ca n't help myself , "" muttered The Mackhai at last . "" Here , Ken , what were you going to do to-day ? "" "" I was going up the river after a salmon . "" "" Not to-day , my boy . Here , I 've news for you . Mr. Blande , my London solicitor , writes me word that his son is coming down--a boy about your age . "" "" Son--coming down ? Did you invite him , father ? "" "" Eh ? No : never mind that , "" said The Mackhai hastily . "" Coming down to stay with us a bit . Regular London boy . Not in very good health . You must be civil to him , Ken , and show him about a bit . "" "" Yes , father , "" said Kenneth , who felt from his father's manner that the coming guest was not welcome . "" He is coming by Glasgow , and then by the Grenadier . His father thinks the sea will do him good . Go and meet him . "" "" Yes , father . "" "" Tell them to get a room ready for him . "" "" Yes , father . "" "" Be as civil to him as you can , and--Pah ! "" That ejaculation , pah ! came like an angry outburst , as The Mackhai gave the table a sharp blow , and rose and strode out of the room . Kenneth sat watching the door for a few moments . "" Father's savage because he 's coming , "" said Kenneth , whose eyes then fell upon a glass dish of marmalade , and , cutting a goodly slice of bread , he spread it with the yellow butter , and then spooned out a portion of the amber-hued preserve . "" Bother the chap ! we do n't want him here . "" Pe-au , pe-au , came a wailing whistle through the open window . "" Ah , I hear you , old whaupie , but I can do it better than that , "" said Kenneth to himself , as he repeated the whistle , in perfect imitation of the curlews which abounded near . The whistle was answered , and , with a good-tempered smile on his face , Kenneth rose from the table , after cutting another slice of bread , and laying it upon that in his plate , so as to form a sticky sandwich . "" Scood ! "" he cried from the window , and barelegged Scoodrach , who was seated upon a rock right below , with the waves splashing his feet , looked up and showed his white teeth . "" Catch ! "" "" All right . "" Down went the bread and marmalade , which the lad caught in his blue worsted bonnet , and was about to replace the same upon his curly red head , but the glutinous marmalade came off on one finger . This sticky finger he sucked as he stared at the bread , and , evidently coming to the conclusion that preserve and pomade were not synonymous terms , he began rapidly to put the sweet sandwich somewhere else . "" I wish you had kept it in your bonnet , Scood . "" The boy looked up and laughed , his mouth busy the while . "" Father saw sax saumon in the black pool , "" he cried eagerly . "" Then they 'll have to stop , "" said Kenneth gloomily . "" Eh ? "" "" There 's a chap coming down from London . "" "" To fesh ? "" "" Suppose so . We 've got to go and meet him . "" "" With ta pony ? "" "" No , the boat ; coming by the Grenadier . "" "" Ou ay . "" "" It 's a great bother , Scood . "" "" But it 's a verra fine mornin ' for a sail , "" said the boy , looking up and munching away . "" But I did n't want to sail ; I wanted to fish . "" "" The fush can wait , tat she can . "" "" Oh , you ! "" shouted Kenneth . "" Wish I had something to throw at you . "" "" If she did , I 'd throw it back , "" said Scoodrach , grinning . "" I should like to catch you at it . There , go and get the boat . "" "" Plenty of time . "" "" Never mind that ; let 's be off and have a good sail first , as we have to go . "" "" Will she--will you tak ' the gun ? "" "" Of course I shall . Take the lines too , Scood ; we may get a mackerel . "" The lad opened his large mouth , tucked in the last piece of marmalade , and then leaped off the stone on to the rock . "" Scood ! "" The boy stroked down his grey kilt , and looked up . "" Put on your shoes and stockings . "" "" What for ? "" "" Because I tell you . Because there 's company coming . Be off ! "" "" She 's got a big hole in her stocking , and ta shoe hurts her heel . "" "" Be off and put them on , "" roared Kenneth from the window . "" I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour . "" Scood nodded , and began to climb rapidly over the buttress of rock which ran down into the sea , the height to which the tide rose being marked by an encrustation of myriads of acorn barnacles , among which every now and then a limpet stood out like a boss , while below , in the clear water , a thick growth of weed turned the rock to a golden brown , and changed the tint of the transparent water . | Next chapter | | Contents | Created from a nineteenth or early twentieth century text by Athelstane E-Texts"	Prose/Lyrical
1555	"Throughout the life of the El Camino , ad images emphasized both its sporty profile and its pickup truck-style rear , which was perfect for hauling groceries , furniture , or the kid's bicycles . The powers-that-be at Chevrolet tweaked this "" all things to all men "" formula throughout the vehicle's production years . In 1968 , these efforts resulted in the introduction of an SS package . This was essentially a carbon copy of the Chevelle Super Sport's options , including Chevy's legendary Turbo Jet 396 cubic inch engine . With this V8 monster under its hood , the El Camino could wrap up the quarter-mile in 14 seconds â respectable for the time and not too bad by today's standards . There was one crucial difference between the Chevelle and El Camino SS packages , however . Try as they might , builders could not adapt the Chevelle's heavy-duty rear anti-sway suspension to the hybrid truck-sports car frame . This was due to the fact that the El Camino was originally designed to haul freight , not burn rubber . It points out the problems that inevitably arise when a company tries to please everyone . The El Camino SS came closer than any other attempt to bridge divide between rebellious youth and responsible adulthood , however . For that alone , it deserves its place in automotive history ."

653	"Imogen Heap is best known for her ethereal voice and the ability to mix electronica , rock and pop . Here , she speaks with Megan M. Retka about her record company woes and having her bed set on fire ... MR : You 've had quite a formal musical history . You were trained as a classical pianist ? IH : First things first , was the piano . We had a piano at my parent's house in Essex , and I think as a kid you 'd obviously want to make noise on something , and thing that would make the most noise in my house was the piano . So , I used to play the piano very badly from as soon as I could reach [ it ] , and I do n't remember going to my first lesson . As far as I know , I 've always played the piano . And obviously I did n't at some point because I was , like , a baby , but I 've always felt like I 've played it . I guess , as a kid , I would just hear sounds and try and imitate them , and gradually as I became conscious that I was actually playing a piano and I wanted to learn more , that 's when my parents tried to get me lessons . I wanted to get lessons even before my feet would reach the pedal , [ but ] I could n't have my first lesson until my foot would reach the pedal . Luckily , I got there quicker than most because I 'm quite tall . So , I learned classically . I did all my lessons and I did my grades on the piano , and I learned about theory as well . Then , as I became a bit older , maybe about eight , I started learning cello . Well , actually I started learning the violin , but I hated the violin . You have to spend hours and hours rehearsing to get even a decent sound out of the violin , but luckily with the cello , it looks great instantly . Yeah , it 's not quite [ such a ] jarring , screechy noise . By this point , I kind of decided I wanted to be a composer . I wanted to compose and conduct orchestras and play pianos for orchestras and write for film - things like that . That was my plan as a kid . And then I thought , well if I learn a string instrument and a percussive instrument , then I need to learn a woodwind , so then I learned the clarinet . I tried to go one stage further and learn the trumpet , but that was n't to be . I stopped at brass . I really enjoyed writing and composing for instruments and the orchestra , and as a kid that was about the only subject that I really , you know , spend time on the homework and actually get excited about a string quartet . I think the other reason is , maybe partly , is that when I was a kid , I realised that the more instruments I played , the more academic lessons I could get out of . So , that was quite cool . Later , when I was about twelve , I went to a boarding school . The music school there , was really really amazing . They had loads of pianos - they had 24 pianos . I guess they really thought that people in the school would want to play the piano if they 've got all those hours to wile away after lessons . Of course , I was in there every night playing the piano , and soon realised that Mr. Dodge , was his name , had a toy room where he had a computer - an old Mac Classic . You could write notes and things like that on this program he had called Notator . I kind of realised that quite early on and was like , "" Hmm . I really want to get into that . "" But he said , "" Well , you ca n't really use that until a bit later . "" So , when it came to doing GCSEs , I then learned about this computer . I was thirteen when I did my GSCEs , because I was always a year ahead . I start using this gear when I was about thirteen . I did n't get on with my music master at all . It was just me and him in GCSE class . Just me and him . In a quiet , eerie room , pencils scribbling - it 's all very eerie . So , I 'd get there and talk to him , and after about five seconds we 'd be at each other 's throats arguing with each other - I was a bit of a rebel - so he was like , "" Ok . I 've had about enough of you . Go into that room and make some music . "" So , I 'd basically have an hour , three times a week , to read this massive manual of this computer , to figure out how to use it . As soon as I realised that I could do this with this computer - create like a whole orchestra without having to actually have an orchestra - I was hooked . From the beginning . That 's when my love of programming started . Throughout the years I just got better and better at it .

1618	"The 10X Extreme is a rather sharp looking cooler . Overall it does n't look or feel like it 's been fabricated from a tin can . Many CPU coolers have made the mistake of using low quality , thinner aluminum for their fins . It 's unlike many of the performance tower coolers in that it comes assembled with a mounted 120mm blue LED cooling fan of Zalman's choice . Many enthusiasts like to use fans of their own choice . However , if the 120mm fan used here is of decent quality , we see no reason why it will ever be an issue even amongst DIY enthusiasts . Overall , the 10X Extreme rather solid cooler . It 's roughly 5 inches wide by 6.25 inches tall x 4 inches deep . Most of that size comes from the fan frame which is actually more of a "" cap "" of sorts sitting on top with two small screws holding the fan in place . Basically , just for show but does add a nice finished quality to the product . Mentioned earlier , the cooler contains a controller known as the PWM Mate . The unique thing about the PWM Mate is that it can be disconnected from the cooler and act as a wired remote when coupled with the included extension cable . Users can allow the Mate to hang or mount on the back of their computer case for easier control . It saves you time from having to open and close the chassis . The entire cooler is made from or covered in what Zalman has dubbed "" Black Pearl "" Nickel Plating . We counted 5 full length U-shaped heat pipes running the full length and most the width of the cooler . The fins are noticeably thicker and make a rather tight fit , or connection , against the heat pipes than many other tower coolers . This should better help transfer heat from the pipes to the fins . Despite appearances , we definitely noticed the superb mirror like finish on the non-copper colored base . Copper has always proven to be the best material for heat sinks . And , the mirror finish ensures that there 's maximum transference of heat from the CPU to the base as well as through the heat pipes . We think you 've patiently drooled long enough . Let 's see what this beauty can do . Installation Notes and Test Setup First , our test system was thoroughly cleaned and prepped using Artic Clean's products . To eliminate any variables between test coolers , a third party compound from Artic Silver 5 was used in place of Zalman's thermal compound . No doubt that Zalman's would be the ideal choice over any generic compounds , but we want to present the most uniform test experience . The manual was clear on which LGA1366 components to use . The black bracket was a little loose even with the washer and screws thoroughly tightened . We figure the motherboard's PCB is just a little thinner than the boards Zalman's engineers used in development . While it should n't affect performance , we did n't want to take a chance , so an extra washer was added to each bottom bolt to tighten it up nicely . The only sticky point was getting the top chrome fastening plate oriented properly while setting the cooler on the CPU . It can be tricky so take your time , eye the placement as best you can as you set it in place . After tightening the screws , it was extremely secure without any movement . Just what we like to see . Our hexa-core processor is a beast of a processor . It can get pretty warm pushing any cooler to its thermal limits . If this performance grade CPU cooler can cool the Core i7-980X , it will easily cool any other processor available , including AMD's upcoming Phenom II X6s . Image Gallery"	Promotion
1268	AUTHORS Michael Massimi & Daniela Rosner ABSTRACT Technology increasingly plays a role in the way that we prepare for , celebrate , and reflect upon major life events . Modern digital artefacts , such as Facebook messages and digital photos , now stand alongside traditional artefacts , such as guest books and heirloom jewellery , as cherished mementos of these occasions . Considering how these physical artefacts are crafted provides a useful lens for understanding the evolving relationship among digital tools , the artefacts they produce , and the major life events where these artefacts are used and imbued with meaning . In this paper , we present themes from an interview study conducted with crafters who created items for major life events including weddings , household moves , and births . Our findings outline properties of the crafting process and of the crafted items . Across all occasions , crafters saw major life events as opportunities to learn new skills and use special materials to create personalized artefacts that codified and extended interpersonal relationships . This occurred in parallel with a creative , thoughtful process to make crafts that were appropriate for each occasion and meaningful enough to be kept and treasured for years to come . We reflect on the properties of these crafters' processes and artefacts , and suggest implications for the role of digital tools and assets in relation to major life events . In particular , digital ways to reveal an artefact's provenance and relationship to an event may be useful for augmenting its symbolic meaning and its ability to represent interpersonal relationships .

1637	Sometimes it 's hard to get a handle on the vastness of the universe . How far is an astronomical unit , anyhow ? In this list we 've brought the universe down to a more manageable scale . NASA The universe is a big place , but let 's cut it down to size by making the Earth the size of a Ping-Pong ball . On that scale it would be placed 500 yards ( 460 meters ) from the Sun . NASA The Sun would be a little over 14 feet ( 4 meters ) in diameter , about the size of a large gazebo . Photo NASA / JPL / Caltech ( NASA photo # PIA00405 ) On this scale the Moon would be a marble 4 feet ( 1 . 2 meters ) from Earth . NASA / JPL The planet Mercury would be the size of a large marble 2 ( gridiron ) football fields away from the Sun .

47	"The next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly , and about three o ' clock in the afternoon went to call on Mme . de Restaud . On the way thither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young head so full of delicious excitement . Young men at his age take no account of obstacles nor of dangers ; they see success in every direction ; imagination has free play , and turns their lives into a romance ; they are saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of the visionary schemes that have no existence save in their heated fancy . If youth were not ignorant and timid , civilization would be impossible . Eugene took unheard-of pains to keep himself in a spotless condition , but on his way through the streets he began to think about Mme . de Restaud and what he should say to her . He equipped himself with wit , rehearsed repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation , and prepared certain neat speeches a la Talleyrand , conjuring up a series of small events which should prepare the way for the declaration on which he had based his future ; and during these musings the law student was bespattered with mud , and by the time he reached the Palais Royal he was obliged to have his boots blacked and his trousers brushed . "" If I were rich , "" he said , as he changed the five-franc piece he had brought with him in case anything might happen , "" I would take a cab , then I could think at my ease . "" At last he reached the Rue du Helder , and asked for the Comtesse de Restaud . He bore the contemptuous glances of the servants , who had seen him cross the court on foot , with the cold fury of a man who knows that he will succeed some day . He understood the meaning of their glances at once , for he had felt his inferiority as soon as he entered the court , where a smart cab was waiting . All the delights of life in Paris seemed to be implied by this visible and manifest sign of luxury and extravagance . A fine horse , in magnificent harness , was pawing the ground , and all at once the law student felt out of humor with himself . Every compartment in his brain which he had thought to find so full of wit was bolted fast ; he grew positively stupid . He sent up his name to the Countess , and waited in the ante-chamber , standing on one foot before a window that looked out upon the court ; mechanically he leaned his elbow against the sash , and stared before him . The time seemed long ; he would have left the house but for the southern tenacity of purpose which works miracles when it is single-minded . "" Madame is in her boudoir , and can not see any one at present , sir , "" said the servant . "" She gave me no answer ; but if you will go into the dining-room , there is some one already there . "" Rastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the lackey who can accuse or condemn his masters by a word ; he coolly opened the door by which the man had just entered the ante-chamber , meaning , no doubt , to show these insolent flunkeys that he was familiar with the house ; but he found that he had thoughtlessly precipitated himself into a small room full of dressers , where lamps were standing , and hot-water pipes , on which towels were being dried ; a dark passage and a back staircase lay beyond it . Stifled laughter from the ante-chamber added to his confusion . "" This way to the drawing-room , sir , "" said the servant , with the exaggerated respect which seemed to be one more jest at his expense . Eugene turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath . By good luck , he managed to keep his hat on his head , and saved it from immersion in the water ; but just as he turned , a door opened at the further end of the dark passage , dimly lighted by a small lamp . Rastignac heard voices and the sound of a kiss ; one of the speakers was Mme . de Restaud , the other was Father Goriot . Eugene followed the servant through the dining-room into the drawing-room ; he went to a window that looked out into the courtyard , and stood there for a while . He meant to know whether this Goriot was really the Goriot that he knew . His heart beat unwontedly fast ; he remembered Vautrin's hideous insinuations . A well-dressed young man suddenly emerged from the room almost as Eugene entered it , saying impatiently to the servant who stood at the door : "" I am going , Maurice . Tell Madame la Comtesse that I waited more than half an hour for her . "" Whereupon this insolent being , who , doubtless , had a right to be insolent , sang an Italian trill , and went towards the window where Eugene was standing , moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see the student's face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard . "" But M. le Comte had better wait a moment longer ; madame is disengaged , "" said Maurice , as he returned to the ante-chamber . Just at that moment Father Goriot appeared close to the gate ; he had emerged from a door at the foot of the back staircase . The worthy soul was preparing to open his umbrella regardless of the fact that the great gate had opened to admit a tilbury , in which a young man with a ribbon at his button-hole was seated . Father Goriot had scarcely time to start back and save himself . The horse took fright at the umbrella , swerved , and dashed forward towards the flight of steps . The young man looked round in annoyance , saw Father Goriot , and greeted him as he went out with constrained courtesy , such as people usually show to a money-lender so long as they require his services , or the sort of respect they feel it necessary to show for some one whose reputation has been blown upon , so that they blush to acknowledge his acquaintance . Father Goriot gave him a little friendly nod and a good-natured smile . All this happened with lightning speed . Eugene was so deeply interested that he forgot that he was not alone till he suddenly heard the Countess' voice . "" Oh ! Maxime , were you going away ? "" she said reproachfully , with a shade of pique in her manner . The Countess had not seen the incident nor the entrance of the tilbury . Rastignac turned abruptly and saw her standing before him , coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere gown with knots of rose-colored ribbon here and there ; her hair was carelessly coiled about her head , as is the wont of Parisian women in the morning ; there was a soft fragrance about her--doubtless she was fresh from a bath ; -- her graceful form seemed more flexible , her beauty more luxuriant . Her eyes glistened . A young man can see everything at a glance ; he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns and absorbs its nutriment from the air ; he did not need to touch her hands to feel their cool freshness . He saw faint rose tints through the cashmere of the dressing gown ; it had fallen slightly open , giving glimpses of a bare throat , on which the student's eyes rested . The Countess had no need of the adventitious aid of corsets ; her girdle defined the outlines of her slender waist ; her throat was a challenge to love ; her feet , thrust into slippers , were daintily small . As Maxime took her hand and kissed it , Eugene became aware of Maxime's existence , and the Countess saw Eugene . "" Oh ! is that you M. de Rastignac ? I am very glad to see you , "" she said , but there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer would have taken as a hint to depart . Maxime , as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the haughty insolence of bearing , looked from Eugene to the lady , and from the lady to Eugene ; it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be rid of the latter . An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might be given in the words : "" Look here , my dear ; I hope you intend to send this little whipper-snapper about his business . "" The Countess consulted the young man's face with an intent submissiveness that betrays all the secrets of a woman's heart , and Rastignac all at once began to hate him violently . To begin with , the sight of the fair carefully arranged curls on the other 's comely head had convinced him that his own crop was hideous ; Maxime's boots , moreover , were elegant and spotless , while his own , in spite of all his care , bore some traces of his recent walk ; and , finally , Maxime's overcoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully , he looked like a pretty woman , while Eugene was wearing a black coat at half-past two . The quick-witted child of the Charente felt the disadvantage at which he was placed beside this tall , slender dandy , with the clear gaze and the pale face , one of those men who would ruin orphan children without scruple . Mme . de Restaud fled into the next room without waiting for Eugene to speak ; shaking out the skirts of her dressing-gown in her flight , so that she looked like a white butterfly , and Maxime hurried after her . Eugene , in a fury , followed Maxime and the Countess , and the three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the large drawing-room . The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime found him in the way , and even at the risk of displeasing Mme . de Restaud , he meant to annoy the dandy . It had struck him all at once that he had seen the young man before at Mme . de Beauseant's ball ; he guessed the relation between Maxime and Mme . de Restaud ; and with the youthful audacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal success , he said to himself , "" This is my rival ; I mean to cut him out . "" Rash resolve ! He did not know that M. le Comte Maxime de Trailles would wait till he was insulted , so as to fire first and kill his man . Eugene was a sportsman and a good shot , but he had not yet hit the bulls's eye twenty times out of twenty-two . The young Count dropped into a low chair by the hearth , took up the tongs , and made up the fire so violently and so sulkily , that Anastasie's fair face suddenly clouded over . She turned to Eugene , with a cool , questioning glance that asked plainly , "" Why do you not go ? "" a glance which well-bred people regard as a cue to make their exit . Eugene assumed an amiable expression . "" Madame , "" he began , "" I hastened to call upon you ---- "" He stopped short . The door opened , and the owner of the tilbury suddenly appeared . He had left his hat outside , and did not greet the Countess ; he looked meditatively at Rastignac , and held out his hand to Maxime with a cordial "" Good morning , "" that astonished Eugene not a little . The young provincial did not understand the amenities of a triple alliance . "" M. de Restaud , "" said the Countess , introducing her husband to the law student . Eugene bowed profoundly . "" This gentleman , "" she continued , presenting Eugene to her husband , "" is M. de Rastignac ; he is related to Mme . la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs ; I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last ball . "" _Related to Mme . la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs ! _ These words , on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis , by reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing that she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house , produced a magical effect . The Count's stiff manner relaxed at once as he returned the student's bow . "" Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance , "" he said . Maxime de Trailles himself gave Eugene an uneasy glance , and suddenly dropped his insolent manner . The mighty name had all the power of a fairy's wand ; those closed compartments in the southern brain flew open again ; Rastignac's carefully drilled faculties returned . It was as if a sudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of Paris , and he began to see , though everything was indistinct as yet . Mme . Vauquer's lodging-house and Father Goriot were very far remote from his thoughts . "" I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct , "" the Comte de Restaud said , addressing Eugene . "" Yes , they are extinct , "" answered the law student . "" My great-uncle , the Chevalier de Rastignac , married the heiress of the Marcillac family . They had only one daughter , who married the Marechal de Clarimbault , Mme . de Beauseant's grandfather on the mother's side . We are the younger branch of the family , and the younger branch is all the poorer because my great-uncle , the Vice-Admiral , lost all that he had in the King's service . The Government during the Revolution refused to admit our claims when the Compagnie des Indes was liquidated . "" "" Was not your great-uncle in command of the _Vengeur_ before 1789 ? "" "" Yes . "" "" Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather , who commanded the _Warwick_ . "" Maxime looked at Mme . de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders , as who should say , "" If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that fellow , it is all over with us . "" Anastasie understood the glance that M. de Trailles gave her . With a woman's admirable tact , she began to smile and said : "" Come with me , Maxime ; I have something to say to you . We will leave you two gentlemen to sail in company on board the _Warwick_ and the _Vengeur_ . "" She rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her , mirth and mischief in her whole attitude , and the two went in the direction of the boudoir . The _morganatic_ couple ( to use a convenient German expression which has no exact equivalent ) had reached the door , when the Count interrupted himself in his talk with Eugene . "" Anastasie ! "" he cried pettishly , "" just stay a moment , dear ; you know very well that ---- "" "" I am coming back in a minute , "" she interrupted ; "" I have a commission for Maxime to execute , and I want to tell him about it . "" She came back almost immediately . She had noticed the inflection in her husband's voice , and knew that it would not be safe to retire to the boudoir ; like all women who are compelled to study their husbands' characters in order to have their own way , and whose business it is to know exactly how far they can go without endangering a good understanding , she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in domestic life . It was Eugene who had brought about this untoward incident ; so the Countess looked at Maxime and indicated the law student with an air of exasperation . M. de Trailles addressed the Count , the Countess , and Eugene with the pointed remark , "" You are busy , I do not want to interrupt you ; good-day , "" and he went . "" Just wait a moment , Maxime ! "" the Count called after him . "" Come and dine with us , "" said the Countess , leaving Eugene and her husband together once more . She followed Maxime into the little drawing-room , where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure that Rastignac had taken his leave . The law student heard their laughter , and their voices , and the pauses in their talk ; he grew malicious , exerted his conversational powers for M. de Restaud , flattered him , and drew him into discussions , to the end that he might see the Countess again and discover the nature of her relations with Father Goriot . This Countess with a husband and a lover , for Maxime clearly was her lover , was a mystery . What was the secret tie that bound her to the old tradesman ? This mystery he meant to penetrate , hoping by its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over this fair typical Parisian . "" Anastasie ! "" the Count called again to his wife . "" Poor Maxime ! "" she said , addressing the young man . "" Come , we must resign ourselves . This evening ---- "" "" I hope , Nasie , "" he said in her ear , "" that you will give orders not to admit that youngster , whose eyes light up like live coals when he looks at you . He will make you a declaration , and compromise you , and then you will compel me to kill him . "" "" Are you mad , Maxime ? "" she said . "" A young lad of a student is , on the contrary , a capital lightning-conductor ; is not that so ? Of course , I mean to make Restaud furiously jealous of him . "" Maxime burst out laughing , and went out , followed by the Countess , who stood at the window to watch him into his carriage ; he shook his whip , and made his horse prance . She only returned when the great gate had been closed after him . "" What do you think , dear ? "" cried the Count , her husband , "" this gentleman's family estate is not far from Verteuil , on the Charente ; his great-uncle and my grandfather were acquainted . "" "" Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common , "" said the Countess , with a preoccupied manner . "" More than you think , "" said Eugene , in a low voice . "" What do you mean ? "" she asked quickly . "" Why , only just now , "" said the student , "" I saw a gentleman go out at the gate , Father Goriot , my next door neighbor in the house where I am lodging . "" At the sound of this name , and the prefix that embellished it , the Count , who was stirring the fire , let the tongs fall as though they had burned his fingers , and rose to his feet . "" Sir , "" he cried , "" you might have called him ' Monsieur Goriot ' ! "" The Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husband's vexation , then she reddened ; clearly she was embarrassed , her answer was made in a tone that she tried to make natural , and with an air of assumed carelessness : "" You could not know any one who is dearer to us both ... "" She broke off , glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her mind , and asked , "" Are you fond of music , M. de Rastignac ? "" "" Exceedingly , "" answered Eugene , flushing , and disconcerted by a dim suspicion that he had somehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly . "" Do you sing ? "" she cried , going to the piano , and , sitting down before it , she swept her fingers over the keyboard from end to end . R-r-r-rah ! "" No , madame . "" The Comte de Restaud walked to and fro . "" That is a pity ; you are without one great means of success . -- _Ca-ro , ca-a-ro , ca-a-a-ro , non du-bi-ta-re_ , "" sang the Countess . Eugene had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Goriot's name , but the effect seemed to be entirely opposite to that produced by the formula "" related to Mme . de Beauseant . "" His position was not unlike that of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private collection of curiosities , when by inadvertence he comes into collision with a glass case full of sculptured figures , and three or four heads , imperfectly secured , fall at the shock . He wished the earth would open and swallow him . Mme . de Restaud's expression was reserved and chilly , her eyes had grown indifferent , and sedulously avoided meeting those of the unlucky student of law . "" Madame , "" he said , "" you wish to talk with M. de Restaud ; permit me to wish you good-day ---- "" The Countess interrupted him by a gesture , saying hastily , "" Whenever you come to see us , both M. de Restaud and I shall be delighted to see you . "" Eugene made a profound bow and took his leave , followed by M. de Restaud , who insisted , in spite of his remonstrances , on accompanying him into the hall . "" Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he calls , "" the Count said to Maurice . As Eugene set foot on the steps , he saw that it was raining . "" Come , "" said he to himself , "" somehow I have just made a mess of it , I do not know how . And now I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the bargain . I ought to stop in my corner , grind away at law , and never look to be anything but a boorish country magistrate . How can I go into society , when to manage properly you want a lot of cabs , varnished boots , gold watch chains , and all sorts of things ; you have to wear white doeskin gloves that cost six francs in the morning , and primrose kid gloves every evening ? A fig for that old humbug of a Goriot ! "" When he reached the street door , the driver of a hackney coach , who had probably just deposited a wedding party at their door , and asked nothing better than a chance of making a little money for himself without his employer's knowledge , saw that Eugene had no umbrella , remarked his black coat , white waistcoat , yellow gloves , and varnished boots , and stopped and looked at him inquiringly . Eugene , in the blind desperation that drives a young man to plunge deeper and deeper into an abyss , as if he might hope to find a fortunate issue in its lowest depths , nodded in reply to the driver's signal , and stepped into the cab ; a few stray petals of orange blossom and scraps of wire bore witness to its recent occupation by a wedding party . "" Where am I to drive , sir ? "" demanded the man , who , by this time , had taken off his white gloves . "" Confound it ! "" Eugene said to himself , "" I am in for it now , and at least I will not spend cab-hire for nothing ! -- Drive to the Hotel Beauseant , "" he said aloud . "" Which ? "" asked the man , a portentous word that reduced Eugene to confusion . This young man of fashion , species incerta , did not know that there were two Hotels Beauseant ; he was not aware how rich he was in relations who did not care about him . "" The Vicomte de Beauseant , Rue ---- "" "" De Grenelle , "" interrupted the driver , with a jerk of his head . "" You see , there are the hotels of the Marquis and Comte de Beauseant in the Rue Saint-Dominique , "" he added , drawing up the step . "" I know all about that , "" said Eugene , severely . -- "" Everybody is laughing at me to-day , it seems ! "" he said to himself , as he deposited his hat on the opposite seat . "" This escapade will cost me a king's ransom , but , at any rate , I shall call on my so-called cousin in a thoroughly aristocratic fashion . Goriot has cost me ten francs already , the old scoundrel . My word ! I will tell Mme . de Beauseant about my adventure ; perhaps it may amuse her . Doubtless she will know the secret of the criminal relation between that handsome woman and the old rat without a tail . It would be better to find favor in my cousin's eyes than to come in contact with that shameless woman , who seems to me to have very expensive tastes . Surely the beautiful Vicomtesse's personal interest would turn the scale for me , when the mere mention of her name produces such an effect . Let us look higher . If you set yourself to carry the heights of heaven , you must face God . "" The innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed up in these phrases . He grew calmer , and recovered something of his assurance as he watched the falling rain . He told himself that though he was about to squander two of the precious five-franc pieces that remained to him , the money was well laid out in preserving his coat , boots , and hat ; and his cabman's cry of "" Gate , if you please , "" almost put him in spirits . A Swiss , in scarlet and gold , appeared , the great door groaned on its hinges , and Rastignac , with sweet satisfaction , beheld his equipage pass under the archway and stop before the flight of steps beneath the awning . The driver , in a blue-and-red greatcoat , dismounted and let down the step . As Eugene stepped out of the cab , he heard smothered laughter from the peristyle . Three or four lackeys were making merry over the festal appearance of the vehicle . In another moment the law student was enlightened as to the cause of their hilarity ; he felt the full force of the contrast between his equipage and one of the smartest broughams in Paris ; a coachman , with powdered hair , seemed to find it difficult to hold a pair of spirited horses , who stood chafing the bit . In Mme . de Restaud's courtyard , in the Chaussee d ' Antin , he had seen the neat turnout of a young man of six-and-twenty ; in the Faubourg Saint-Germain he found the luxurious equipage of a man of rank ; thirty thousand francs would not have purchased it . "" Who can be here ? "" said Eugene to himself . He began to understand , though somewhat tardily , that he must not expect to find many women in Paris who were not already appropriated , and that the capture of one of these queens would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed . "" Confound it all ! I expect my cousin also has her Maxime . "" He went up the steps , feeling that he was a blighted being . The glass door was opened for him ; the servants were as solemn as jackasses under the curry comb . So far , Eugene had only been in the ballroom on the ground floor of the Hotel Beauseant ; the fete had followed so closely on the invitation , that he had not had time to call on his cousin , and had therefore never seen Mme . de Beauseant's apartments ; he was about to behold for the first time a great lady among the wonderful and elegant surroundings that reveal her character and reflect her daily life . He was the more curious , because Mme . de Restaud's drawing-room had provided him with a standard of comparison . At half-past four the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was visible . Five minutes earlier she would not have received her cousin , but Eugene knew nothing of the recognized routine of various houses in Paris . He was conducted up the wide , white-painted , crimson-carpeted staircase , between the gilded balusters and masses of flowering plants , to Mme . de Beauseant's apartments . He did not know the rumor current about Mme . de Beauseant , one of the biographies told , with variations , in whispers , every evening in the salons of Paris . For three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with that of one of the most wealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles , the Marquis d ' Ajuda-Pinto . It was one of those innocent _liaisons_ which possess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that they find the presence of a third person intolerable . The Vicomte de Beauseant , therefore , had himself set an example to the rest of the world by respecting , with as good a grace as might be , this morganatic union . Any one who came to call on the Vicomtesse in the early days of this friendship was sure to find the Marquis d ' Ajuda-Pinto there . As , under the circumstances , Mme . de Beauseant could not very well shut her door against these visitors , she gave them such a cold reception , and showed so much interest in the study of the ceiling , that no one could fail to understand how much he bored her ; and when it became known in Paris that Mme . de Beauseant was bored by callers between two and four o ' clock , she was left in perfect solitude during that interval . She went to the Bouffons or to the Opera with M. de Beauseant and M. d ' Ajuda-Pinto ; and M. de Beauseant , like a well-bred man of the world , always left his wife and the Portuguese as soon as he had installed them . But M. d ' Ajuda-Pinto must marry , and a Mlle . de Rochefide was the young lady . In the whole fashionable world there was but one person who as yet knew nothing of the arrangement , and that was Mme . de Beauseant . Some of her friends had hinted at the possibility , and she had laughed at them , believing that envy had prompted those ladies to try to make mischief . And now , though the bans were about to be published , and although the handsome Portuguese had come that day to break the news to the Vicomtesse , he had not found courage as yet to say one word about his treachery . How was it ? Nothing is doubtless more difficult than the notification of an ultimatum of this kind . There are men who feel more at their ease when they stand up before another man who threatens their lives with sword or pistol than in the presence of a woman who , after two hours of lamentations and reproaches , falls into a dead swoon and requires salts . At this moment , therefore , M. d ' Ajuda-Pinto was on thorns , and anxious to take his leave . He told himself that in some way or other the news would reach Mme . de Beauseant ; he would write , it would be much better to do it by letter , and not to utter the words that should stab her to the heart . So when the servant announced M. Eugene de Rastignac , the Marquis d ' Ajuda-Pinto trembled with joy . To be sure , a loving woman shows even more ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in varying the monotony of his happiness ; and when she is about to be forsaken , she instinctively interprets every gesture as rapidly as Virgil's courser detected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze . It was impossible , therefore , that Mme . de Beauseant should not detect that involuntary thrill of satisfaction ; slight though it was , it was appalling in its artlessness . Eugene had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in any house without first making himself acquainted with the whole history of its owner , and of its owner's wife and family , so that he may avoid making any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw forth the picturesque exclamation , "" Harness five bullocks to your cart ! "" probably because you will need them all to pull you out of the quagmire into which a false step has plunged you . If , down to the present day , our language has no name for these conversational disasters , it is probably because they are believed to be impossible , the publicity given in Paris to every scandal is so prodigious . After the awkward incident at Mme . de Restaud's , no one but Eugene could have reappeared in his character of bullock-driver in Mme . de Beauseant's drawing-room . But if Mme . de Restaud and M. de Trailles had found him horribly in the way , M. d ' Ajuda hailed his coming with relief . "" Good-bye , "" said the Portuguese , hurrying to the door , as Eugene made his entrance into a dainty little pink-and-gray drawing-room , where luxury seemed nothing more than good taste . "" Until this evening , "" said Mme . de Beauseant , turning her head to give the Marquis a glance . "" We are going to the Bouffons , are we not ? "" "" I can not go , "" he said , with his fingers on the door handle . Mme . de Beauseant rose and beckoned to him to return . She did not pay the slightest attention to Eugene , who stood there dazzled by the sparkling marvels around him ; he began to think that this was some story out of the Arabian Nights made real , and did not know where to hide himself , when the woman before him seemed to be unconscious of his existence . The Vicomtesse had raised the forefinger of her right hand , and gracefully signed to the Marquis to seat himself beside her . The Marquis felt the imperious sway of passion in her gesture ; he came back towards her . Eugene watched him , not without a feeling of envy . "" That is the owner of the brougham ! "" he said to himself . "" But is it necessary to have a pair of spirited horses , servants in livery , and torrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris ? "" The demon of luxury gnawed at his heart , greed burned in his veins , his throat was parched with the thirst of gold . He had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter . His father , mother , brothers , sisters , and aunt did not spend two hundred francs a month among them . This swift comparison between his present condition and the aims he had in view helped to benumb his faculties . "" Why not ? "" the Vicomtesse was saying , as she smiled at the Portuguese . "" Why can not you come to the Italiens ? "" "" Affairs ! I am to dine with the English Ambassador . "" "" Throw him over . "" When a man once enters on a course of deception , he is compelled to add lie to lie . M. d ' Ajuda therefore said , smiling , "" Do you lay your commands on me ? "" "" Yes , certainly . "" "" That was what I wanted to have you say to me , "" he answered , dissembling his feelings in a glance which would have reassured any other woman . He took the Vicomtesse's hand , kissed it , and went . Eugene ran his fingers through his hair , and constrained himself to bow . He thought that now Mme . de Beauseant would give him her attention ; but suddenly she sprang forward , rushed to a window in the gallery , and watched M. d ' Ajuda step into his carriage ; she listened to the order that he gave , and heard the Swiss repeat it to the coachman : "" To M. de Rochefide's house . "" Those words , and the way in which M. d ' Ajuda flung himself back in the carriage , were like a lightning flash and a thunderbolt for her ; she walked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart . The most terrible catastrophes only happen among the heights . The Vicomtesse went to her own room , sat down at a table , and took up a sheet of dainty notepaper . "" When , instead of dining with the English Ambassador , "" she wrote , "" you go to the Rochefides , you owe me an explanation , which I am waiting to hear . "" She retraced several of the letters , for her hand was trembling so that they were indistinct ; then she signed the note with an initial C for "" Claire de Bourgogne , "" and rang the bell . "" Jacques , "" she said to the servant , who appeared immediately , "" take this note to M. de Rochefide's house at half-past seven and ask for the Marquis d ' Ajuda . If M. d ' Ajuda is there , leave the note without waiting for an answer ; if he is not there , bring the note back to me . "" "" Madame la Vicomtess , there is a visitor in the drawing-room . "" "" Ah ! yes , of course , "" she said , opening the door . Eugene was beginning to feel very uncomfortable , but at last the Vicomtesse appeared ; she spoke to him , and the tremulous tones of her voice vibrated through his heart . "" Pardon me , monsieur , "" she said ; "" I had a letter to write . Now I am quite at liberty . "" She scarcely knew what she was saying , for even as she spoke she thought , "" Ah ! he means to marry Mlle . de Rochefide ? But is he still free ? This evening the marriage shall be broken off , or else ... But before to-morrow I shall know . "" "" Cousin ... "" the student replied . "" Eh ? "" said the Countess , with an insolent glance that sent a cold shudder through Eugene ; he understood what that "" Eh ? "" meant ; he had learned a great deal in three hours , and his wits were on the alert . He reddened : "" Madame ... "" he began ; he hesitated a moment , and then went on . "" Pardon me ; I am in such need of protection that the nearest scrap of relationship could do me no harm . "" Mme . de Beauseant smiled but there was sadness in her smile ; even now she felt forebodings of the coming pain , the air she breathed was heavy with the storm that was about to burst . "" If you knew how my family are situated , "" he went on , "" you would love to play the part of a beneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears the obstacles from the path of her protege . "" "" Well , cousin , "" she said , laughing , "" and how can I be of service to you ? "" "" But do I know even that ? I am distantly related to you , and this obscure and remote relationship is even now a perfect godsend to me . You have confused my ideas ; I can not remember the things that I meant to say to you . I know no one else here in Paris .... Ah ! if I could only ask you to counsel me , ask you to look upon me as a poor child who would fain cling to the hem of your dress , who would lay down his life for you . "" "" Would you kill a man for me ? "" "" Two , "" said Eugene . "" You , child . Yes , you are a child , "" she said , keeping back the tears that came to her eyes ; "" you would love sincerely . "" "" Oh ! "" he cried , flinging up his head . The audacity of the student's answer interested the Vicomtesse in him . The southern brain was beginning to scheme for the first time . Between Mme . de Restaud's blue boudoir and Mme . de Beauseant's rose-colored drawing-room he had made a three years' advance in a kind of law which is not a recognized study in Paris , although it is a sort of higher jurisprudence , and , when well understood , is a highroad to success of every kind . "" Ah ! that is what I meant to say ! "" said Eugene . "" I met Mme . de Restaud at your ball , and this morning I went to see her . "" You must have been very much in the way , "" said Mme . de Beauseant , smiling as she spoke . "" Yes , indeed . I am a novice , and my blunders will set every one against me , if you do not give me your counsel . I believe that in Paris it is very difficult to meet with a young , beautiful , and wealthy woman of fashion who would be willing to teach me , what you women can explain so well--life . I shall find a M. de Trailles everywhere . So I have come to you to ask you to give me a key to a puzzle , to entreat you to tell me what sort of blunder I made this morning . I mentioned an old man ---- "" "" Madame la Duchess de Langeais , "" Jacques cut the student short ; Eugene gave expression to his intense annoyance by a gesture . "" If you mean to succeed , "" said the Vicomtesse in a low voice , "" in the first place you must not be so demonstrative . "" "" Ah ! good morning , dear , "" she continued , and rising and crossing the room , she grasped the Duchess' hands as affectionately as if they had been sisters ; the Duchess responded in the prettiest and most gracious way . "" Two intimate friends ! "" said Rastignac to himself . "" Henceforward I shall have two protectresses ; those two women are great friends , no doubt , and this newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her friend's cousin . "" "" To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune , dear Antoinette ? "" asked Mme . de Beauseant . "" Well , I saw M. d ' Ajuda-Pinto at M. de Rochefide's door , so I thought that if I came I should find you alone . "" Mme . de Beauseant's mouth did not tighten , her color did not rise , her expression did not alter , or rather , her brow seemed to clear as the Duchess uttered those deadly words . "" If I had known that you were engaged ---- "" the speaker added , glancing at Eugene . "" This gentleman is M. Eugene de Rastignac , one of my cousins , "" said the Vicomtesse . "" Have you any news of General de Montriveau ? "" she continued . "" Serizy told me yesterday that he never goes anywhere now ; has he been to see you to-day ? "" It was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with M. de Montriveau , and that he was a faithless lover ; she felt the question in her very heart , and her face flushed as she answered : "" He was at the Elysee yesterday . "" "" In attendance ? "" "" Claire , "" returned the Duchess , and hatred overflowed in the glances she threw at Mme . de Beauseant ; "" of course you know that M. d ' Ajuda-Pinto is going to marry Mlle . de Rochefide ; the bans will be published to-morrow . "" This thrust was too cruel ; the Vicomtesse's face grew white , but she answered , laughing , "" One of those rumors that fools amuse themselves with . What should induce M. d ' Ajuda to take one of the noblest names in Portugal to the Rochefides ? The Rochefides were only ennobled yesterday . "" "" But Bertha will have two hundred thousand livres a year , they say . "" "" M. d ' Ajuda is too wealthy to marry for money . "" "" But , my dear , Mlle . de Rochefide is a charming girl . "" "" Indeed ? "" "" And , as a matter of fact , he is dining with them to-day ; the thing is settled . It is very surprising to me that you should know so little about it . "" Mme . de Beauseant turned to Rastignac . "" What was the blunder that you made , monsieur ? "" she asked . "" The poor boy is only just launched into the world , Antoinette , so that he understands nothing of all this that we are speaking of . Be merciful to him , and let us finish our talk to-morrow . Everything will be announced to-morrow , you know , and your kind informal communication can be accompanied by official confirmation . "" The Duchess gave Eugene one of those insolent glances that measure a man from head to foot , and leave him crushed and annihilated . "" Madame , I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into Mme . de Restaud's heart ; unwittingly--therein lies my offence , "" said the student of law , whose keen brain had served him sufficiently well , for he had detected the biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk . "" You continue to receive , possibly you fear , those who know the amount of pain that they deliberately inflict ; but a clumsy blunderer who has no idea how deeply he wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not know how to make use of his opportunities , and every one despises him . "" Mme . de Beauseant gave the student a glance , one of those glances in which a great soul can mingle dignity and gratitude . It was like balm to the law student , who was still smarting under the Duchess' insolent scrutiny ; she had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some article to appraise its value . "" Imagine , too , that I had just made some progress with the Comte de Restaud ; for I should tell you , madame , "" he went on , turning to the Duchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner , "" that as yet I am only a poor devil of a student , very much alone in the world , and very poor ---- "" "" You should not tell us that , M. de Rastignac . We women never care about anything that no one else will take . "" "" Bah ! "" said Eugene . "" I am only two-and-twenty , and I must make up my mind to the drawbacks of my time of life . Besides , I am confessing my sins , and it would be impossible to kneel in a more charming confessional ; you commit your sins in one drawing-room , and receive absolution for them in another . "" The Duchess' expression grew colder , she did not like the flippant tone of these remarks , and showed that she considered them to be in bad taste by turning to the Vicomtesse with -- "" This gentleman has only just come ---- "" Mme . de Beauseant began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the Duchess both . "" He has only just come to Paris , dear , and is in search of some one who will give him lessons in good taste . "" "" Mme . la Duchesse , "" said Eugene , "" is it not natural to wish to be initiated into the mysteries which charm us ? "" ( "" Come , now , "" he said to himself , "" my language is superfinely elegant , I 'm sure . "" ) "" But Mme . de Restaud is herself , I believe , M. de Trailles' pupil , "" said the Duchess . "" Of that I had no idea , madame , "" answered the law student , "" so I rashly came between them . In fact , I got on very well with the lady's husband , and his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my head to tell them that I knew some one of whom I had just caught a glimpse as he went out by a back staircase , a man who had given the Countess a kiss at the end of a passage . "" "" Who was it ? "" both women asked together . "" An old man who lives at the rate of two louis a month in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau , where I , a poor student , lodge likewise . He is a truly unfortunate creature , everybody laughs at him--we all call him ' Father Goriot . ' "" "" Why , child that you are , "" cried the Vicomtesse , "" Mme . de Restaud was a Mlle . Goriot ! "" "" The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer , "" the Duchess added ; "" and when the little creature went to Court , the daughter of a pastry-cook was presented on the same day . Do you remember , Claire ? The King began to laugh , and made some joke in Latin about flour . People--what was it ? -- people ---- "" "" _Ejusdem farinoe_ , "" said Eugene . "" Yes , that was it , "" said the Duchess . "" Oh ! is that her father ? "" the law student continued , aghast . "" Yes , certainly ; the old man had two daughters ; he dotes on them , so to speak , though they will scarcely acknowledge him . "" "" Did n't the second daughter marry a banker with a German name ? "" the Vicomtesse asked , turning to Mme . de Langeais , "" a Baron de Nucingen ? And her name is Delphine , is it not ? Is n't she a fair-haired woman who has a side-box at the Opera ? She comes sometimes to the Bouffons , and laughs loudly to attract attention . "" The Duchess smiled and said : "" I wonder at you , dear . Why do you take so much interest in people of that kind ? One must have been as madly in love as Restaud was , to be infatuated with Mlle . Anastasie and her flour sacks . Oh ! he will not find her a good bargain ! She is in M. de Trailles' hands , and he will ruin her . "" "" And they do not acknowledge their father ! "" Eugene repeated . "" Oh ! well , yes , their father , the father , a father , "" replied the Vicomtesse , "" a kind father who gave them each five or six hundred thousand francs , it is said , to secure their happiness by marrying them well ; while he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for himself , thinking that his daughters would always be his daughters , thinking that in them he would live his life twice over again , that in their houses he should find two homes , where he would be loved and looked up to , and made much of . And in two years' time both his sons-in-law had turned him out of their houses as if he were one of the lowest outcasts . "" Tears came into Eugene's eyes . He was still under the spell of youthful beliefs , he had just left home , pure and sacred feelings had been stirred within him , and this was his first day on the battlefield of civilization in Paris . Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a moment the three looked at each other in silence . "" _Eh , mon Dieu ! _ "" said Mme . de Langeais ; "" yes , it seems very horrible , and yet we see such things every day . Is there not a reason for it ? Tell me , dear , have you ever really thought what a son-in-law is ? A son-in-law is the man for whom we bring up , you and I , a dear little one , bound to us very closely in innumerable ways ; for seventeen years she will be the joy of her family , its ' white soul , ' as Lamartine says , and suddenly she will become its scourge . When HE comes and takes her from us , his love from the very beginning is like an axe laid to the root of all the old affection in our darling's heart , and all the ties that bound her to her family are severed . But yesterday our little daughter thought of no one but her mother and father , as we had no thought that was not for her ; by to-morrow she will have become a hostile stranger . The tragedy is always going on under our eyes . On the one hand you see a father who has sacrificed himself to his son , and his daughter-in-law shows him the last degree of insolence . On the other hand , it is the son-in-law who turns his wife's mother out of the house . I sometimes hear it said that there is nothing dramatic about society in these days ; but the Drama of the Son-in-law is appalling , to say nothing of our marriages , which have come to be very poor farces . I can explain how it all came about in the old vermicelli maker's case . I think I recollect that Foriot ---- "" "" Goriot , madame . "" "" Yes , that Moriot was once President of his Section during the Revolution . He was in the secret of the famous scarcity of grain , and laid the foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for ten times its cost . He had as much flour as he wanted . My grandmother's steward sold him immense quantities . No doubt Noriot shared the plunder with the Committee of Public Salvation , as that sort of person always did . I recollect the steward telling my grandmother that she might live at Grandvilliers in complete security , because her corn was as good as a certificate of civism . Well , then , this Loriot , who sold corn to those butchers , has never had but one passion , they say--he idolizes his daughters . He settled one of them under Restaud's roof , and grafted the other into the Nucingen family tree , the Baron de Nucingen being a rich banker who had turned Royalist . You can quite understand that so long as Bonaparte was Emperor , the two sons-in-law could manage to put up with the old Ninety-three ; but after the restoration of the Bourbons , M. de Restaud felt bored by the old man's society , and the banker was still more tired of it . His daughters were still fond of him ; they wanted ' to keep the goat and the cabbage , ' so they used to see Joriot whenever there was no one there , under pretence of affection . ' Come to-day , papa , we shall have you all to ourselves , and that will be much nicer ! ' and all that sort of thing . As for me , dear , I believe that love has second-sight : poor Ninety-three ; his heart must have bled . He saw that his daughters were ashamed of him , that if they loved their husbands his visits must make mischief . So he immolated himself . He made the sacrifice because he was a father ; he went into voluntary exile . His daughters were satisfied , so he thought that he had done the best thing he could ; but it was a family crime , and father and daughters were accomplices . You see this sort of thing everywhere . What could this old Doriot have been but a splash of mud in his daughters' drawing-rooms ? He would only have been in the way , and bored other people , besides being bored himself . And this that happened between father and daughters may happen to the prettiest woman in Paris and the man she loves the best ; if her love grows tiresome , he will go ; he will descend to the basest trickery to leave her . It is the same with all love and friendship . Our heart is a treasury ; if you pour out all its wealth at once , you are bankrupt . We show no more mercy to the affection that reveals its utmost extent than we do to another kind of prodigal who has not a penny left . Their father had given them all he had . For twenty years he had given his whole heart to them ; then , one day , he gave them all his fortune too . The lemon was squeezed ; the girls left the rest in the gutter . "" "" The world is very base , "" said the Vicomtesse , plucking at the threads of her shawl . She did not raise her head as she spoke ; the words that Mme . de Langeais had meant for her in the course of her story had cut her to the quick . "" Base ? Oh , no , "" answered the Duchess ; "" the world goes its own way , that is all . If I speak in this way , it is only to show that I am not duped by it . I think as you do , "" she said , pressing the Vicomtesse's hand . "" The world is a slough ; let us try to live on the heights above it . "" She rose to her feet and kissed Mme . de Beauseant on the forehead as she said : "" You look very charming to-day , dear . I have never seen such a lovely color in your cheeks before . "" Then she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin . "" Father Goriot is sublime ! "" said Eugene to himself , as he remembered how he had watched his neighbor work the silver vessel into a shapeless mass that night . Mme . de Beauseant did not hear him ; she was absorbed in her own thoughts . For several minutes the silence remained unbroken till the law student became almost paralyzed with embarrassment , and was equally afraid to go or stay or speak a word . "" The world is basely ungrateful and ill-natured , "" said the Vicomtesse at last . "" No sooner does a trouble befall you than a friend is ready to bring the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a dagger while calling on you to admire the handle . Epigrams and sarcasms already ! Ah ! I will defend myself ! "" She raised her head like the great lady that she was , and lightnings flashed from her proud eyes . "" Ah ! "" she said , as she saw Eugene , "" are you there ? "" "" Still , "" he said piteously . "" Well , then , M. de Rastignac , deal with the world as it deserves . You are determined to succeed ? I will help you . You shall sound the depths of corruption in woman ; you shall measure the extent of man's pitiful vanity . Deeply as I am versed in such learning , there were pages in the book of life that I had not read . Now I know all . The more cold-blooded your calculations , the further you will go . Strike ruthlessly ; you will be feared . Men and women for you must be nothing more than post-horses ; take a fresh relay , and leave the last to drop by the roadside ; in this way you will reach the goal of your ambition . You will be nothing here , you see , unless a woman interests herself in you ; and she must be young and wealthy , and a woman of the world . Yet , if you have a heart , lock it carefully away like a treasure ; do not let any one suspect it , or you will be lost ; you would cease to be the executioner , you would take the victim's place . And if ever you should love , never let your secret escape you ! Trust no one until you are very sure of the heart to which you open your heart . Learn to mistrust every one ; take every precaution for the sake of the love which does not exist as yet . Listen , Miguel "" -- the name slipped from her so naturally that she did not notice her mistake -- "" there is something still more appalling than the ingratitude of daughters who have cast off their old father and wish that he were dead , and that is a rivalry between two sisters . Restaud comes of a good family , his wife has been received into their circle ; she has been presented at court ; and her sister , her wealthy sister , Mme . Delphine de Nucingen , the wife of a great capitalist , is consumed with envy , and ready to die of spleen . There is gulf set between the sisters--indeed , they are sisters no longer--the two women who refuse to acknowledge their father do not acknowledge each other . So Mme . de Nucingen would lap up all the mud that lies between the Rue Saint-Lazare and the Rue de Grenelle to gain admittance to my salon . She fancied that she should gain her end through de Marsay ; she has made herself de Marsay's slave , and she bores him . De Marsay cares very little about her . If you will introduce her to me , you will be her darling , her Benjamin ; she will idolize you . If , after that , you can love her , do so ; if not , make her useful . I will ask her to come once or twice to one of my great crushes , but I will never receive her here in the morning . I will bow to her when I see her , and that will be quite sufficient . You have shut the Comtesse de Restaud's door against you by mentioning Father Goriot's name . Yes , my good friend , you may call at her house twenty times , and every time out of the twenty you will find that she is not at home . The servants have their orders , and will not admit you . Very well , then , now let Father Goriot gain the right of entry into her sister's house for you . The beautiful Mme . de Nucingen will give the signal for a battle . As soon as she singles you out , other women will begin to lose their heads about you , and her enemies and rivals and intimate friends will all try to take you from her . There are women who will fall in love with a man because another woman has chosen him ; like the city madams , poor things , who copy our millinery , and hope thereby to acquire our manners . You will have a success , and in Paris success is everything ; it is the key of power . If the women credit you with wit and talent , the men will follow suit so long as you do not undeceive them yourself . There will be nothing you may not aspire to ; you will go everywhere , and you will find out what the world is--an assemblage of fools and knaves . But you must be neither the one nor the other . I am giving you my name like Ariadne's clue of thread to take with you into the labyrinth ; make no unworthy use of it , "" she said , with a queenly glance and curve of her throat ; "" give it back to me unsullied . And now , go ; leave me . We women also have our battles to fight . "" "" And if you should ever need some one who would gladly set a match to a train for you ---- "" "" Well ? "" she asked . He tapped his heart , smiled in answer to his cousin's smile , and went . It was five o ' clock , and Eugene was hungry ; he was afraid lest he should not be in time for dinner , a misgiving which made him feel that it was pleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris . This sensation of physical comfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that assailed him . A mortification usually sends a young man of his age into a furious rage ; he shakes his fist at society , and vows vengeance when his belief in himself is shaken . Just then Rastignac was overwhelmed by the words , "" You have shut the Countess' door against you . "" "" I shall call ! "" he said to himself , "" and if Mme . de Beauseant is right , if I never find her at home -- I. .. well , Mme . de Restaud shall meet me in every salon in Paris . I will learn to fence and have some pistol practice , and kill that Maxime of hers ! "" "" And money ? "" cried an inward monitor . "" How about money , where is that to come from ? "" And all at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de Restaud's drawing-room rose before his eyes . That was the luxury which Goriot's daughter had loved too well , the gilding , the ostentatious splendor , the unintelligent luxury of the parvenu , the riotous extravagance of a courtesan . Then the attractive vision suddenly went under an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hotel de Beauseant . As his fancy wandered among these lofty regions in the great world of Paris , innumerable dark thoughts gathered in his heart ; his ideas widened , and his conscience grew more elastic . He saw the world as it is ; saw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law and public opinion , and found in success the _ultima ratio mundi_ . "" Vautrin is right , success is virtue ! "" he said to himself . Arrived in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve , he rushed up to his room for ten francs wherewith to satisfy the demands of the cabman , and went in to dinner . He glanced round the squalid room , saw the eighteen poverty-stricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls , and the sight filled him with loathing . The transition was too sudden , and the contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a powerful stimulant ; his ambition developed and grew beyond all social bounds . On the one hand , he beheld a vision of social life in its most charming and refined forms , of quick-pulsed youth , of fair , impassioned faces invested with all the charm of poetry , framed in a marvelous setting of luxury or art ; and , on the other hand , he saw a sombre picture , the miry verge beyond these faces , in which passion was extinct and nothing was left of the drama but the cords and pulleys and bare mechanism . Mme . de Beauseant's counsels , the words uttered in anger by the forsaken lady , her petulant offer , came to his mind , and poverty was a ready expositor . Rastignac determined to open two parallel trenches so as to insure success ; he would be a learned doctor of law and a man of fashion . Clearly he was still a child ! Those two lines are asymptotes , and will never meet . "" You are very dull , my lord Marquis , "" said Vautrin , with one of the shrewd glances that seem to read the innermost secrets of another mind . "" I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me ' my lord Marquis , ' "" answered Eugene . "" A marquis here in Paris , if he is not the veriest sham , ought to have a hundred thousand livres a year at least ; and a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortune's favorite . "" Vautrin's glance at Rastignac was half-paternal , half-contemptuous . "" Puppy ! "" it seemed to say ; "" I should make one mouthful of him ! "" Then he answered : "" You are in a bad humor ; perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse de Restaud was not a success . "" "" She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father dined at our table , "" cried Rastignac . Glances were exchanged all round the room ; Father Goriot looked down . "" You have sent some snuff into my eye , "" he said to his neighbor , turning a little aside to rub his hand over his face . "" Any one who molests Father Goriot will have henceforward to reckon with me , "" said Eugene , looking at the old man's neighbor ; "" he is worth all the rest of us put together . -- I am not speaking of the ladies , "" he added , turning in the direction of Mlle . Taillefer . Eugene's remarks produced a sensation , and his tone silenced the dinner-table . Vautrin alone spoke . "" If you are going to champion Father Goriot , and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain , you had need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils , "" he said , banteringly . "" So I intend , "" said Eugene . "" Then you are taking the field to-day ? "" "" Perhaps , "" Rastignac answered . "" But I owe no account of myself to any one , especially as I do not try to find out what other people do of a night . "" Vautrin looked askance at Rastignac . "" If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets , my boy , you must go behind and see the whole show , and not peep through holes in the curtain . That is enough , "" he added , seeing that Eugene was about to fly into a passion . "" We can have a little talk whenever you like . "" There was a general feeling of gloom and constraint . Father Goriot was so deeply dejected by the student's remark that he did not notice the change in the disposition of his fellow-lodgers , nor know that he had met with a champion capable of putting an end to the persecution . "" Then , M. Goriot sitting there is the father of a countess , "" said Mme . Vauquer in a low voice . "" And of a baroness , "" answered Rastignac . "" That is about all he is capable of , "" said Bianchon to Rastignac ; "" I have taken a look at his head ; there is only one bump--the bump of Paternity ; he must be an _eternal father_ . "" Eugene was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Bianchon's joke . He determined to profit by Mme . de Beauseant's counsels , and was asking himself how he could obtain the necessary money . He grew grave . The wide savannas of the world stretched before his eyes ; all things lay before him , nothing was his . Dinner came to an end , the others went , and he was left in the dining-room . "" So you have seen my daughter ? "" Goriot spoke tremulously , and the sound of his voice broke in upon Eugene's dreams . The young man took the elder's hand , and looked at him with something like kindness in his eyes . "" You are a good and noble man , "" he said . "" We will have some talk about your daughters by and by . "" He rose without waiting for Goriot's answer , and went to his room . There he wrote the following letter to his mother : -- "" My Dear Mother , -- Can you nourish your child from your breast again ? I am in a position to make a rapid fortune , but I want twelve hundred francs--I must have them at all costs . Say nothing about this to my father ; perhaps he might make objections , and unless I have the money , I may be led to put an end to myself , and so escape the clutches of despair . I will tell you everything when I see you . I will not begin to try to describe my present situation ; it would take volumes to put the whole story clearly and fully . I have not been gambling , my kind mother , I owe no one a penny ; but if you would preserve the life that you gave me , you must send me the sum I mention . As a matter of fact , I go to see the Vicomtesse de Beauseant ; she is using her influence for me ; I am obliged to go into society , and I have not a penny to lay out on clean gloves . I can manage to exist on bread and water , or go without food , if need be , but I can not do without the tools with which they cultivate the vineyards in this country . I must resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way , or stick in the mire for the rest of my days . I know that all your hopes are set on me , and I want to realize them quickly . Sell some of your old jewelry , my kind mother ; I will give you other jewels very soon . I know enough of our affairs at home to know all that such a sacrifice means , and you must not think that I would lightly ask you to make it ; I should be a monster if I could . You must think of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by imperative necessity . Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my first campaign , for life in Paris is one continual battle . If you can not otherwise procure the whole of the money , and are forced to sell our aunt's lace , tell her that I will send her some still handsomer , "" and so forth . He wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savings--would they despoil themselves for him , and keep the sacrifice a secret from the family ? To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond gladly , and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the chord of honor that vibrates so loudly in young and high-strung natures . Yet when he had written the letters , he could not help feeling misgivings in spite of his youthful ambition ; his heart beat fast , and he trembled . He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away in the lonely manor house ; he knew what trouble and what joy his request would cause his sisters , and how happy they would be as they talked at the bottom of the orchard of that dear brother of theirs in Paris . Visions rose before his eyes ; a sudden strong light revealed his sisters secretly counting over their little store , devising some girlish stratagem by which the money could be sent to him _incognito_ , essaying , for the first time in their lives , a piece of deceit that reached the sublime in its unselfishness . "" A sister's heart is a diamond for purity , a deep sea of tenderness ! "" he said to himself . He felt ashamed of those letters . What power there must be in the petitions put up by such hearts ; how pure the fervor that bears their souls to Heaven in prayer ! What exquisite joy they would find in self-sacrifice ! What a pang for his mother's heart if she could not send him all that he asked for ! And this noble affection , these sacrifices made at such terrible cost , were to serve as the ladder by which he meant to climb to Delphine de Nucingen . A few tears , like the last grains of incense flung upon the sacred alter fire of the hearth , fell from his eyes . He walked up and down , and despair mingled with his emotion . Father Goriot saw him through the half-open door . "" What is the matter , sir ? "" he asked from the threshold . "" Ah ! my good neighbor , I am as much a son and brother as you are a father . You do well to fear for the Comtesse Anastasie ; there is one M. Maxime de Trailles , who will be her ruin . "" Father Goriot withdrew , stammering some words , but Eugene failed to catch their meaning . The next morning Rastignac went out to post his letters . Up to the last moment he wavered and doubted , but he ended by flinging them into the box . "" I shall succeed ! "" he said to himself . So says the gambler ; so says the great captain ; but the three words that have been the salvation of some few , have been the ruin of many more . A few days after this Eugene called at Mme . de Restaud's house ; she was not at home . Three times he tried the experiment , and three times he found her doors closed against him , though he was careful to choose an hour when M. de Trailles was not there . The Vicomtesse was right . The student studied no longer . He put in an appearance at lectures simply to answer to his name , and after thus attesting his presence , departed forthwith . He had been through a reasoning process familiar to most students . He had seen the advisability of deferring his studies to the last moment before going up for his examinations ; he made up his mind to cram his second and third years' work into the third year , when he meant to begin to work in earnest , and to complete his studies in law with one great effort . In the meantime he had fifteen months in which to navigate the ocean of Paris , to spread the nets and set the lines that would bring him a protectress and a fortune . Twice during that week he saw Mme . de Beauseant ; he did not go to her house until he had seen the Marquis d ' Ajuda drive away . Victory for yet a few more days was with the great lady , the most poetic figure in the Faubourg Saint-Germain ; and the marriage of the Marquis d ' Ajuda-Pinto with Mlle . de Rochefide was postponed . The dread of losing her happiness filled those days with a fever of joy unknown before , but the end was only so much the nearer . The Marquis d ' Ajuda and the Rochefides agreed that this quarrel and reconciliation was a very fortunate thing ; Mme . de Beauseant ( so they hoped ) would gradually become reconciled to the idea of the marriage , and in the end would be brought to sacrifice d ' Ajuda's morning visits to the exigencies of a man's career , exigencies which she must have foreseen . In spite of the most solemn promises , daily renewed , M. d ' Ajuda was playing a part , and the Vicomtesse was eager to be deceived . "" Instead of taking a leap heroically from the window , she is falling headlong down the staircase , "" said her most intimate friend , the Duchesse de Langeais . Yet this after-glow of happiness lasted long enough for the Vicomtesse to be of service to her young cousin . She had a half-superstitious affection for him . Eugene had shown her sympathy and devotion at a crisis when a woman sees no pity , no real comfort in any eyes ; when if a man is ready with soothing flatteries , it is because he has an interested motive . Rastignac made up his mind that he must learn the whole of Goriot's previous history ; he would come to his bearings before attempting to board the Maison de Nucingen . The results of his inquiries may be given briefly as follows : -- In the days before the Revolution , Jean-Joachim Goriot was simply a workman in the employ of a vermicelli maker . He was a skilful , thrifty workman , sufficiently enterprising to buy his master's business when the latter fell a chance victim to the disturbances of 1789 . Goriot established himself in the Rue de la Jussienne , close to the Corn Exchange . His plain good sense led him to accept the position of President of the Section , so as to secure for his business the protection of those in power at that dangerous epoch . This prudent step had led to success ; the foundations of his fortune were laid in the time of the Scarcity ( real or artificial ) , when the price of grain of all kinds rose enormously in Paris . People used to fight for bread at the bakers' doors ; while other persons went to the grocers' shops and bought Italian paste foods without brawling over it . It was during this year that Goriot made the money , which , at a later time , was to give him all the advantage of the great capitalist over the small buyer ; he had , moreover , the usual luck of average ability ; his mediocrity was the salvation of him . He excited no one's envy , it was not even suspected that he was rich till the peril of being rich was over , and all his intelligence was concentrated , not on political , but on commercial speculations . Goriot was an authority second to none on all questions relating to corn , flour , and "" middlings "" ; and the production , storage , and quality of grain . He could estimate the yield of the harvest , and foresee market prices ; he bought his cereals in Sicily , and imported Russian wheat . Any one who had heard him hold forth on the regulations that control the importation and exportation of grain , who had seen his grasp of the subject , his clear insight into the principles involved , his appreciation of weak points in the way that the system worked , would have thought that here was the stuff of which a minister is made . Patient , active , and persevering , energetic and prompt in action , he surveyed his business horizon with an eagle eye . Nothing there took him by surprise ; he foresaw all things , knew all that was happening , and kept his own counsel ; he was a diplomatist in his quick comprehension of a situation ; and in the routine of business he was as patient and plodding as a soldier on the march . But beyond this business horizon he could not see . He used to spend his hours of leisure on the threshold of his shop , leaning against the framework of the door . Take him from his dark little counting-house , and he became once more the rough , slow-witted workman , a man who can not understand a piece of reasoning , who is indifferent to all intellectual pleasures , and falls asleep at the play , a Parisian Dolibom in short , against whose stupidity other minds are powerless . Natures of this kind are nearly all alike ; in almost all of them you will find some hidden depth of sublime affection . Two all-absorbing affections filled the vermicelli maker's heart to the exclusion of every other feeling ; into them he seemed to put all the forces of his nature , as he put the whole power of his brain into the corn trade . He had regarded his wife , the only daughter of a rich farmer of La Brie , with a devout admiration ; his love for her had been boundless . Goriot had felt the charm of a lovely and sensitive nature , which , in its delicate strength , was the very opposite of his own . Is there any instinct more deeply implanted in the heart of man than the pride of protection , a protection which is constantly exerted for a fragile and defenceless creature ? Join love thereto , the warmth of gratitude that all generous souls feel for the source of their pleasures , and you have the explanation of many strange incongruities in human nature . After seven years of unclouded happiness , Goriot lost his wife . It was very unfortunate for him . She was beginning to gain an ascendency over him in other ways ; possibly she might have brought that barren soil under cultivation , she might have widened his ideas and given other directions to his thoughts . But when she was dead , the instinct of fatherhood developed in him till it almost became a mania . All the affection balked by death seemed to turn to his daughters , and he found full satisfaction for his heart in loving them . More or less brilliant proposals were made to him from time to time ; wealthy merchants or farmers with daughters vied with each other in offering inducements to him to marry again ; but he determined to remain a widower . His father-in-law , the only man for whom he felt a decided friendship , gave out that Goriot had made a vow to be faithful to his wife's memory . The frequenters of the Corn Exchange , who could not comprehend this sublime piece of folly , joked about it among themselves , and found a ridiculous nickname for him . One of them ventured ( after a glass over a bargain ) to call him by it , and a blow from the vermicelli maker's fist sent him headlong into a gutter in the Rue Oblin . He could think of nothing else when his children were concerned ; his love for them made him fidgety and anxious ; and this was so well known , that one day a competitor , who wished to get rid of him to secure the field to himself , told Goriot that Delphine had just been knocked down by a cab . The vermicelli maker turned ghastly pale , left the Exchange at once , and did not return for several days afterwards ; he was ill in consequence of the shock and the subsequent relief on discovering that it was a false alarm . This time , however , the offender did not escape with a bruised shoulder ; at a critical moment in the man's affairs , Goriot drove him into bankruptcy , and forced him to disappear from the Corn Exchange . As might have been expected , the two girls were spoiled . With an income of sixty thousand francs , Goriot scarcely spent twelve hundred on himself , and found all his happiness in satisfying the whims of the two girls . The best masters were engaged , that Anastasie and Delphine might be endowed with all the accomplishments which distinguish a good education . They had a chaperon--luckily for them , she was a woman who had good sense and good taste ; -- they learned to ride ; they had a carriage for their use ; they lived as the mistress of a rich old lord might live ; they had only to express a wish , their father would hasten to give them their most extravagant desires , and asked nothing of them in return but a kiss . Goriot had raised the two girls to the level of the angels ; and , quite naturally , he himself was left beneath them . Poor man ! he loved them even for the pain that they gave him . When the girls were old enough to be married , they were left free to choose for themselves . Each had half her father's fortune as her dowry ; and when the Comte de Restaud came to woo Anastasie for her beauty , her social aspirations led her to leave her father's house for a more exalted sphere . Delphine wished for money ; she married Nucingen , a banker of German extraction , who became a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire . Goriot remained a vermicelli maker as before . His daughters and his sons-in-law began to demur ; they did not like to see him still engaged in trade , though his whole life was bound up with his business . For five years he stood out against their entreaties , then he yielded , and consented to retire on the amount realized by the sale of his business and the savings of the last few years . It was this capital that Mme . Vauquer , in the early days of his residence with her , had calculated would bring in eight or ten thousand livres in a year . He had taken refuge in her lodging-house , driven there by despair when he knew that his daughters were compelled by their husbands not only to refuse to receive him as an inmate in their houses , but even to see him no more except in private . This was all the information which Rastignac gained from a M. Muret who had purchased Goriot's business , information which confirmed the Duchesse de Langeais' suppositions , and herewith the preliminary explanation of this obscure but terrible Parisian tragedy comes to an end ."

312	As each week passes , Sleaford Town are getting stronger and stronger . The Team put out against Coleby on this balmy September afternoon was more in keeping with the Manager's expectations to see Sleaford Town do very well in the Lincoln league . The game started brightly with Gibson hitting the woodwork after only 6minutes with a fierce drive only for Coleby to force a first class save from Ben Jackson in the Sleaford goal with a looping header after 15 minutes . Sleaford , with Hanlon , Morley , and Musson dictating play , were winning the midfield battle . It was a flowing move through the midfield culminating in Sleaford's bright new signing Reece racing away down the left before setting up Gibson from 25 yds to do what he does best and score with a fine shot into the top corner . The best of Sleaford's defence was in evidence after 44 minutes when after Hill & Greenslade had snuffed out another Coleby attack , Goalkeeper Jackson then quickly threw the ball to Sweeper Fox . Fox then carried the ball 30 yds before delivering a fine ball to Reece who flicked on for Morley to score with his ' Bryan Robson ' style late run from Midfield . 2-0 at half time . Same story after the break with Sleaford looking the stronger team . Costa gave way to young Martin Dickinson , and it was Martin's strong run and magnificent left foot strike that sealed the victory 3-0 after 69 minutes . Ryan McGuinness replaced Mark Brayfield who had played very well in his first start of the season . Ryan once again showed why he is one for the future with great touches and intelligent running . Carl Roberts replaced Hanlon with 8 minutes remaining and the Player Manager had a chance to put the icing on the cake with a forth goal from 6yds only to blaze wildly over ( to an ironic cheer from his prodigies ) All in all a good days work and the signs are good to continue the early success .

That 's a problem with the heart . I learned that it 's not fun when your heart does n't work like it 's supposed to . Then I turned nine .

It was really hard for me when they were figuring everything out . About that time , everyone except my friends teased me and said that I looked fat , I guess because I had always been skinny . I was n't really fat . The medicine that I needed to take made me look that way , that 's all . I was sad , so I asked my mother to come in and talk to the kids about lupus and about what I had been through . She 's a nurse , so she really can help kids to understand things .

This is preserved intact . His mother , Mary Arden , was one of the daughters of Robert Arden , a yeoman farmer of Wilmcote : his father , John Shakespeare , was a glover and wool dealer of good standing who held the office of Bailiff of the Borough in 1568 . From the age of seven to about 14 , he attended Stratford Grammar School receiving an excellent well rounded education . At the age of 18 he married Anne Hathaway , who was seven years his senior and three months pregnant . She was of ' yeoman ' stock - her family owned a farm one mile west of Stratford in Shottery . He endured her until he could stand it no longer and fled to London to become an actor . He then became actor-manager and part-owner in the Blackfriars and afterwards the Globe Theatres . He was a first-rate actor , but it is as a writer of plays that he has achieved lasting world-wide fame . His plays are thought to be the finest ever written in any language . His 37 plays vary in type ; historical romances , light , fantastic comedies , some are tragedies , all including the comical and the farcical . He was a shrewd business man , amassing quite a fortune in his time . He returned to Stratford for his latter years where he died at the age of 52 and now lies at rest in his special grave at Holy Trinity Church .

70	"Chapter 18 The next day he did not leave the house , and , indeed , spent most of the time in his own room , sick with a wild terror of dying , and yet indifferent to life itself . The consciousness of being hunted , snared , tracked down , had begun to dominate him . If the tapestry did but tremble in the wind , he shook . The dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild regrets . When he closed his eyes , he saw again the sailor's face peering through the mist-stained glass , and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart . But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him . Actual life was chaos , but there was something terribly logical in the imagination . It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin . It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood . In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished , nor the good rewarded . Success was given to the strong , failure thrust upon the weak . That was all . Besides , had any stranger been prowling round the house , he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers . Had any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds , the gardeners would have reported it . Yes , it had been merely fancy . Sibyl Vane's brother had not come back to kill him . He had sailed away in his ship to founder in some winter sea . From him , at any rate , he was safe . Why , the man did not know who he was , could not know who he was . The mask of youth had saved him . And yet if it had been merely an illusion , how terrible it was to think that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms , and give them visible form , and make them move before one ! What sort of life would his be if , day and night , shadows of his crime were to peer at him from silent corners , to mock him from secret places , to whisper in his ear as he sat at the feast , to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep ! As the thought crept through his brain , he grew pale with terror , and the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder . Oh ! in what a wild hour of madness he had killed his friend ! How ghastly the mere memory of the scene ! He saw it all again . Each hideous detail came back to him with added horror . Out of the black cave of time , terrible and swathed in scarlet , rose the image of his sin . When Lord Henry came in at six o ' clock , he found him crying as one whose heart will break . It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out . There was something in the clear , pine-scented air of that winter morning that seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life . But it was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused the change . His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm . With subtle and finely wrought temperaments it is always so . Their strong passions must either bruise or bend . They either slay the man , or themselves die . Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on . The loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude . Besides , he had convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror-stricken imagination , and looked back now on his fears with something of pity and not a little of contempt . After breakfast , he walked with the Duchess for an hour in the garden and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party . The crisp frost lay like salt upon the grass . The sky was an inverted cup of blue metal . A thin film of ice bordered the flat , reed-grown lake . At the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey Clouston , the Duchess's brother , jerking two spent cartridges out of his gun . He jumped from the cart , and having told the groom to take the mare home , made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken and rough undergrowth . "" Have you had good sport , Geoffrey ? "" he asked . "" Not very good , Dorian . I think most of the birds have gone to the open . I dare say it will be better after lunch , when we get to new ground . "" Dorian strolled along by his side . The keen aromatic air , the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood , the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time , and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed , fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom . He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness , by the high indifference of joy . Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front of them , with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it forward , started a hare . It bolted for a thicket of alders . Sir Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder , but there was something in the animal's grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray , and he cried out at once , "" Do n't shoot it , Geoffrey . Let it live . "" "" What nonsense , Dorian ! "" laughed his companion , and as the hare bounded into the thicket , he fired . There were two cries heard , the cry of a hare in pain , which is dreadful , the cry of a man in agony , which is worse . "" Good heavens ! I have hit a beater ! "" exclaimed Sir Geoffrey . "" What an ass the man was to get in front of the guns ! Stop shooting there ! "" he called out at the top of his voice . "" A man is hurt . "" The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand . "" Where , sir ? Where is he ? "" he shouted . At the same time , the firing ceased along the line . "" Here , "" answered Sir Geoffrey angrily , hurrying towards the thicket . "" Why on earth do n't you keep your men back ? Spoiled my shooting for the day . "" Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump , brushing the lithe swinging branches aside . In a few moments they emerged , dragging a body after them into the sunlight . He turned away in horror . It seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went . He heard Sir Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead , and the affirmative answer of the keeper . The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with faces . There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of voices . A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the boughs overhead . After a few moments â that were to him , in his perturbed state , like endless hours of pain â he felt a hand laid on his shoulder . He started and looked round . "" Dorian , "" said Lord Henry , "" I had better tell them that the shooting is stopped for to-day . It would not look well to go on . "" "" I wish it were stopped for ever , Harry , "" he answered bitterly . "" The whole thing is hideous and cruel . Is the man ... ? "" He could not finish the sentence . "" I am afraid so , "" rejoined Lord Henry . "" He got the whole charge of shot in his chest . He must have died almost instantaneously . Come ; let us go home . "" They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly fifty yards without speaking . Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and said , with a heavy sigh , "" It is a bad omen , Harry , a very bad omen . "" "" What is ? "" asked Lord Henry . "" Oh ! this accident , I suppose . My dear fellow , it ca n ' t be helped . It was the man's own fault . Why did he get in front of the guns ? Besides , it is nothing to us . It is rather awkward for Geoffrey , of course . It does not do to pepper beaters . It makes people think that one is a wild shot . And Geoffrey is not ; he shoots very straight . But there is no use talking about the matter . "" Dorian shook his head . "" It is a bad omen , Harry . I feel as if something horrible were going to happen to some of us . To myself , perhaps , "" he added , passing his hand over his eyes , with a gesture of pain . The elder man laughed . "" The only horrible thing in the world is ennui , Dorian . That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness . But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner . I must tell them that the subject is to be tabooed . As for omens , there is no such thing as an omen . Destiny does not send us heralds . She is too wise or too cruel for that . Besides , what on earth could happen to you , Dorian ? You have everything in the world that a man can want . There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you . "" "" There is no one with whom I would not change places , Harry . Do n't laugh like that . I am telling you the truth . The wretched peasant who has just died is better off than I am . I have no terror of death . It is the coming of death that terrifies me . Its monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me . Good heavens ! do n't you see a man moving behind the trees there , watching me , waiting for me ? "" Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand was pointing . "" Yes , "" he said , smiling , "" I see the gardener waiting for you . I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the table to-night . How absurdly nervous you are , my dear fellow ! You must come and see my doctor , when we get back to town . "" Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching . The man touched his hat , glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating manner , and then produced a letter , which he handed to his master . "" Her Grace told me to wait for an answer , "" he murmured . Dorian put the letter into his pocket . "" Tell her Grace that I am coming in , "" he said , coldly . The man turned round and went rapidly in the direction of the house . "" How fond women are of doing dangerous things ! "" laughed Lord Henry . "" It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most . A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on . "" "" How fond you are of saying dangerous things , Harry ! In the present instance , you are quite astray . I like the Duchess very much , but I do n't love her . "" "" And the Duchess loves you very much , but she likes you less , so you are excellently matched . "" "" You are talking scandal , Harry , and there is never any basis for scandal . "" "" The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty , "" said Lord Henry , lighting a cigarette . "" You would sacrifice anybody , Harry , for the sake of an epigram . "" "" The world goes to the altar of its own accord , "" was the answer . "" I wish I could love , "" cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in his voice . "" But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the desire . I am too much concentrated on myself . My own personality has become a burden to me . I want to escape , to go away , to forget . It was silly of me to come down here at all . I think I shall send a wire to Harvey to have the yacht got ready . On a yacht one is safe . "" "" Safe from what , Dorian ? You are in some trouble . Why not tell me what it is ? You know I would help you . "" "" I ca n ' t tell you , Harry , "" he answered sadly . "" And I dare say it is only a fancy of mine . This unfortunate accident has upset me . I have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me . "" "" What nonsense ! "" "" I hope it is , but I ca n ' t help feeling it . Ah ! here is the Duchess , looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown . You see we have come back , Duchess . "" "" I have heard all about it , Mr. Gray , "" she answered . "" Poor Geoffrey is terribly upset . And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare . How curious ! "" "" Yes , it was very curious . I do n't know what made me say it . Some whim , I suppose . It looked the loveliest of little live things . But I am sorry they told you about the man . It is a hideous subject . "" "" It is an annoying subject , "" broke in Lord Henry . "" It has no psychological value at all . Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on purpose , how interesting he would be ! I should like to know some one who had committed a real murder . "" "" How horrid of you , Harry ! "" cried the Duchess . "" Is n't it , Mr. Gray ? Harry , Mr. Gray is ill again . He is going to faint . "" Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled . "" It is nothing , Duchess , "" he murmured ; "" my nerves are dreadfully out of order . That is all . I am afraid I walked too far this morning . I did n't hear what Harry said . Was it very bad ? You must tell me some other time . I think I must go and lie down . You will excuse me , wo n ' t you ? "" They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the conservatory on to the terrace . As the glass door closed behind Dorian , Lord Henry turned and looked at the Duchess with his slumberous eyes . "" Are you very much in love with him ? "" he asked . She did not answer for some time , but stood gazing at the landscape . "" I wish I knew , "" she said at last . He shook his head . "" Knowledge would be fatal . It is the uncertainty that charms one . A mist makes things wonderful . "" "" One may lose one's way . "" "" All ways end at the same point , my dear Gladys . "" "" What is that ? "" "" Disillusion . "" "" It was my dÃ©but in life , "" she sighed . "" It came to you crowned . "" "" I am tired of strawberry leaves . "" "" They become you . "" "" Only in public . "" "" You would miss them , "" said Lord Henry . "" I will not part with a petal . "" "" Monmouth has ears . "" "" Old age is dull of hearing . "" "" Has he never been jealous ? "" "" I wish he had been . "" He glanced about as if in search of something . "" What are you looking for ? "" she inquired . "" The button from your foil , "" he answered . "" You have dropped it . "" She laughed . "" I have still the mask . "" "" It makes your eyes lovelier , "" was his reply . She laughed again . Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet fruit . Upstairs , in his own room , Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa , with terror in every tingling fibre of his body . Life had suddenly become too hideous a burden for him to bear . The dreadful death of the unlucky beater , shot in the thicket like a wild animal , had seemed to him to pre-figure death for himself also . He had nearly swooned at what Lord Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting . At five o ' clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to pack his things for the night-express to town , and to have the brougham at the door by eight-thirty . He was determined not to sleep another night at Selby Royal . It was an ill-omened place . Death walked there in the sunlight . The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood . Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry , telling him that he was going up to town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in his absence . As he was putting it into the envelope , a knock came to the door , and his valet informed him that the head-keeper wished to see him . He frowned and bit his lip . "" Send him in , "" he muttered , after some moments' hesitation . As soon as the man entered , Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a drawer and spread it out before him . "" I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this morning , Thornton ? "" he said , taking up a pen . "" Yes , sir , "" answered the gamekeeper . "" Was the poor fellow married ? Had he any people dependent on him ? "" asked Dorian , looking bored . "" If so , I should not like them to be left in want , and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary . "" "" We do n't know who he is , sir . That is what I took the liberty of coming to you about . "" "" Do n't know who he is ? "" said Dorian , listlessly . "" What do you mean ? Was n ' t he one of your men ? "" "" No , sir . Never saw him before . Seems like a sailor , sir . "" The pen dropped from Dorian Gray's hand , and he felt as if his heart had suddenly stopped beating . "" A sailor ? "" he cried out . "" Did you say a sailor ? "" "" Yes , sir . He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor ; tattooed on both arms , and that kind of thing . "" "" Was there anything found on him ? "" said Dorian , leaning forward and looking at the man with startled eyes . "" Anything that would tell his name ? "" "" Some money , sir â not much , and a six-shooter . There was no name of any kind . A decent-looking man , sir , but rough-like . A sort of sailor we think . "" Dorian started to his feet . A terrible hope fluttered past him . He clutched at it madly . "" Where is the body ? "" he exclaimed . "" Quick ! I must see it at once . "" "" It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm , sir . The folk do n't like to have that sort of thing in their houses . They say a corpse brings bad luck . "" "" The Home Farm ! Go there at once and meet me . Tell one of the grooms to bring my horse round . No. Never mind . I 'll go to the stables myself . It will save time . "" In less than a quarter of an hour , Dorian Gray was galloping down the long avenue as hard as he could go . The trees seemed to sweep past him in spectral procession , and wild shadows to fling themselves across his path . Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him . He lashed her across the neck with his crop . She cleft the dusky air like an arrow . The stones flew from her hoofs . At last he reached the Home Farm . Two men were loitering in the yard . He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them . In the farthest stable a light was glimmering . Something seemed to tell him that the body was there , and he hurried to the door and put his hand upon the latch . There he paused for a moment , feeling that he was on the brink of a discovery that would either make or mar his life . Then he thrust the door open and entered . On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers . A spotted handkerchief had been placed over the face . A coarse candle , stuck in a bottle , sputtered beside it . Dorian Gray shuddered . He felt that his could not be the hand to take the handkerchief away , and called out to one of the farm-servants to come to him . "" Take that thing off the face . I wish to see it , "" he said , clutching at the door-post for support . When the farm-servant had done so , he stepped forward . A cry of joy broke from his lips . The man who had been shot in the thicket was James Vane . He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body . As he rode home , his eyes were full of tears , for he knew he was safe ."

1083	"The schedule of a Happiness Engineer working in live chat When I was first hired as Trial Happiness Engineer , I was concerned about the flexibility of live chat . I imagined a live chat operator being chained to their desk all day . But since this is Automattic the pioneers of remote working , how was this possible ? How was it going to work ? Now I work on as a Happiness Engineer on a team that has a primary focus on live chat . Part of what attracted me to Automattic was the schedule flexibility . I 'm happy to say I have a very flexible schedule and I do n't work the typical 9am â 5pm Monday thru Friday schedule . I 'm also anything but tied to my desk . So how does it all work ? Scheduling / Flexibility The following is my own personal schedule , but each Happiness Engineer is different . There is no one-size-fits-all schedule for Happiness Engineers . At Automattic we have a saying that communication is oxygen . Since everyone has a different schedule , part of the oxygen that allows the Happiness team to function is communicating your schedule . Since every Happiness Engineer does this , this allows for us to efficiently schedule coverage for the week . I make my own schedule . It 's flexible in that I pick the days and times that I work , which amount to 40 hrs a week . Out of those 40 hrs my goal is to spend around 25 hrs live chatting . Currently , we sign up for live chat shifts . So I pick the hours I 'd like to live chat . We have a rough estimate about how many Happiness Engineers we need per an hour . Happiness Engineers get to sign up for which hours they 'd like to work . So it 's a balance of working the hours I 'd like but also trying to work hours where we need more coverage . What does a typical day look like ? I consider my "" core "" work to be live chatting . So I spend between 4-5 hrs live chatting each day . I then schedule the rest of my day around my live chat shifts . Around 1 hr answering tickets Then I spend around 30 minutes to an hour catching up on p2 posts & Slack and commenting ( p2 posts are our internal blog system ) . I also try to give myself between 30 minutes -1 hr each day for time to follow up with any live chats , where I need to test something or send them a follow up email . How flexible is Automattic with scheduling ? In my personal opinion , very flexible . I 'm not a morning person . I 've found I need a few days during the week to sleep in or do errands . This keeps me happiest . So on Wednesdays and Fridays , I start work at noon . Yeah , really ... 12pm . I also tend to work Sunday afternoon-evening anyways , preparing for the week . This works out great , because I get to help out with weekend & evening coverage . So on average I work around 4-6 hours every weekend . Here is what my weekly schedule looks like : My Personal Schedule If I need to take off work a bit early one day , I would log in later in the evening or weekend to help with coverage there . I communicate with my team and my team lead about these kind of changes in my schedule often . For example , when I 'm testing changes to my schedule and trying out new hours to see what works best for me and for live chat coverage . I let them know . This communication is healthy and let 's them know when I 'm around in case they need me . I never felt like I had to jump through hoops to get what I personally feel like is my dream schedule . I feel like Automattic trusts me to work the hours that I need to work , and that I find a schedule that keeps me happy , productive , and contributes to my team's goals . While I choose my own schedule , I try to schedule myself for times when I 'm needed the most . The wonderful thing about Automattic is that we truly are a remote company and no matter what time you choose to work - there is always plenty to do Having a company that is so flexible with me and my schedule , I tend to be flexible in return . If I notice that we may need an extra hand in the evenings or weekends , if it 's not a huge inconvenience to me or my schedule , I jump in and help out . This does n't mean that I work "" extra "" hours - I switch out those hours for hours that are well covered and either take a longer lunch to run an errand or leave a bit earlier then usual on another day . I still work around 40hrs a week , with those switches . I spent a good 9 months testing out schedules trying to find what worked best for me , before I settled on the schedule I 've currently working . Being flexible but consistent I 've personally found that the key to my own efficiency was being consistent . I 've spent about a year testing different times of the day that I live chat best at . I 'm best when I chat roughly around the same time each day . I 've also found that I do n't like working in live chat for more then 2 . 5hrs at time . Usually by then I 'm ready for a break and want to step away from the computer for a bit . I 'm most productive when I live chat right before lunch or the end of the day , so I get a nice break after my live chat shift . So on most days from 9am â 11 : 30am and then again from 2 : 30pm â 5 : 00pm works best for my schedule . When I do my best to generally do my "" core work "" during those hours this helps me get more done , since my brain now is hard-wired to know that it is crunch time . For each live chat shift - I stay in one place . I 'm either at home at my desk or at my coworking spot . I try to stay in a place where I can be most effective there since I have fast wifi and a large screen for multiple windows . Although somedays ... when I need a change of scenery I 'll go to a local coffee shop for my live chat session . Of course , this is what works best for me . Each Happiness Engineer is different and prefers a different schedule . Live Chatting : What 's it like ? One of my biggest concerns as Happiness Engineer Trial was Live Chat . I found the idea of it to be very intimidating . What 's live chat actually like though ? Well ... my first few live chats were a little nerve wrecking . After I got over my own fears , I found live chat to be so much fun . It 's my favorite way to support our users - since I 'm able to resolve a users issue in real time . Once you get a good rhythm , I 've found it to be easier to connect with our users via live chat . I 'm able to get to know them ... and the sites that they 're building . Our users are awesome . They 're kind and patient . So getting to chat with them all day is fun ! What kind of questions are you asked in live chat ? There are all different kinds of questions that come in , and you never know what you 're going to get . We get a lot of domain questions . Which is one of my favorite things to troubleshoot now . For example , when it comes to helping a user map a domain they own elsewhere to use with their WordPress.com site by updating name server settings or by helping a user purchase a domain . We also get a lot of questions about getting a theme set up or selecting a theme for their site . Do you have to know the answer to everything ? I can say that I certainly do n't know everything . While I 'm always striving to learn more . Something that 's helped me be successful is focusing on how to search for the answer . Knowing where to look for the answer is more then half the battle for me rather than having the pressure of knowing every single answer . Also for when I ca n't find the answer to a question , we have a Slack channel specifically for those in Live Chat . Since you 're working in live chat with a group of other Happiness Engineers , we 're all in the same Slack channel together and it 's pretty active . It 's one of my favorite channels because the conversation easily shifts between helping each other troubleshoot and small talk . I rely heavily on this channel . So even when I do n't know the answer , someone there usually does . It 's a great resource and helped me feel like I had a safety net for when I first jumped into live chat . So in Summary ... I love my schedule , live chatting , and Automattic . It really is a blast and the cool part is you could join us because we 're hiring . If you have any questions about my schedule or how Happiness Engineers schedule themselves , leave a comment below ! Hi Tish ! This is n't necessarily a schedule question , but as someone who is looking to apply for a Happiness Engineer position , do you have any pointers ? I know it 's absolutely necessary to stand out among the crowd . Any suggestions you have would be wonderful Thank you ! Your article inspired me to go for it and apply at Automattic ! You 've made me super dee duper excited about interviewing for the HE position ! I love that the interview is via Slack ... What a cool concept ! I 'm soooooo excited !! I hope to join you and the rest of the team ... definitely my type of vibe Thanks for this great "" day in the life ! "" Can I ask you how much previous experience you had with wordpresss + HTML / css you had prior to this position ? I am interested in applying to this role but am not sure that my coding skills are up to par ..."	Opinion/Argumentation
407	The most celebrated actor of his day David Garrick was one of the most successful actors of his time . He was very good at playing many different kinds of people on stage . He first became well known in 1741 for acting as Richard III in Shakespeare's play , but he was also good at other more modern roles . As well as being an actor he was also manager of the Drury Lane Theatre in London . He even wrote plays himself . His acting took London by storm New ways of doing things He brought many new techniques to the English theatre . These included introducing a new style of acting and a way of hiding the stage lights so that they did n't obstruct the view from the audience . Peace and Quiet In 1854 Garrick came to live in Hampton to escape his busy London life . The house where he lived is now called ' Garrick's Villa ' . He built a Temple to Shakespeare in his riverside garden .	Information/Explanation

1654	"The Kursaal Congress Centre and Auditorium is a complex comprising several spaces : a great auditorium , many-use halls and exhibition halls . It was designed by Spanish architect Rafael Moneo , and is located in Donostia-San SebastiÃ¡n ( Basque Country , Spain ) . It opened in 1999 . It consists of several spaces , including the 1 , 800-seat concert hall , the Palacio de Congresos-Auditorio Kursaal , and is the home of the biggest film festival in Spain , the San Sebastian International Film Festival , in existence since 1953 . The historic Kursaal casino , next to the river's mouth The Great Kursaal was an elegant palace built in 1921 , incorporating a casino , a restaurant , a cinema theater , complementary rooms and an 859-seat theater , placed in front of the Gros beach , and next to the mouth of the Urumea river , but it was pulled down in 1973 . An empty plot ( later called K Plot ) was freed . The absence of any architectonic structure in such a privileged site for so many years was remarkable . At the time the old palace was pulled down , a competition was held to find a replacement . However , the winning project was never constructed due to its complexity . A new project proposal was submitted in 1972 . After a few changes to the design , building work was started in 1975 , but after the perimeter wall was complete and the foundations in place , works was halted . The plot of land then passed from private hands ( as the Great Kursaal had been private ) to public hands , so a public consortium was created for the purposes of constructing a new building . After the project was written down between 1991 and 1994 , the works were begun in 1996 , and were not finished until 1999 . During this period some funding problems arose , mainly because of the refusal of the Basque Government ( who paid for a 16 % of the total cost ) to increase the funds . After these problems were solved , the works were concluded in 1999 . The Kursaal Congress Centre was designed by Rafael Moneo and awarded the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 2001 . The initial impact of the buildings in the Donostia landscape ( characterized by its French style architecture ) was deemed negative by Donostians : the curved sandstone buildings clashed with a sharp-edged crystal structure . The significance of the building ( opened August 23 , 1999 , with a concert of the Euskadi Simphonic Orchestra and Ainhoa Arteta ) was also eclipsed by the parallel construction of the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao , which was twice as expensive as the Kursaal . However , after an adaptation period , and thanks to the positive impact it had in the economy , tourism and cultural life of Donostia , most citizens today appreciate the Kursaal building , and support it . Night view of Kursaal Palace lit up with Rainbow flag colors . It is mainly constituted as two large prismatic volumes , that emerge from a platform . Each "" cube "" ( as they are known ) , is formed by an inner prismatic structure , surrounded by double translucent glass panels , which are supported by a metallic structure . Between the cubes there is a big walkable surface , with sights to the Zurriola Beach and the mouth of the Urumea river . Various concerts of the Donostia Jazz Festival ( "" Jazzaldia "" ) , and many other events , take place in that terrace . Kursaal Auditorium Placed inside the biggest cube ( and closest to the sea ) , this auditorium can hold an audience of 1,800 , and is the most frequently used one for big events . The first seat rows can be removed to make room for the orchestra in an opera . Chamber Hall This seats 600 people , and is placed in the small cube . It is used for congresses or smaller concerts . Multiple-use rooms These are used for a variety of events for more limited audiences . Exhibition halls The halls are used for housing galleries and other exhibitions . Kubo Hall It is an exhibition hall under the supervision of the Kutxa savings bank . Moreover , the building has a restaurant owned by MartÃ­n Berasategui , various shops in its basement , and a car park ."	Information/Explanation
1282	Do you remember the debut of Napster ? Say goodbye to cds and tape cassettes ( for those that still had that feature installed in their cars ) . With the invention of Napster , music was made available for free simply by streaming the music to shared folders on the computer . The age of digital music was born overnight . Napster exploded rapidly across the United States and around the world . The younger computer advance generation could not stream fast enough their favorite artist's music to their personal music libraries . Napster was great . Who wo n't like obtaining music for free ? Well , the musicians , their agents and recording companies did not like it one bit . How would you like working for free ? Essentially Napster stole all their profits by generously making their music available to everyone without charging them a dime . Naturally , the music industry fought back . Napster was clearly violating copyright infringement laws protected under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . Napster eventually lost the case and was forced to shut down in 2001 after not being able to comply with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling to block access of 100 % of infringing material when notified of that material's location on Napster's shared files . Napster may have shut down , but the age of digital music streaming did not . In the past few years other digital music streaming companies have emerged . Pandora and Spotify are both popular music streaming services . Each of these companies still offers free music to their members . Have you ever wondered how these companies are able to offer you music for free like Napster did without running into the same legal trouble as Napster ? The difference between their companies and Napster is that these companies pay the artists per song stream . In order for the artist's music to be made available to members , they need to first negotiate licensing agreements with the artist . The licensing agreements are based on monthly revenue , how many streams per month , how well known of an artist , and what country the stream is coming from . All these variables come into play when determining licensing terms . How then do these companies make money ? The model for generating money for these companies is the same . The companies let advertisers promote radio commercials onto their service in exchange for payment . Members who opt to receive the free basic membership are subjected to commercials periodically after several songs are played . If members wish to pay for an upgraded membership that allows them to listen to music without interruption of commercials , then these members pay an annual membership fee . This also helps contribute to the company's overall revenue . The digital music streaming business is constantly changing . As the technology advances and new applications are incorporated , the licensing agreements will need to evolve as well .	Information/Explanation
378	The past financial year has been an important one in the development of Evolutec as the company moves towards its objective of becoming a diversified biopharmaceutical company capable of the discovery , development and commercialisation of important therapeutic products . Evolutec made progress an all fronts as it obtained positive clinical results with its lead product candidate , rEV131 , positive trial results in cattle with its lead vaccine candidate in collaboration with Merial and exciting preclinical results with rEV576 in a myasthenia gravis model . The Company is in a position to make significant progress in the coming year . Evolutec now has the funds to conduct at least three definitive Phase II clinical studies on rEV131 during 2006 in a range of respiratory and ophthalmic indications . Furthermore it can also conduct the work to bring additional molecules into clinical development . This is due to the strong support that we received from our investors during two placings that took place in 2005 . Evolutec has recruited a team of experienced individuals to carry out our plans . The team brings to Evolutec a broad range of expertise in the key areas of discovery , drug development and business development . This is coupled with an experienced executive team to provide the leadership skills that Evolutec requires . The Company has also built up very good relations with a range of contract organisations both in the US and Europe to use in sub-contracting the development work . I would like to thank all the individuals both within Evolutec and our supplier companies who have worked on our projects for their dedicated efforts in the past year . In addition to the progress in products and people , Evolutec continues to evolve rapidly into a significant biotechnology company . The Company has moved its location to a business park in Reading which we believe is an attractive location to grow and commercialise our business . The Company has made significant strides in complying with the regulatory requirements placed on the Company both as a consequence of its public listing on the AIM Market as well as those imposed by international regulatory agencies in the drug development process . Our objective is to meet the highest regulatory standards wherever possible . In particular , we will be looking to strengthen the Board by the appointment of an additional Non-Executive Director in the coming year . Looking forward we expect the Company to deliver significant value to its shareholders .

I am not like the others ... although perhaps I am , except I pull my hair from my head and not my eyebrows or eyelashes . Oh , this is so hard but good to have someone I hope will not think I am silly or I am going mad !!! I can remember the day I started , vividly , why I do n't know , maybe some sort of turning point in my life at the age of ten . During my teenage years while going to high school it got to the point of having bald patches behind my ears . I got my hair cut to hide it , as we always had to have out hair up and you could see the bald spots clearly . I do n't remember my parents or anybody else saying anything to me about this , they were always too busy and did n't understand . I am now 48 , never got on with my parents and ran away from home when I was 14 , never went back till I was over 21 . I have never lived at home and can only stand a day there . I find it comes and goes , depending what happens in my life . I believe stress is a big factor . When I gave up smoking several years ago I had nothing to do with my hands so I took up hair pulling again , biting my nails and the skin around them . It 's worse when I am watching TV or not busy with my hands and when I have time to sit and do nothing , boredom . I usually head for the fridge or pull my hair out . Something - I am not sure what , must be happening in my life as in the last few years my weight has ballooned and my hair pulling has been bad in the last few months . I have been dieting and have now lost a lot but have been very very unhappy for a long time . I was never sexually abused by my parents , emotionally I would say , yes . When my parents spoke of their life as children I can now understand why they were like the way there were , always aloof and just out of reach . I always thought I was strange and I did something really weird , I had no idea there was a name for it until one night they featured one brave lady on a current affairs program about pulling her hair out , then I knew . Once , while I was at the doctors with my children I asked him about trichtillomania because I had heard people who have it do the same as I did , he told me not to be so silly , how could I have ADD and did I really think at my age I had it and did I want to start on all these drugs , with no cure . Obviously , that really put me off , I felt like a real idiot . That was years ago , my children are grown up now . THEN , last night because my hair pulling has been so bad in the last month I and I was at my witts end what to do , I do n't know why but I decided to type in ' pulling your hair out and eating it "" on my computer and bingo ! I could n't believe my eyes when all this info came up on your website and I could see with my own eyes that I am not alone after all these years ! I can stop it when I really try . I tell my hands not to do it and try not to think about it and it is very hard but the urge goes away in the end . Sometimes I can be pull free for months at a time then I think ' oh I have n't done that for ages and bang away it goes again ' that 's the way I describe it anyway . It is not an easy thing to accept there is something wrong with you . I have been through all the phyciatrists when I was younger , as I can not relate emotionally to my parents or children . When my Dad died last year I could not shed a tear and still can not . My Mum can not still tell me she loves me , even though I say it to spite her . Since I have grown older I have eventually been able to come to terms with the way I am and now have my ways to get around things . I am a very happy , strong , bubbly , outgoing , person on the outside but a very miserable person on the inside , with all these problems I hide very well . THANK YOU , THANK YOU !!"

56	"I Chapter Five The brick front was just in a line with the street , or rather the road . Behind the door hung a cloak with a small collar , a bridle , and a black leather cap , and on the floor , in a corner , were a pair of leggings , still covered with dry mud . On the right was the one apartment , that was both dining and sitting room . A canary yellow paper , relieved at the top by a garland of pale flowers , was puckered everywhere over the badly stretched canvas ; white calico curtains with a red border hung crossways at the length of the window ; and on the narrow mantelpiece a clock with a head of Hippocrates shone resplendent between two plate candlesticks under oval shades . On the other side of the passage was Charles's consulting room , a little room about six paces wide , with a table , three chairs , and an office chair . Volumes of the "" Dictionary of Medical Science , "" uncut , but the binding rather the worse for the successive sales through which they had gone , occupied almost along the six shelves of a deal bookcase . The smell of melted butter penetrated through the walls when he saw patients , just as in the kitchen one could hear the people coughing in the consulting room and recounting their histories . Then , opening on the yard , where the stable was , came a large dilapidated room with a stove , now used as a wood-house , cellar , and pantry , full of old rubbish , of empty casks , agricultural implements past service , and a mass of dusty things whose use it was impossible to guess . The garden , longer than wide , ran between two mud walls with espaliered apricots , to a hawthorn hedge that separated it from the field . In the middle was a slate sundial on a brick pedestal ; four flower beds with eglantines surrounded symmetrically the more useful kitchen garden bed . Right at the bottom , under the spruce bushes , was a cure in plaster reading his breviary . Emma went upstairs . The first room was not furnished , but in the second , which was their bedroom , was a mahogany bedstead in an alcove with red drapery . A shell box adorned the chest of drawers , and on the secretary near the window a bouquet of orange blossoms tied with white satin ribbons stood in a bottle . It was a bride's bouquet ; it was the other one's . She looked at it . Charles noticed it ; he took it and carried it up to the attic , while Emma seated in an arm-chair ( they were putting her things down around her ) thought of her bridal flowers packed up in a bandbox , and wondered , dreaming , what would be done with them if she were to die . During the first days she occupied herself in thinking about changes in the house . She took the shades off the candlesticks , had new wallpaper put up , the staircase repainted , and seats made in the garden round the sundial ; she even inquired how she could get a basin with a jet fountain and fishes . Finally her husband , knowing that she liked to drive out , picked up a second-hand dogcart , which , with new lamps and splashboard in striped leather , looked almost like a tilbury . He was happy then , and without a care in the world . A meal together , a walk in the evening on the highroad , a gesture of her hands over her hair , the sight of her straw hat hanging from the window-fastener , and many another thing in which Charles had never dreamed of pleasure , now made up the endless round of his happiness . In bed , in the morning , by her side , on the pillow , he watched the sunlight sinking into the down on her fair cheek , half hidden by the lappets of her night - cap. Seen thus closely , her eyes looked to him enlarged , especially when , on waking up , she opened and shut them rapidly many times . Black in the shade , dark blue in broad daylight , they had , as it were , depths of different colours , that , darker in the centre , grew paler towards the surface of the eye . His own eyes lost themselves in these depths ; he saw himself in miniature down to the shoulders , with his handkerchief round his head and the top of his shirt open . He rose . She came to the window to see him off , and stayed leaning on the sill between two pots of geranium , clad in her dressing gown hanging loosely about her . Charles , in the street buckled his spurs , his foot on the mounting stone , while she talked to him from above , picking with her mouth some scrap of flower or leaf that she blew out at him . Then this , eddying , floating , described semicircles in the air like a bird , and was caught before it reached the ground in the ill-groomed mane of the old white mare standing motionless at the door . Charles from horseback threw her a kiss ; she answered with a nod ; she shut the window , and he set off . And then along the highroad , spreading out its long ribbon of dust , along the deep lanes that the trees bent over as in arbours , along paths where the corn reached to the knees , with the sun on his back and the morning air in his nostrils , his heart full of the joys of the past night , his mind at rest , his flesh at ease , he went on , re-chewing his happiness , like those who after dinner taste again the truffles which they are digesting . Until now what good had he had of his life ? His time at school , when he remained shut up within the high walls , alone , in the midst of companions richer than he or cleverer at their work , who laughed at his accent , who jeered at his clothes , and whose mothers came to the school with cakes in their muffs ? Later on , when he studied medicine , and never had his purse full enough to treat some little work-girl who would have become his mistress ? Afterwards , he had lived fourteen months with the widow , whose feet in bed were cold as icicles . But now he had for life this beautiful woman whom he adored . For him the universe did not extend beyond the circumference of her petticoat , and he reproached himself with not loving her . He wanted to see her again ; he turned back quickly , ran up the stairs with a beating heart . Emma , in her room , was dressing ; he came up on tiptoe , kissed her back ; she gave a cry . He could not keep from constantly touching her comb , her ring , her fichu ; sometimes he gave her great sounding kisses with all his mouth on her cheeks , or else little kisses in a row all along her bare arm from the tip of her fingers up to her shoulder , and she put him away half-smiling , half-vexed , as you do a child who hangs about you . Before marriage she thought herself in love ; but the happiness that should have followed this love not having come , she must , she thought , have been mistaken . And Emma tried to find out what one meant exactly in life by the words felicity , passion , rapture , that had seemed to her so beautiful in books ."	Prose/Lyrical
1089	"GPU-Based Parallel Integration of Large Numbers of Independent ODE Systems â arXiv : 1611 . 02274v1 [ cs . MS ] 6 Nov 2016 Kyle E. Niemeyer â  School of Mechanical , Industrial , & Manufacturing Engineering , Oregon State University , OR , USA Chih-Jen Sung Department of Mechanical Engineering , University of Connecticut , Storrs , CT , USA 9 June 2014 Abstract The task of integrating a large number of independent ODE systems arises in various scientific and engineering areas . For nonstiff systems , common explicit integration algorithms can be used on GPUs , where individual GPU threads concurrently integrate independent ODEs with different initial conditions or parameters . One example is the fifth-order adaptive Runge â Kutta â Cash â Karp ( RKCK ) algorithm . In the case of stiff ODEs , standard explicit algorithms require impractically small time-step sizes for stability reasons , and implicit algorithms are therefore commonly used instead to allow larger time steps and reduce the computational expense . However , typical high-order implicit algorithms based on backwards differentiation formulae ( e.g. , VODE , LSODE ) involve complex logical flow that causes severe thread divergence when implemented on GPUs , limiting the performance . Therefore , alternate algorithms are needed . A GPUbased Runge â Kutta â Chebyshev ( RKC ) algorithm can handle moderate levels of stiffness and performs significantly faster than not only an equivalent CPU version but also a CPU-based implicit algorithm ( VODE ) based on results shown in the literature . In this chapter , we present the mathematical background , implementation details , and source code for the RKCK and RKC algorithms for use integrating large numbers of independent systems of ODEs on GPUs . In addition , brief performance comparisons are shown for each algorithm , demonstrating the potential benefit of moving to GPU-based ODE integrators . â Final version published in Numerical Computations with GPUs ( 2014 ) Springer International Publishing , Ch. 8 , pp. 159 â 182 .

One prominent example is simulation of reactive flows for modeling combustion [ 1 â 5 ] , atmospheric chemistry [ 6 , 7 ] , and groundwater transport [ 8 , 9 ] , where operator splitting [ 10 , 11 ] decouples the solution of the fluid transport ( e.g. , advection , diffusion ) and chemical kinetics terms . This results in large numbers of independent ODEs for conservation of chemical species masses , with one system for each spatial location . The solution of the aggregate of these ODEs consumes most of the total wall-clock time of such simulations , > 90 % in some cases . Simulations of electrical behavior in cardiac tissue use a similar operator splitting technique , which results in ODE systems for cell membrane dynamics [ 12 , 13 ] . Other areas that deal with solving many independent systems of ODEs include systems biology [ 14 , 15 ] and Monte Carlo methods for sensitivity analysis of ODEs [ 16 â 18 ] . In such problems , large numbers of the same governing ODEs with different initial conditions and / or input parameters must be integrated ; since each system is independent , the entire set of ODEs can be integrated concurrently . While performance can be improved by using parallel central processing unit ( CPU ) methods , this embarrassingly parallel problem is especially well-suited to acceleration with the thread-based parallelism of graphics processing units ( GPUs ) , as demonstrated for reactive-flow simulations [ 19 â 22 ] . In particular , Niemeyer and Sung [ 22 ] recently developed a GPU-based approach for the integration of moderately stiff chemical kinetics ODEs using explicit integration algorithms , using an adaptive fifth-order Runge â Kutta â Cash â Karp ( RKCK ) method for nonstiff cases and a stabilized second-order Runge â Kutta â Chebyshev ( RKC ) method for problems with greater stiffness . For large numbers of ODEs , they demonstrated that the GPU-based RKCK and RKC algorithms performed up to 126 and 65 times faster , respectively , than CPU versions of the same algorithm on a single CPU core . Furthermore , with moderate levels of stiffness , the GPU-based RKC offered a speedup factor of 57 compared to a conventional implicit algorithm executed in parallel on a six-core CPU . The specific acceleration demonstrated depending on the problem studied ( e.g. , the kinetic mechanism ) and number of ODEs considered . Due to the favorable performance of these methods , in this chapter we present the integration algorithms , associated GPU source code , and implementation details so that interested readers can apply them to more general applications ( e.g. , the areas described above ) . 2 Mathematical Background In this chapter , we represent a generic system of ODEs using d ~ y = f ~ ( t , ~ y ( t ) , ~ g ) , dt ( 1 ) where ~ y ( t ) is the vector of unknown dependent variables at some time t , f ~ is the right-hand-side vector function , and ~ g is a vector of constant parameters ( e.g. , pressure or temperature for chemical kinetics ) . The size of ~ y ( i.e. , the number of equations / unknowns ) is N. For the types of problems with which we are concerned here , a large number of ODE systems , Node , each given by Eq. ( 1 ) must be integrated independently from some time t = tn to tn + 1 , with different initial conditions ~ y ( tn ) and constant parameters ~ g for each system . The numerical approximation to the exact solution ~ y ( tn ) is ~ yn , and the step size for a given step is Î´tn = tn + 1 â tn . Nonstiff ODEs , or those with little stiffness , can be solved using explicit integration methods . Many such methods exist , and algorithms can be classified in general into Runge â Kutta and linear 1 i ai 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 5 3 10 3 5 1 7 8 j bij ci c â i 37 378 2825 27648 250 621 125 594 18575 48384 13525 55296 277 14336 1 4 0 1 5 3 40 3 10 11 â 54 1631 55296 9 40 9 â 10 5 2 175 512 6 5 â 70 27 575 13824 35 27 44275 110592 253 4096 1 2 3 4 5 0 512 1771 0 Table 1 : Coefficients for the fifth-order Runge â Kutta â Cash â Karp method , adopted from Press et al. [ 26 ] . multistep methods , and also into explicit or implicit methods ; see Hairer and Wanner [ 23 ] for more details . Stiffness , a concept somewhat difficult to quantify , refers to the quality of an ODE making standard explicit methods perform poorly due to the requirement for unreasonably small time-step sizes â otherwise the solutions become unstable and oscillate wildly [ 24 ] . Traditionally , implicit integration algorithms such as those based on backwards difference formulas have been used to handle stiff equations , but these require expensive linear algebra operations on the Jacobian matrix ( e.g. , LU decomposition , matrix inversion ) . The complex logical flow of such operations results in highly divergent instructions across different initial conditions , making implicit algorithms unsuitable for operation on GPUs . In fact , Stone and Davis [ 21 ] implemented a traditional high-order implicit algorithm on GPUs , and found that it performed only slightly better than a multi-core CPU version of the same algorithm would . While implicit algorithms may be required for ODE systems with extreme levels of stiffness ( suggesting that new solutions need to be found for GPU acceleration of such problems ) , other options can be used for cases of little-to-moderate stiffness . Here , we describe two integration algorithms suitable for use solving many independent systems of ODEs on GPUs . 2.1 Runge â Kutta â Cash â Karp For nonstiff ODEs , an appropriate explicit algorithm is the fifth-order Runge â Kutta method developed by Cash and Karp [ 25 ] : the RKCK method . The RKCK method estimates the local truncation error using an embedded fourth-order method , by taking the difference between the fourth - and fifth-order solutions . It then uses this estimate to adaptively select the step size [ 26 ] . Using the terminology established above , the RKCK formulas â which also apply to any general 2 fifth-order Runge â Kutta method â are k ~ 1 = Î´tn f ~ ( tn , ~ yn , ~ g ) , ( 2 ) ~ k2 = Î´tn f ~ tn + a2 Î´tn , ~ yn + b21 ~ k1 , ~ g ( 3 ) , ~ k3 = Î´tn f ~ tn + a3 Î´tn , ~ yn + b31 ~ k1 + b32 ~ k2 , ~ g ( 4 ) , ~ k4 = Î´tn f ~ tn + a4 Î´tn , ~ yn + b41 ~ k1 + b42 ~ k2 + b43 ~ k3 , ~ g ( 5 ) , ~ k5 = Î´tn f ~ tn + a5 Î´tn , ~ yn + b51 ~ k1 + b52 ~ k2 + b53 ~ k3 + b54 ~ k4 , ~ g ~ k6 = Î´tn f ~ tn + a6 Î´tn , ~ yn + b61 ~ k1 + b62 ~ k2 + b63 ~ k3 + b64 ~ k4 + b65 ~ k5 , ~ g ~ yn + 1 = ~ yn + c1 ~ k1 + c2 ~ k2 + c3 ~ k3 + c4 ~ k4 + c5 ~ k5 + c6 ~ k6 , â ~ yn + 1 = ~ yn + c â 1 ~ k1 + c â 2 ~ k2 + c â 3 ~ k3 + c â 4 ~ k4 + c â 5 ~ k5 + c â 6 ~ k6 , ( 6 ) ,, ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) â where ~ yn + 1 is the fifth-order solution and ~ yn + 1 is the solution of the embedded fourth-order method . The RKCK coefficients are given in Table 1 . The local error â n + 1 is estimated using the difference between the fourth - and fifth-order solutions : â â n + 1 = ~ yn + 1 â ~ yn + 1 = 6 X ( ci â c â i ) ~ ki . ( 10 ) i = 1 Then , this error is compared against a desired accuracy , â 0 , defined by â 0 = Îµ | ~ yn | + Î´tn f ~ ( tn , ~ yn , ~ g ) + Î´ , ( 11 ) where Îµ is a tolerance level and Î´ represents a small value ( e.g. , 10 â 30 ) . When the estimated error rises above the desired accuracy ( â n + 1 > â 0 ) , the algorithm rejects the current step and calculates a smaller step size . Correspondingly , the algorithms accepts a step with error at or below the desired accuracy ( â n + 1 â¤ â 0 ) and calculates a new step size for the next step using ! 1 / 5 â 0 , i if â n + 1 â¤ â 0 , or S Î´t max n â n + 1 , i i Î´tnew = ! 1 / 4 â 0 , i if â n + 1 > â 0 . S Î´tn max i â n + 1 , i ( 12 ) Here , i represents the ith element of the related vector and S denotes a safety factor slightly smaller than unity ( e.g. , 0.9 ) . Equation ( 12 ) is used to calculate the next time step size both for an accepted step and also for a new , smaller step size in the case of a step rejection . In practice , step size decreases and increases are limited to factors of ten and five , respectively [ 26 ] . 2.2 Runge â Kutta â Chebyshev For ODEs with moderate levels of stiffness , one alternative to implicit algorithms is a stabilized explicit scheme such as the RKC method [ 27 â 32 ] . While the RKC method is explicit , it handles stiffness through additional stages â past the first two required for second-order accuracy â that extend its stability domain along the negative real axis of eigenvalues . Our RKC implementation is taken from Sommeijer et al. [ 31 ] and Verwer et al. [ 32 ] . Following the same terminology as above , the formulas for the second-order RKC are w ~ 0 = ~ yn , ( 13 ) 3 w ~ 1 = w ~ 0 + Î¼ Ì 1 Î´tn f ~ 0 , ( 14 ) w ~ j = ( 1 â Î¼j â Î½j ) w ~ 0 + Î¼j w ~ j â 1 + Î½j w ~ j â 2 + Î¼ Ì j Î´tn f ~ j â 1 + Î³ Ì j Î´tn f ~ 0 , j = 2 , ... , s , ~ yn + 1 = w ~ s , ( 15 ) ( 16 ) where s is the total number of stages and w ~ j are internal vectors for the stages . The right-hand-side ~ derivative vector function , fj , is evaluated at each stage , such that f ~ j = f ~ ( tn + cj Î´tn , w ~ j , ~ g ) . The recursive nature of w ~ j allows the use of only five arrays for storage . The coefficients used in Eqs . ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) can be obtained analytically for any number of stages s â¥ 2 : Î¼ Ì 1 = b1 Ï1 , Î³ Ì j = â aj â 1 Î¼ Ì j , w0 = 1 + Îº , s2 2bj Ï0 , bj â 1 Î½j = â bj , bj â 2 b0 = b2 , b1 = 1 , Ï0 Î¼j = Ï1 = Ts0 ( Ï0 ) , Ts00 ( Ï0 ) 2bj Ï1 , bj â 1 Tj00 ( Ï0 ) Î¼ Ì j = bj = 2 , Tj0 ( Ï0 ) aj = 1 â bj Tj ( Ï0 ) , ( 17 ) ( 18 ) ( 19 ) for j = 2 , ... , s , where Îº â¥ 0 is the damping parameter ( e.g. , Îº = 2 / 13 [ 31 , 32 ] ) . The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind , Tj ( x ) with first and second derivatives Tj0 ( x ) and Tj00 ( x ) , respectively , are defined recursively as Tj ( x ) = 2xTj â 1 ( x ) â Tj â 2 ( x ) , j = 2 , ... , s , ( 20 ) where T0 ( x ) = 1 and T1 ( x ) = x . The cj used in the function evaluations are c1 = cj = c2 c2 , â 0 T2 ( Ï0 ) 4 Ts0 ( Ï0 ) Tj00 ( Ï0 ) Ts00 ( Ï0 ) Tj0 ( Ï0 ) ( 21 ) â j2 â 1 , s2 â 1 2 â¤ j â¤ s â 1 , cs = 1 . ( 22 ) ( 23 ) As with the RKCK method in Sec. 2.1 , the RKC method can also be used with an adaptive time stepping method for error control , as given by Sommeijer et al. [ 31 ] . The error accrued in taking the step tn + 1 = tn + Î´tn and obtaining ~ yn + 1 is estimated using 4 2 â n + 1 = ( ~ yn â ~ yn + 1 ) + Î´tn ( f ~ n + f ~ n + 1 ) . 5 5 ( 24 ) We then obtain the weighted RMS norm of error using this error estimate with absolute and relative tolerances : â n + 1 k â n + 1 kRMS = â , ~ T N 2 ~ ~ T = A + R Â· max ( | ~ yn | , | ~ yn + 1 | ) , ( 25 ) ( 26 ) ~ is the vector of where N represents the number of unknown variables as defined previously , A absolute tolerances , and R is the relative tolerance . The norm k Â· k2 indicates the Euclidean or L2 norm . If k â n + 1 kRMS â¤ 1 , the step is accepted ; otherwise , it is rejected and repeated using a 4 smaller step size . Finally , a new step size is calculated using the weighted RMS norm of error for the current and prior steps , as well as the associated step sizes , via Î´tn + 1 = min ( 10 , max ( 0 . 1 , f )) Î´tn , f = 0.8 1 / ( p + 1 ) k â n kRMS 1 / ( p + 1 ) k â n + 1 kRMS Î´tn Î´tn â 1 ( 27 ) 1 ! 1 / ( p + 1 ) , k â n kRMS ( 28 ) where p = 2 , the order of the algorithm . We use Eq. ( 27 ) with a modified relation to calculate a new step size for a step rejection : 0.8 f = . ( 29 ) 1 / ( p + 1 ) k â n kRMS Determining the initial time step size requires special consideration . First , the algorithm takes a tentative integration step , using the inverse of the spectral radius Ï â the magnitude of the largest eigenvalue â of the Jacobian matrix as the step size . Then , after estimating the error associated with this tentative step , it calculates a new step size following a similar procedure to that given in Eqs . ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) : 1 , Ï â 0 = Î´t0 f ~ ( t0 + Î´t0 , ~ y0 + Î´t0 f ~ ( t0 , ~ y0 )) â f ~ ( t0 , ~ y0 ) , Î´t0 = Î´t1 = 0.1 Î´t0 1 / 2 ( 30 ) ( 31 ) ( 32 ) , k â 0 kRMS ~ 0 kRMS is evaluated in the same manner as k â ~ n + 1 kRMS using Eq. ( 25 ) . where k â After selecting the optimal time step size to control local error , the algorithm next determines the optimal number of RKC stages in order to remain stable . Due to stiffness , too few stages could lead to instability ; in contrast , using more stages than required would add unnecessary computational effort . The number of stages is determined using the spectral radius and time step size : s = 1 + p 1 + 1.54 Î´tn Ï , ( 33 ) as suggested by Sommeijer et al. [ 31 ] , where the value 1.54 is related to the stability boundary of the algorithm . Note that s may vary between time steps due to a changing spectral radius and time step size . We recommend using a nonlinear power method [ 31 ] to calculate the spectral radius with our RKC implementation ; this choice costs an additional vector to store the computed eigenvector , but avoids storing or calculating the Jacobian matrix directly . Following Sommeijer et al. [ 31 ] , our RKC implementation estimates the spectral radius every 25 ( internal ) steps or after a step rejection . 3 Source Code Next , we provide implementation details and source code for the GPU versions of the algorithms described above . The number of unknowns ( and corresponding equations ) N is represented with the variable NEQN , and the number of ODE systems Node is defined as numODE in the following code . In order for the GPU algorithms to offer a performance increase over CPU algorithms , Node should be relatively large . Although the exact number of ODEs where the GPU algorithm becomes faster than its CPU equivalent is problem dependent , Niemeyer and Sung [ 22 ] showed that a GPU implementation of the RKCK algorithm for chemical kinetics outperforms an equivalent serial CPU 5 version for as little as 128 ODE systems . All operations are given here in double precision , although depending on the particular needs of the specific application single-precision calculations may be preferable to reduce the computational expense . In order to take advantage of global memory coalescing on the GPU , we recommend storing the the set of dependent variable vectors ~ yi , where i = 1 , ... , Node , in a single one-dimensional array , where variables corresponding to the same unknown for consecutive systems sit adjacent in memory . ~ is a two-dimensional matrix with Node rows and N columns , where the ith row In other words , if Y ~ should be stored in memory as a one-dimensional array in contains the unknown vector ~ yi , then Y column-major ordering . This ensures that adjacent GPU threads in the same warp access adjacent global memory locations when reading or writing equivalent array elements . See Kirk and Hwu [ 33 ] or Jang et al. [ 34 ] for more details and examples on global memory coalescing . The following code snippet shows the proper loading of a host array yHost from an arbitrary array y that contains initial conditions for all ODEs : 1 2 double * yHost ; yHost = ( double * ) malloc ( numODE * NEQN * sizeof ( double )) ; 3 4 5 6 7 8 for ( int i = 0 ; i < numODE ; ++ i ) { for ( int j = 0 ; j < NEQN ; ++ j ) { yHost [ i + numODE * j ] = y [ i ] [ j ] ; } } A similar procedure should be used for the constant parameter vector ~ g if needed . Next , the GPU global memory arrays should be declared and initialized , and the block / grid dimensions set up using 1 2 double * yDevice ; cudaMalloc (( void ** ) & yDevice , numODE * NEQN * sizeof ( double )) ; 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 int blockSize ; if ( numODE < 4194304 ) { blockSize = 64 ; } else if ( numODE < 8388608 ) { blockSize = 128 ; } else if ( numODE < 16777216 ) { blockSize = 256 ; } else { blockSize = 512 ; } dim3 dimBlock ( blockSize , 1 ) ; dim3 dimGrid ( numODE / dimBlock . x , 1 ) ; Here , we use simple one-dimensional block and grid dimensions ; reshaping the grid should not affect performance , but can be done for convenience . We chose 64 as the block size for problems with less than 4,194,304 ODEs based on experience for chemical kinetics problems [ 22 ] . The size should remain a power of two , but different block sizes may be optimal for other problems . The final step is to set up the ODE integration loop and kernel function execution . The integration driver kernel , to be described shortly , will perform internal sub-stepping as necessary to reach the specified end time . Depending on the objectives , there are various ways to approach this : â¢ If only the final integrated results are needed , then a single GPU kernel can be invoked . â¢ If intermediate integration results are needed , then an acceptable outer step size over which results will be spaced should be chosen , and the GPU kernel should be invoked inside a loop . 6 We will leave the code as general as possible by following the second approach , although modifications should be made depending on the desired functionality . In both cases , the global memory array holding the variables to be integrated needs to be transferred to the GPU before , and from the GPU after , each kernel invocation . 1 2 3 // set initial time double t = t0 ; double tNext = t + h ; 4 5 6 7 while ( t < tEnd ) { // transfer memory to GPU cudaMemcpy ( yDevice , yHost , numODE * NEQN * sizeof ( double ) , c uda Me mc py Hos tT oD ev i c e ) ; 8 intDriver <<< dimGrid , dimBlock > > > ( t , tNext , numODE , gDevice , yDevice ) ; 9 10 // transfer memory back to CPU cudaMemcpy ( yHost , yDevice , numODE * NEQN * sizeof ( double ) , c uda Me mc py Dev ic eT oH o s t ) ; 11 12 13 t = tNext ; tNext + = h ; 14 15 16 } 17 18 19 cudaFree ( gDevice ) ; cudaFree ( yDevice ) ; Here , t0 refers to the initial time , tEnd the desired final time , and h the outer step size . In the current form , each outer integration step performed by the GPU will be a "" restart "" integration , meaning no information about previous steps ( e.g. , error estimates , step sizes ) will be used to assist the startup . This is necessary in certain applications such as reactive-flow simulations ( and other simulation methods that use operator splitting ) , where after each outer step integration results are combined with changes due to fluid transport , thereby invalidating stored integration information . However , where possible , better performance may be obtained by transferring the appropriate data from the GPU and used in the next overall integration step . The next code snippet contains the general integration driver kernel , suitable for either algorithm : 1 2 3 4 5 __global__ void intDriver ( const double t , const double tEnd , const int numODE , const double * gGlobal , double * yGlobal ) { // unique thread ID , based on local ID in block and block ID int tid = threadIdx . x + ( blockDim . x * blockIdx . x ) ; 6 7 8 // ensure thread within limit if ( tid < numODE ) { 9 10 11 // local array with initial values double yLocal [ NEQN ] ; 12 13 14 // constant parameter ( s ) double gLocal = gGlobal [ tid ] ; 15 16 17 18 19 // load local array with initial values from global array for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { yLocal [ i ] = yGlobal [ tid + numODE * i ] ; } 20 21 22 // call integrator for one time step integrator ( t , tEnd , yLocal , gGlobal ) ; 23 7 // update global array with integrated values for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { yGlobal [ tid + numODE * i ] = yLocal [ i ] ; } } 24 25 26 27 28 29 } The function integrator should be replaced with rkckDriver or rkcDriver ( given below ) depending on the desired integration algorithm . 3.1 RKCK Code In the following , the source code for the RKCK driver device function is given in functional snippets . First , the minimum and maximum allowable time step sizes are defined , and the initial step size is set as half the integration time . 1 2 3 __device__ void rkckDriver ( double t , const double tEnd , const double g , double * y ) { 4 5 6 7 // maximum and minimum allowable step sizes const double hMax = fabs ( tEnd - t ) ; const double hMin = 1.0 e -20 ; 8 9 10 // initial step size double h = 0.5 * fabs ( tEnd - t ) ; Then , inside the time integration loop , the algorithm takes a trial integration step and estimates the error of that step . 1 2 // integrate until specified end time while ( t < tEnd ) { 3 4 5 // limit step size based on remaining time h = fmin ( tEnd - t , h ) ; 6 7 8 // y and error vectors temporary until error determined double yTemp [ NEQN ] , yErr [ NEQN ] ; 9 10 11 12 // evaluate derivative double F [ NEQN ] ; dydt ( t , y , g , F ) ; 13 14 15 // take a trial step rkckStep ( t , y , g , F , h , yTemp , yErr ) ; 16 17 18 19 20 21 // calculate error double err = 0.0 ; int nanFlag = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { if ( isnan ( yErr [ i ] ) ) nanFlag = 1 ; 22 23 24 25 err = fmax ( err , fabs ( yErr [ i ] / ( fabs ( y [ i ] ) + fabs ( h * F [ i ] ) + TINY ))) ; } err / = eps ; If the error is too large , the step size is decreased and the step retaken ; otherwise , the algorithm accepts the step and calculates the next step size , then repeats the process . 8 // check if error too large if (( err > 1.0 ) || isnan ( err ) || ( nanFlag == 1 )) { // step failed , error too large if ( isnan ( err ) || ( nanFlag == 1 )) { h * = P1 ; } else { h = fmax ( SAFETY * h * pow ( err , PSHRNK ) , P1 * h ) ; } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 } else { // step accepted t + = h ; 10 11 12 13 if ( err > ERRCON ) { h = SAFETY * h * pow ( err , PGROW ) ; } else { h * = 5.0 ; } 14 15 16 17 18 19 // ensure step size is bounded h = fmax ( hMin , fmin ( hMax , h )) ; 20 21 22 for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) y [ i ] = yTemp [ i ] ; 23 24 } 25 } 26 27 } The device function dydt evaluates the derivative function F for the particular problem as in Eq. ( 1 ) using the input time t , vector of dependent variables y , and constant parameter ( s ) g . The device function rkcStep , not given here , takes a single integration step using Eqs . ( 2 ) â ( 9 ) , returning the vector of integrated values yTemp as well as the error vector yErr . A number of constants were used in this function , given here : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # define UROUND ( 2 . 22 e -16 ) # define SAFETY 0.9 # define PGROW ( - 0 . 2 ) # define PSHRNK ( - 0 . 25 ) # define ERRCON ( 1 . 89 e -4 ) # define TINY ( 1 . 0 e -30 ) const double eps = 1.0 e -10 ; 3.2 RKC Code The RKC driver algorithm is next given . For this algorithm , the number of stages must be determined at each step to handle local stiffness ; to avoid excess computation , a maximum number of stages is first set . In addition , minimum and maximum allowable time step sizes are defined . 1 2 3 4 __device__ void rkcDriver ( double t , const double tEnd , const double g , double * y ) { // number of steps int numStep = 0 ; 5 6 7 // maximum allowable number of RKC stages int mMax = ( int ) ( round ( sqrt ( relTol / ( 10 . 0 * UROUND )))) ; 8 9 10 // RKC needs at least two stages for second - order accuracy if ( mMax < 2 ) mMax = 2 ; 9 11 12 13 // maximum allowable step size const double stepSizeMax = fabs ( tEnd - t ) ; 14 15 16 // minimum allowable step size double stepSizeMin = 10.0 * UROUND * fmax ( fabs ( t ) , stepSizeMax ) ; Then , the algorithm evaluates the derivative using the initial conditions for use as the initial eigenvector estimate for the spectral radius calculation . The calculated eigenvectors are stored and used as initial guesses in later steps . 1 2 3 4 // internal y vector double y_n [ NEQN ] ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) y_n [ i ] = y [ i ] ; 5 6 7 8 // calculate F_n for initial y double F_n [ NEQN ] ; dydt ( t , y_n , g , F_n ) ; 9 10 11 // internal work vector double work [ 4 + NEQN ] ; 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // load initial estimate for eigenvector if ( work [ 2 ] < UROUND ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { work [ 4 + i ] = F_n [ i ] ; } } Inside the time integration loop , the algorithm calculates the spectral radius for the first step â which it next uses to determine the initial step size â and every 25 steps thereafter . 1 2 3 // perform internal sub - stepping while ( t < tEnd ) { double tempArr [ NEQN ] , tempArr2 [ NEQN ] , err ; 4 5 6 // if last step , limit step size if (( 1 . 1 * work [ 2 ] ) > = fabs ( tEnd - t )) work [ 2 ] = fabs ( tEnd - t ) ; 7 8 9 10 11 // estimate Jacobian spectral radius if 25 steps passed if (( numStep % 25 ) == 0 ) { work [ 3 ] = rkcSpecRad ( t , y_n , g , F_n , stepSizeMax , & work [ 4 ] , tempArr2 ) ; } For the initial step , a trial step is taken using the inverse of the spectral radius as the step size ; the resulting error is used to determine an appropriate step size that satisfies error control . 1 2 3 4 // if this is initial step if ( work [ 2 ] < UROUND ) { // estimate first time step work [ 2 ] = stepSizeMax ; 5 6 7 if (( work [ 3 ] * work [ 2 ] ) > 1.0 ) work [ 2 ] = 1.0 / work [ 3 ] ; work [ 2 ] = fmax ( work [ 2 ] , stepSizeMin ) ; 8 9 10 11 12 for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { temp_arr [ i ] = y_n [ i ] + ( work [ 2 ] * F_n [ i ] ) ; } dydt ( t + work [ 2 ] , tempArr , g , tempArr2 ) ; 10 13 err = 0.0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { double est = ( tempArr2 [ i ] - F_n [ i ] ) / ( absTol + relTol * fabs ( y_n [ i ] )) ; err + = est * est ; } err = work [ 2 ] * sqrt ( err / NEQN ) ; 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 if (( P1 * work [ 2 ] ) < ( stepSizeMax * sqrt ( err ))) { work [ 2 ] = fmax ( P1 * work [ 2 ] / sqrt ( err ) , stepSizeMin ) ; } else { work [ 2 ] = stepSizeMax ; } 21 22 23 24 25 26 } For all steps following the first , the value stored in work [ 2 ] is used for the time step size . Next , the number of stages is determined using the spectral radius and current time step size , and a tentative integration step performed . 1 2 // calculate number of steps int m = 1 + ( int ) ( sqrt ( 1 . 54 * work [ 2 ] * work [ 3 ] + 1.0 )) ; 3 4 5 6 7 8 // modify step size based on stages if ( m > mMax ) { m = mMax ; work [ 2 ] = (( double ) ( m * m - 1 ) ) / ( 1 . 54 * work [ 3 ] ) ; } 9 10 11 // perform tentative time step rkcStep ( t , y_n , g , F_n , work [ 2 ] , m , y ) ; The algorithm then estimates the error of that step . 1 2 // calculate derivative F_np1 with tentative y_np1 dydt ( t + work [ 2 ] , y , g , tempArr ) ; 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // estimate error err = 0.0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { double est = 0.8 * ( y_n [ i ] - y [ i ] ) + 0.4 * work [ 2 ] * ( F_n [ i ] + tempArr [ i ] ) ; est / = ( absTol + relTol * fmax ( fabs ( y [ i ] ) , fabs ( y_n [ i ] ))) ; err + = est * est ; } err = sqrt ( err / (( double ) N )) ; Based on the error magnitude , the algorithm determines whether to accept the step and proceed to the next step or decrease the step size and repeat the current step . 1 2 3 4 5 // check value of error if ( err > 1.0 ) { // error too large , step is rejected // select smaller step size work [ 2 ] = 0.8 * work [ 2 ] / ( pow ( err , ( 1 . 0 / 3.0 ))) ; 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // reevaluate spectral radius work [ 3 ] = rkcSpecRad ( t , y_n , g , F_n , stepSizeMax , & work [ 4 ] , tempArr2 ) ; } else { // step accepted t + = work [ 2 ] ; numStep ++ ; 11 Finally , for an accepted step , the current step size and error are stored and the next step size is calculated . double fac = 10.0 ; double temp1 , temp2 ; 1 2 3 if ( work [ 1 ] < UROUND ) { temp2 = pow ( err , ( 1 . 0 / 3.0 )) ; if ( 0 . 8 < ( fac * temp2 )) fac = 0.8 / temp2 ; } else { temp1 = 0.8 * work [ 2 ] * pow ( work [ 0 ] , ( 1 . 0 / 3.0 )) ; temp2 = work [ 1 ] * pow ( err , ( 2 . 0 / 3.0 )) ; if ( temp1 < ( fac * temp2 )) fac = temp1 / temp2 ; } 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // set "" old "" values to those for current time step work [ 0 ] = err ; work [ 1 ] = work [ 2 ] ; 13 14 15 16 for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { y_n [ i ] = y [ i ] ; F_n [ i ] = tempArr [ i ] ; } 17 18 19 20 21 work [ 2 ] * = fmax ( P1 , fac ) ; work [ 2 ] = fmax ( stepSizeMin , fmin ( stepSizeMax , work [ 2 ] )) ; 22 23 } 24 } 25 26 } As before , we do not provide the RKC integration step device function rkcStep , which evaluates Eqs . ( 13 ) â ( 16 ) . The absolute and relative tolerances absTol and relTol are set as defined constants , e.g. , : 1 2 const double abs_tol = 1.0 e -10 ; const double rel_tol = 1.0 e -6 ; Note that these may be modified to more stringent tolerances if desired . The constant UROUND is defined the same as in the RKCK code above . The local work array work contains , in element order : 0 the previous step error estimation , 1 previous time step , 2 current time step , 3 spectral radius , and 4 vector of eigenvalues ( of size N ) . The device function rkcSpecRad returns the spectral radius , the largest magnitude eigenvalue ; various methods may be used for this purpose depending on the case . We provide GPU source code for a nonlinear power method adopted from Sommeijer et al. [ 31 ] that may be used for general applications in the Appendix . 12 4 Performance Results We tested the performance of the GPU-based RKCK and RKC integration algorithms using two ODE test cases , ranging the number of ODE systems from 101 to 105 . For both cases , all calculations were performed in double precision using a single GPU and single CPU ; we compared the performance of the GPU algorithm against serial CPU calculations as well as parallelized CPU performance â via OpenMP [ 35 ] â on four cores . We performed the GPU calculations using an NVIDIA Tesla c2075 GPU with 6 GB of global memory , and an Intel Xeon X5650 CPU , running at 2.67 GHz with 256 kB of L2 cache memory per core and 12 MB of L3 cache memory , served as the host processor both for the GPU calculations and the CPU single - and four-core OpenMP calculations . We used the GNU Compiler Collection ( gcc ) version 4.6.2 ( with the compiler options "" - O3 - ffast-math - std = c99 - m64 "" ) to compile the CPU programs and the CUDA 5.5 compiler nvcc version 5.5.0 ( "" - O3 - arch = sm_20 - m64 "" ) to compile the GPU versions . We set the GPU to persistence mode , but also used the cudaSetDevice ( ) to hide any further device initialization delay in the CUDA implementations prior to the timing . The integration algorithms take as input initial conditions and a global time step , performing internal sub-stepping as necessary . The computational wall-clock times reported represent the average over ten global time steps , which for the GPU versions includes the overhead required for transmitting data between the CPU and GPU before and after each global step . The integrator restarts at each global time step , not storing any data from the previous step â although any substepping performed by the algorithm within these larger steps does benefit from retained information from prior sub-steps . Interested readers should refer to Niemeyer and Sung [ 22 ] for more detailed performance evaluations of these algorithms in the context of chemical kinetics problems . 4.1 RKCK Results We used the Pleiades ODE test problem ( PLEI ) of Hairer et al. [ 23 , 36 ] to test the GPU - and CPU-based versions of the RKCK integrator . This nonstiff test case originates from a celestial mechanisms problem tracking the coordinates of seven stars ; it consists of a set of 14 second-order ODEs based on Newtonian gravitational forces , in the form ~ x ~ z00 = ~ y ! 00 ( 1 ) x00i = fi f ~ ( 1 ) ( ~ x , ~ y ) , f ~ ( 2 ) ( ~ x , ~ y ) ! = ( ~ x , ~ y ) = X ~ z â < 14 , ( 34 ) mj ( xj â xi ) / rij , ( 35 ) mj ( yj â yi ) / rij , ( 36 ) 3 / 2 ( 37 ) j6 = i yi00 = ( 2 ) fi ( ~ x , ~ y ) = X j6 = i rij = ( xi â xj ) 2 + ( yi â yj ) , i , j = 1 , ... , 7 , where ( xi , yi ) and mi = i are the coordinates and mass of the ith star , respectively . This secondorder system can be converted into a system of 28 first-order ODEs of the form by defining w ~ = ~ z0 , such that ! 0 !! ~ z w ~ ~ z = ~ , â < 28 . ( 38 ) w ~ f ( ~ z ) w ~ While the original problem offers specific initial conditions for a single ODE system , here we consider a large number of ODEs with the initial conditions randomly perturbed by a small factor to 13 4 Speedup factor of RKCK-GPU 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 103 RKCK-GPU vs. RKCK-CPU RKCK-GPU vs. RKCK-CPU Ã 4 104 105 Number of independent ODE systems Figure 1 : Speedup factors offered by GPU-based explicit RKCK integration algorithm over singleand four-core CPU-based versions for Pleiades ODE problem . Note that the horizontal axis is displayed in logarithmic scale . 14 emulate a sensitivity analysis . We integrated the ODE systems from t = 0 s to 1.0 s using 1.0 Ã 10 â 1 s as the global time step size . We set the RKCK tolerance Îµ ( eps in the code ) to 1.0 Ã 10 â 10 . Figure 1 shows the speedup factors , measured as the ratio of computational times per step , offered by the GPU-based RKCK algorithm over the baseline CPU version for both serial and four-core parallel operation , for numbers of ODE systems ranging from 1024 to 262,144 . The GPU-based algorithm ran faster than the serial and parallel CPU-based algorithms for Node larger than 4096 and 8192 , respectively . For the current problem , at best the GPU offered a speedup factors of nearly four and two over the serial and four-core CPU implementations , respectively . The non-smooth performance scaling resulted from the randomly perturbed initial conditions . Note that since each ODE system used randomly perturbed initial conditions , adjacent threads in the GPU implementation handled potentially extremely different initial condition values , resulting in thread divergence due to varying internal time step sizes . Therefore , the results shown here represent a worst-case GPU algorithm performance , particularly compared to applications involving operator-split reactive-flow codes where adjacent threads / ODE systems correspond to neighboring spatial locations . In such situations , initial conditions would be more similar and therefore follow similar instruction pathways . In either case , GPU-based integration algorithms offer performance benefits over the baseline CPU versions . See Niemeyer and Sung [ 22 ] for more discussion on this topic . Furthermore , the current problem involved a relatively simple system of ODEs , limiting the calculations performed on the GPU between the memory transfers before and after each integration step . ODE systems with more complex derivative functions would saturate the GPU with operations , increasing performance . For example , the RKCK algorithm demonstrated by Niemeyer and Sung [ 22 ] performed up to 126 times faster on a GPU than on a serial CPU , integrating a chemical kinetics ODE system with nine species participating in 38 reaction steps â requiring significantly more floating-point calculations than the case studied here . 4.2 RKC Results To demonstrate the performance of the GPU-based RKC algorithm , we used a chemical kinetics problem : the ODE system describing the constant-volume autoignition of ethanol ( C2 H5 OH ) . We implemented the reaction mechanism of Marinov [ 37 ] to describe the oxidation of ethanol , with 57 species participating in 766 irreversible reaction steps . The governing ODE system contained 58 ~ : equations : one for temperature T and the rest for species mass fractions Y d ~ y = dt dYNsp dT dY1 ,, ... , dt dt dt | , ( 39 ) Nsp dT 1 X = â ei Ïi Wi , dt Ïcv i = 1 dYi Wi Ïi = , i = 1 , ... , Nsp , dt Ï Ïi = NX reac Nsp 00 Î½ij â 0 Î½ij j = 1 kj Y Î½0 Ck kj , ( 40 ) ( 41 ) ( 42 ) k = 1 where Ï indicates the density , cv the mass-averaged constant-volume specific heat , ei the internal 00 and Î½ 0 the forward and energy of the ith species , Wi the molecular weight of the ith species , Î½ij ij reverse stoichiometric coefficients for the ith species in reaction j , Ck the molar concentration of the kth species , and Nsp and Nreac are the numbers of species and reactions , respectively .

Note that both axes are displayed in logarithmic scale . reaction j without pressure dependence , the rate coefficient kj is given in Arrhenius form by kj = Aj T Î²j â Ej exp RT , ( 43 ) where R is the universal gas constant , Aj the pre-exponential coefficient , Î²j the temperature exponent , and Ej the activation energy . Note that reactions can be pressure-dependent ( see , e.g. , Law [ 38 ] for examples of various pressure-dependence formulations ) ; these were also considered in the current implementation . This problem is moderately stiff using a time step size of Î´t = 1.0 Ã 10 â 6 s for 10 global time steps . In this case , we generated initial conditions for the set of ODE systems by sampling the solutions obtained from constant-pressure homogeneous ignition simulations , initiated at 1600 K , 1 atm , and an equivalence ratio of one1 . We assigned these initial conditions sequentially , such that adjacent threads in the GPU implementation contained data from consecutive time steps in the sample â and therefore such threads handled the integration of similar conditions , emulating adjacent spatial locations in an operator-split reactive-flow simulation . Figure 2 shows the speedup factors offered by the GPU-based RKC algorithm over the baseline CPU version for both serial and four-core parallel operation , for numbers of ODE systems ranging from 64 to 16,384 . In this case , the GPU-accelerated code ran faster than the serial CPU version for the entire range of ODE system sizes considered , while it offered better performance than the four-core parallel CPU version for 256 ODEs and higher . At best , the GPU-based RKC algorithm 1 An equivalence ratio of one indicates the mixture of fuel and oxidizer set to an appropriate ratio for complete combustion . 16 ran nearly 64 and 17 times faster than the serial and four-core CPU implementations , respectively . The discontinuity in speedup seen in Fig. 2 corresponded to the inclusion of conditions leading to greater stiffness . 5 Conclusions In this chapter , we presented two explicit algorithms appropriate for integrating large numbers of independent ODE systems on GPUs . Specifically , we proposed the fifth-order adaptive Runge â Kutta â Cash â Karp ( RKCK ) method for nonstiff problems and the stabilized second-order adaptive Runge â Kutta â Chebyshev ( RKC ) method for problems with moderate levels of stiffness . Source code and implementation details were presented to ease the adoption of such methods , and performance comparison results were presented for each method . The examples shown here served to demonstrate the potential of GPU acceleration where many independent systems of ODEs need to be integrated ; in the case of the RKC algorithm , we demonstrated more than an order of magnitude performance increase over an equivalent parallel CPU code running on four cores . The types of scientific and engineering problems dealing with large numbers of ODEs â in particular , reactive-flow models that rely on operator splitting â can benefit significantly from GPU acceleration ; interested readers can directly implement the algorithms presented here to such ends , or use them as the beginnings for their own solution .

In turn you will receive a renewable 5 year agreement covering an exclusive area and the full support of the Click IT ! team . Training and Support From finance to running an IT business Harsha Popat worked in finance for 12 years . Her experience is serving her well in her new career as a franchisee running her own business teaching IT to young children . Having been made redundant from her finance job when she had her second child 10 years ago , Harsha decided to spend quality time with her children because she felt she did n't want to miss out those important early years with them . When her youngest started pre-school she began looking around for work . She had a friend who worked with Click IT ! Kids , a business teaching IT to children in nurseries , who told her it was term-time only and you could work it around school time . "" It sounded fantastic . It meant I could drop my kids off and pick them up and have some ' me ' time , "" she said . Harsha sent in her CV through her friend . Meanwhile she saw an advert in the local paper for teachers . "" I did n't know it was for Click IT ! Kids and I called up . The manager said she happened to be looking at my CV [ which she was given by my friend ] . "" Harsha was given full training in how to teach IT skills to children . Click IT ! Kids has detailed lesson plans and specially developed software . She then started working in two nurseries and gradually built up the number of nurseries she covered . She would typically finish her classes by 12 noon each day . Franchisee Harsha had so much confidence in the programme that last year she decided to take out a franchise with Click IT ! Kids . Her children are now 13 and 10 and she wanted to take on running her own business , so she set up Click IT ! Barnet . "" The kids love it , "" she says . "" The minute they know you are there , they can not wait for their turn . The younger ones are in groups of two and the older ones are taught in groups of up to three . You really notice the difference . If they start at two they are well ahead of their peers when they start school . It also benefits the nurseries as Click IT ! Kids takes away the burden they would normally have of teaching IT to children as part of the Early Years Foundation Scheme ( EYFS ) National Curriculum . "" The children progress at their own pace , starting with learning mouse and cursor skills . The lesson plans cover the early learning goals ; so in addition to IT skills they learn numeracy and literacy skills on the computer . "" When the children start school they can recognise their numbers and the alphabet . They are really confident about navigating around programmes and opening and shutting down the computer , "" says Harsha . Despite running the Click IT ! Barnet franchise , which includes administrative work and marketing to potential nurseries , Harsha still keeps her hand in at teaching and still mainly works during term time . For instance , she runs open days at the end of the summer term to recruit children for the autumn term . She covers Barnet , Hampstead and parts of Enfield in north London as part of her franchise . Harsha employs another teacher to give her more time to do marketing and gradually grow the business . She sometimes logs on at night , but never works later than 10pm . "" My financial background helps with running the business , "" she says , "" but I do not miss my former job . You can not compare the time you gain with your children . It 's fantastic .

49	"CHAPTER VI The next day commenced as before , getting up and dressing by rushlight ; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing ; the water in the pitchers was frozen . A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening , and a keen north-east wind , whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long , had made us shiver in our beds , and turned the contents of the ewers to ice . Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over , I felt ready to perish with cold . Breakfast-time came at last , and this morning the porridge was not burnt ; the quality was eatable , the quantity small . How small my portion seemed ! I wished it had been doubled . In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class , and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me : hitherto , I had only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood ; I was now to become an actor therein . At first , being little accustomed to learn by heart , the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult ; the frequent change from task to task , too , bewildered me ; and I was glad when , about three o ' clock in the afternoon , Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long , together with needle , thimble , & c . , and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom , with directions to hem the same . At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise ; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading , and as all was quiet , the subject of their lessons could be heard , together with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself , and the animadversions or commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance . It was English history : among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah : at the commencement of the lesson , her place had been at the top of the class , but for some error of pronunciation , or some inattention to stops , she was suddenly sent to the very bottom . Even in that obscure position , Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice : she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following : -- "" Burns "" ( such it seems was her name : the girls here were all called by their surnames , as boys are elsewhere ) , "" Burns , you are standing on the side of your shoe ; turn your toes out immediately . "" "" Burns , you poke your chin most unpleasantly ; draw it in . "" "" Burns , I insist on your holding your head up ; I will not have you before me in that attitude , "" & c . & c . A chapter having been read through twice , the books were closed and the girls examined . The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles I. , and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship - money , which most of them appeared unable to answer ; still , every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns : her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson , and she was ready with answers on every point . I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention ; but , instead of that , she suddenly cried out -- "" You dirty , disagreeable girl ! you have never cleaned your nails this morning ! "" Burns made no answer : I wondered at her silence . "" Why , "" thought I , "" does she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face , as the water was frozen ? "" My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein of thread : while she was winding it , she talked to me from time to time , asking whether I had ever been at school before , whether I could mark , stitch , knit , & c . ; till she dismissed me , I could not pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements . When I returned to my seat , that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the import ; but Burns immediately left the class , and going into the small inner room where the books were kept , returned in half a minute , carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end . This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy ; then she quietly , and without being told , unloosed her pinafore , and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs . Not a tear rose to Burns' eye ; and , while I paused from my sewing , because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger , not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression . "" Hardened girl ! "" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd ; "" nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits : carry the rod away . "" Burns obeyed : I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the book-closet ; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket , and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek . The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at Lowood : the bit of bread , the draught of coffee swallowed at five o ' clock had revived vitality , if it had not satisfied hunger : the long restraint of the day was slackened ; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly , to supply , in some measure , the place of candles , not yet introduced : the ruddy gloaming , the licensed uproar , the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty . On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her pupil , Burns , I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups without a companion , yet not feeling lonely : when I passed the windows , I now and then lifted a blind , and looked out ; it snowed fast , a drift was already forming against the lower panes ; putting my ear close to the window , I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within , the disconsolate moan of the wind outside . Probably , if I had lately left a good home and kind parents , this would have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the separation ; that wind would then have saddened my heart ; this obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace ! as it was , I derived from both a strange excitement , and reckless and feverish , I wished the wind to howl more wildly , the gloom to deepen to darkness , and the confusion to rise to clamour . Jumping over forms , and creeping under tables , I made my way to one of the fire-places ; there , kneeling by the high wire fender , I found Burns , absorbed , silent , abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book , which she read by the dim glare of the embers . "" Is it still ' Rasselas ' ? "" I asked , coming behind her . "" Yes , "" she said , "" and I have just finished it . "" And in five minutes more she shut it up . I was glad of this . "" Now , "" thought I , "" I can perhaps get her to talk . "" I sat down by her on the floor . "" What is your name besides Burns ? "" "" Helen . "" "" Do you come a long way from here ? "" "" I come from a place farther north , quite on the borders of Scotland . "" "" Will you ever go back ? "" "" I hope so ; but nobody can be sure of the future . "" "" You must wish to leave Lowood ? "" "" No ! why should I ? I was sent to Lowood to get an education ; and it would be of no use going away until I have attained that object . "" "" But that teacher , Miss Scatcherd , is so cruel to you ? "" "" Cruel ? Not at all ! She is severe : she dislikes my faults . "" "" And if I were in your place I should dislike her ; I should resist her . If she struck me with that rod , I should get it from her hand ; I should break it under her nose . "" "" Probably you would do nothing of the sort : but if you did , Mr. Brocklehurst would expel you from the school ; that would be a great grief to your relations . It is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself , than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you ; and besides , the Bible bids us return good for evil . "" "" But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged , and to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of people ; and you are such a great girl : I am far younger than you , and I could not bear it . "" "" Yet it would be your duty to bear it , if you could not avoid it : it is weak and silly to say you _can not bear_ what it is your fate to be required to bear . "" I heard her with wonder : I could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance ; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the forbearance she expressed for her chastiser . Still I felt that Helen Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes . I suspected she might be right and I wrong ; but I would not ponder the matter deeply ; like Felix , I put it off to a more convenient season . "" You say you have faults , Helen : what are they ? To me you seem very good . "" "" Then learn from me , not to judge by appearances : I am , as Miss Scatcherd said , slatternly ; I seldom put , and never keep , things , in order ; I am careless ; I forget rules ; I read when I should learn my lessons ; I have no method ; and sometimes I say , like you , I can not _bear_ to be subjected to systematic arrangements . This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd , who is naturally neat , punctual , and particular . "" "" And cross and cruel , "" I added ; but Helen Burns would not admit my addition : she kept silence . "" Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd ? "" At the utterance of Miss Temple's name , a soft smile flitted over her grave face . "" Miss Temple is full of goodness ; it pains her to be severe to any one , even the worst in the school : she sees my errors , and tells me of them gently ; and , if I do anything worthy of praise , she gives me my meed liberally . One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is , that even her expostulations , so mild , so rational , have not influence to cure me of my faults ; and even her praise , though I value it most highly , can not stimulate me to continued care and foresight . "" "" That is curious , "" said I , "" it is so easy to be careful . "" "" For _you_ I have no doubt it is . I observed you in your class this morning , and saw you were closely attentive : your thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you . Now , mine continually rove away ; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd , and collecting all she says with assiduity , often I lose the very sound of her voice ; I fall into a sort of dream . Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland , and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden , near our house ; -- then , when it comes to my turn to reply , I have to be awakened ; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook , I have no answer ready . "" "" Yet how well you replied this afternoon . "" "" It was mere chance ; the subject on which we had been reading had interested me . This afternoon , instead of dreaming of Deepden , I was wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did ; and I thought what a pity it was that , with his integrity and conscientiousness , he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown . If he had but been able to look to a distance , and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending ! Still , I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him , poor murdered king ! Yes , his enemies were the worst : they shed blood they had no right to shed . How dared they kill him ! "" Helen was talking to herself now : she had forgotten I could not very well understand her--that I was ignorant , or nearly so , of the subject she discussed . I recalled her to my level . "" And when Miss Temple teaches you , do your thoughts wander then ? "" "" No , certainly , not often ; because Miss Temple has generally something to say which is newer than my own reflections ; her language is singularly agreeable to me , and the information she communicates is often just what I wished to gain . "" "" Well , then , with Miss Temple you are good ? "" "" Yes , in a passive way : I make no effort ; I follow as inclination guides me . There is no merit in such goodness . "" "" A great deal : you are good to those who are good to you . It is all I ever desire to be . If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust , the wicked people would have it all their own way : they would never feel afraid , and so they would never alter , but would grow worse and worse . When we are struck at without a reason , we should strike back again very hard ; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again . "" "" You will change your mind , I hope , when you grow older : as yet you are but a little untaught girl . "" "" But I feel this , Helen ; I must dislike those who , whatever I do to please them , persist in disliking me ; I must resist those who punish me unjustly . It is as natural as that I should love those who show me affection , or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved . "" "" Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine , but Christians and civilised nations disown it . "" "" How ? I do n't understand . "" "" It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury . "" "" What then ? "" "" Read the New Testament , and observe what Christ says , and how He acts ; make His word your rule , and His conduct your example . "" "" What does He say ? "" "" Love your enemies ; bless them that curse you ; do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you . "" "" Then I should love Mrs. Reed , which I can not do ; I should bless her son John , which is impossible . "" In her turn , Helen Burns asked me to explain , and I proceeded forthwith to pour out , in my own way , the tale of my sufferings and resentments . Bitter and truculent when excited , I spoke as I felt , without reserve or softening . Helen heard me patiently to the end : I expected she would then make a remark , but she said nothing . "" Well , "" I asked impatiently , "" is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted , bad woman ? "" "" She has been unkind to you , no doubt ; because you see , she dislikes your cast of character , as Miss Scatcherd does mine ; but how minutely you remember all she has done and said to you ! What a singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart ! No ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings . Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity , together with the passionate emotions it excited ? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs . We are , and must be , one and all , burdened with faults in this world : but the time will soon come when , I trust , we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies ; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh , and only the spark of the spirit will remain , -- the impalpable principle of light and thought , pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature : whence it came it will return ; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory , from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph ! Surely it will never , on the contrary , be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend ? No ; I can not believe that : I hold another creed : which no one ever taught me , and which I seldom mention ; but in which I delight , and to which I cling : for it extends hope to all : it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home , not a terror and an abyss . Besides , with this creed , I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime ; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last : with this creed revenge never worries my heart , degradation never too deeply disgusts me , injustice never crushes me too low : I live in calm , looking to the end . "" Helen's head , always drooping , sank a little lower as she finished this sentence . I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me , but rather to converse with her own thoughts . She was not allowed much time for meditation : a monitor , a great rough girl , presently came up , exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent -- "" Helen Burns , if you do n't go and put your drawer in order , and fold up your work this minute , I 'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it ! "" Helen sighed as her reverie fled , and getting up , obeyed the monitor without reply as without delay ."	Prose/Lyrical
1509	"Tips for living with coyotes Thu July 25 , 2013 10 : 29pm Coyotes are part of the natural habitat in California , and they are increasingly adept at searching for food in cities because their natural habitat has increasingly been encroached by development . Coyote conflicts with humans are extremely rare , even though coyote activity is higher during this time of year as this is the season when they are raising their pups . If you walk your dog in or near any of the known coyote habitats , keep your dog on a leash at all times as required by municipal codes . If possible , avoid walking dogs in the early morning or at dusk , which are prime feeding times for coyotes . Keep small pets indoors , especially cats - they are an easy favored prey Coyotes and other predators may be attracted to areas that provide protective cover . Remove hiding spaces by keeping brush and weeds from around buildings cleared . Many coyotes have lost their natural fear of humans .

1223	"Defence review to see dozens of sites close The UK government will sell off 56 more defence sites by 2040 , the defence secretary has told MPs . Sir Michael Fallon said the sale of the sites - part of a review of Ministry of Defence land - was in addition to the sale of 35 MoD sites that had previously been announced . Unions called the plans "" brutal "" and promised to fight the closures . But Sir Michael said it would deliver better value for money and release enough land to build 55,000 homes . It is estimated that about Â£ 140m will be saved over the next decade by selling off the sites , which Sir Michael said would be reinvested in creating "" areas of military expertise "" in locations across the country . More than 32,000 acres of defence land will be released , including 10 surplus airfields and five golf courses . Fort George barracks to close in 2032 Three sites to be sold in Northern Ireland Brecon Barracks to close after 220 years "" By putting money where it is needed , we will provide better facilities to train our armed forces and deliver more stability for military families , "" he said , adding that the moves are part of a package of more than Â£ 4bn of investment in the services . The majority of sites will be in England , including parts of Catterick Garrison , North Yorkshire - the Army's largest garrison - the Prince William of Gloucester Barracks , near Grantham , and Imphal Barracks in York . A further eight sites in Scotland will close , including the Redford Calvary and Infantry Baracks in Edinburgh , and Fort George , near Ardersier . Then Wales and Northern Ireland will each have three bases closed , including Brecon Barracks . New sites and bases will be moved to locations which are selected based on employment opportunities in the community , enabling military families to buy their own homes and reducing disruption to children's education , Sir Michael said . These include new regional hubs for light infantry battalions in London , Edinburgh , Lisburn , St Athan , Blackpool and Cottesmore , as well as air assault forces in Colchester and a specialised infantry group in Aldershot . Defence secretary Michael Fallon said new sites would be chosen because of ' employment opportunities in the community ' Nia Griffith , shadow defence secretary , said Labour recognised there was "" a need to modernise "" the defence estate , but wanted reassurance families would be taken care of . She said : "" The government is right to seek to restructure the estate to ensure that we optimise our military capability and deliver value for money for the British taxpayer . "" The changes proposed in this report are very considerable in scale and there is a real need to ensure they are delivered in a way that does not cause undue challenges to our forces and their families . "" Ms Griffith also asked Sir Michael to confirm that all of the money raised would go back into defence and not into the Treasury . In reply , he said : "" All of the receipts , not some of them but all of the receipts , will come back in to the defence budget . "" ' Brutal programme ' But unions have said the cuts will severely hit the support for armed forces and damage morale . Mark Serwotka , general secretary for the Public and Commercial Services union , said : "" We are opposed to these closure plans that throw the future into doubt for thousands of staff . "" The MoD has a poor track record on selling off land for homes and this again exposes how the Tories are simply paying lip service to the urgent need to address the housing crisis . "" Mike McCartney , national officer for Unite , echoed the criticism , calling the closures "" brutal "" . "" In many instances the bases earmarked for closure are at the heart of their local communities providing a source of decent and secure employment , "" he said ."	News

60	"The Bremen town musicians There was once an ass whose master had made him carry sacks to the mill for many a long year , but whose strength began at last to fail , so that each day as it came found him less capable of work . Then his master began to think of turning him out , but the ass , guessing that something was in the wind that boded him no good , ran away , taking the road to Bremen ; for there he thought he might get an engagement as town musician . When he had gone a little way he found a hound lying by the side of the road panting , as if he had run a long way . "" Now , Holdfast , what are you so out of breath about ? "" said the ass . "" Oh dear ! "" said the dog , "" now I am old , I get weaker every day , and can do no good in the hunt , so , as my master was going to have me killed , I have made my escape ; but now , how am I to gain a living ? "" - "" I will tell you what , "" said the ass , "" I am going to Bremen to become town musician . You may as well go with me , and take up music too . I can play the lute , and you can beat the drum . "" And the dog consented , and they walked on together . It was not long before they came to a cat sitting in the road , looking as dismal as three wet days . "" Now then , what is the matter with you , old shaver ? "" said the ass . "" I should like to know who would be cheerful when his neck is in danger , "" answered the cat . "" Now that I am old my teeth are getting blunt , and I would rather sit by the oven and purr than run about after mice , and my mistress wanted to drown me ; so I took myself off ; but good advice is scarce , and I do not know what is to become of me . "" - "" Go with us to Bremen , "" said the ass , "" and become town musician . You understand serenading . "" The cat thought well of the idea , and went with them accordingly . After that the three travellers passed by a yard , and a cock was perched on the gate crowing with all his might . "" Your cries are enough to pierce bone and marrow , "" said the ass ; "" what is the matter ? "" - "" I have foretold good weather for Lady-day , so that all the shirts may be washed and dried ; and now on Sunday morning company is coming , and the mistress has told the cook that I must be made into soup , and this evening my neck is to be wrung , so that I am crowing with all my might while I can . "" - "" You had much better go with us , Chanticleer , "" said the ass . "" We are going to Bremen . At any rate that will be better than dying . You have a powerful voice , and when we are all performing together it will have a very good effect . "" So the cock consented , and they went on all four together . But Bremen was too far off to be reached in one day , and towards evening they came to a wood , where they determined to pass the night . The ass and the dog lay down under a large tree ; the cat got up among the branches , and the cock flew up to the top , as that was the safest place for him . Before he went to sleep he looked all round him to the four points of the compass , and perceived in the distance a little light shining , and he called out to his companions that there must be a house not far off , as he could see a light , so the ass said , "" We had better get up and go there , for these are uncomfortable quarters . "" The dog began to fancy a few bones , not quite bare , would do him good . And they all set off in the direction of the light , and it grew larger and brighter , until at last it led them to a robber's house , all lighted up . The ass . being the biggest , went up to the window , and looked in . "" Well , what do you see ? "" asked the dog . "" What do I see ? "" answered the ass ; "" here is a table set out with splendid eatables and drinkables , and robbers sitting at it and making themselves very comfortable . "" - "" That would just suit us , "" said the cock . "" Yes , indeed , I wish we were there , "" said the ass . Then they consulted together how it should be managed so as to get the robbers out of the house , and at last they hit on a plan . The ass was to place his forefeet on the window-sill , the dog was to get on the ass's back , the cat on the top of the dog , and lastly the cock was to fly up and perch on the cat's head . When that was done , at a given signal they all began to perform their music . The ass brayed , the dog barked , the cat mewed , and the cock crowed ; then they burst through into the room , breaking all the panes of glass . The robbers fled at the dreadful sound ; they thought it was some goblin , and fled to the wood in the utmost terror . Then the four companions sat down to table , made free with the remains of the meal , and feasted as if they had been hungry for a month . And when they had finished they put out the lights , and each sought out a sleeping-place to suit his nature and habits . The ass laid himself down outside on the dunghill , the dog behind the door , the cat on the hearth by the warm ashes , and the cock settled himself in the cockloft , and as they were all tired with their long journey they soon fell fast asleep . When midnight drew near , and the robbers from afar saw that no light was burning , and that everything appeared quiet , their captain said to them that he thought that they had run away without reason , telling one of them to go and reconnoitre . So one of them went , and found everything quite quiet ; he went into the kitchen to strike a light , and taking the glowing fiery eyes of the cat for burning coals , he held a match to them in order to kindle it . But the cat , not seeing the joke , flew into his face , spitting and scratching . Then he cried out in terror , and ran to get out at the back door , but the dog , who was lying there , ran at him and bit his leg ; and as he was rushing through the yard by the dunghill the ass struck out and gave him a great kick with his hind foot ; and the cock , who had been wakened with the noise , and felt quite brisk , cried out , "" Cock-a-doodle-doo ! "" Then the robber got back as well as he could to his captain , and said , "" Oh dear ! in that house there is a gruesome witch , and I felt her breath and her long nails in my face ; and by the door there stands a man who stabbed me in the leg with a knife ; and in the yard there lies a black spectre , who beat me with his wooden club ; and above , upon the roof , there sits the justice , who cried , ' Bring that rogue here ! ' And so I ran away from the place as fast as I could . "" From that time forward the robbers never ventured to that house , and the four Bremen town musicians found themselves so well off where they were , that there they stayed . And the person who last related this tale is still living , as you see ."	Prose/Lyrical

1663	"Quimby is an alternative rock band popular on the Hungarian music scene . Enjoying large crowds across the nation , they have had successes at music festivals such as the Sziget Festival . Together for over 25 years , the band has a large collection of studio albums and one live CD / DVD combo to their credit . The band originated in the industrial town of DunaÃºjvÃ¡ros under the name ' OktÃ³ber ' , playing covers . By the end of high school , the band dispersed . The Kiss brothers , Tibor and Endre , got another group together in 1991 , and renamed it ' Quimby ' . 1991 to 1995 : Saloon start - Jerrycan Dance In 1992 the band's first cassette entitled Up Side Down was made available , featuring English-language tunes like "" Sea , "" "" Stink , "" "" I Give You My Shoes , "" "" Up Side Down , "" "" Never Get By , "" and "" Policeman "" . The band's style was compared to the chansons and cabaret songs from the period between the World Wars . The band played at pubs in Pest . By 1993 the personnel consisted of Tibor Kiss ( vocals and guitar ) , Endre Kiss ( guitar ) , Livius Varga ( percussion and vocals ) , TamÃ¡s SzÃ©n MolnÃ¡r ( saxophone ) , Ferenc Mikuli ( bass guitar ) , and Ãkos Medve ( drums ) . In 1993 they recorded their second album , Sip of Story . This album also came out on cassette and had English lyrics . During this period the band was one of the most successful club bands in Budapest , and also popular on the college and festival circuit . At this point the elder Kiss brother , Endre , left the band . He was replaced by a young piano player , SzilÃ¡rd Balanyi , who was born in BalatonfÃ¼red . With this new line-up the band recorded its next album , Jerrycan Dance , which came out on CD but in a limited edition . This album is also in English and it begins to show some of the main characteristics which are seen in the present band . 1995 to 1997 : Language change - Majom-tangÃ³ In 1995 , the band decided to focus more on writing songs in Hungarian . By the summer of 1996 the new album was finished : Majom-tangÃ³ ( Monkey Tango ) . This album contains mostly Hungarian songs , but there are three English ones . The album has an eclectic style : there are several folk songs featured in the usual chanson-epic style of Quimby , especially Roma and Latin folk music ; then reggae and psychedelic effects are incorporated . Majom-tangÃ³ is the direct antecedent of their present style . The release of Majom-tangÃ³ immediately led to a rise in popularity on the Hungarian music scene . The band moved from being a phenomenon on the alternative stage to wider popularity with the appearance of Diligramm ( Loonygramme ) in December 1997 . Diligramm is a complete work of a mature band . The lyrics are crisper , the musical palette more colorful ; the band found its own style . The CD was introduced by a video and single , "" Once There Was a Time "" , and by a memorable CD release concert . Quimby enjoyed many successes in their live performances , with more concerts in front of larger audiences . In the spring of 1998 the Hungarian press chose Diligramm the album of the year . The new album ÃkszerelmÃ©re was highly anticipated even before it was released in November 1999 . Producing the record proved a little complex when early in the year Livius Varga lost the tape containing the ideas of for new songs while he was traveling on the tram in Budapest . ÃkszerelmÃ©re is even more mature and composed than the previous album . The music is strict but playful , uniform but discursive , realistic but ascendent , and traditionalist . While the band uses the implementations of modern music , the lyrics are cruel and ironic ; stories and verbal psychedelia are present . After the recording of ÃkszerelmÃ©re the band released TamÃ¡s MolnÃ¡r ( saxophone ) . After a long search his place was filled by JÃ³zsef KÃ¡rpÃ¡ti , a trumpet and piano player from the band ' Andersen ' . The band stepped on stage at that year's Sziget Festival in this form . During this period the band performed at festival concerts in Hungary and abroad , and went on a mini-tour of Germany . In the spring of 2001 Quimby released a new album called MorzsÃ¡k Ã©s SzilÃ¡nkok ( Crumbs and Splinters ) . It contained remixes featuring unknown , young , talented remixers , together with concert recordings of older songs . Tibor Kiss singer said the album presented the material "" with a sort of continuous modality , like a film , building upon each other one after the other "" . In 2002 , the album called KÃ¡osz Amigos ( Chaos Amigos ) did not disappoint fans . The album takes the musical oeuvre of Quimby to a new point of view . It is a musical-lyrical adventure in a troubled , intensive , vibrating , sensitive , dynamic , tragic , humorous , often tragicomic world . This album contains 10 songs in 43 minutes . In spite of the shorter playtime the album is a colorful , exciting and amusing musical roller-coaster . The songs are memorable but not hits in the usual sense . There are Spanish-like chansons with stiff rhythms , interesting guitar work , agile and bop songs . There are also fancy , moderate , slow songs and rap , even childhood sayings . The album features percussion instruments , guitar , bass , keyboards , modern electronics and trumpet by the newest member of the band , JÃ³zsef KÃ¡rpÃ¡ti . The band had just completed touring the new album in Hungary when frontman Tibor Kiss needed an extended break for rest and relaxation , so the band went on hiatus . Though its was n't known ahead of time how long the break would be , the pause lasted until 2004 . After an intensive probation period and a return concert , Quimby rejoined the Hungarian public music scene once again with enormous power . Full-house concerts were held in Budapest and other venues , along with a successful "" Night Invasion "" concert in Spring 2004 and appearances at the big summer festivals , including the Sziget Festival . The band continued from where they left off : reviewers and fans said the band was in good shape , perhaps even better than before . 2005 to present : KilÃ©gzÃ©s and Family TugedÃ¶r The album KilÃ©gzÃ©s ( Exhalation , October 2005 ) became an important work in the band's history . It is an interesting milestone because it opened a new era from an artistic point of view . Memories from their previous phase are presented in a new context , in a re-evaluated form . Tibor Kiss does n't mince now , there is no nostalgia , no great truths revealed , but only the music with its ironic , emotional , expressive style . In 2006 the band reached the 15-year milestone . Quimby celebrated this special jubilee by publishing a greatest hits recording and DVD called Family TugedÃ¶r . They also gave a double concert in the Katona JÃ³zsef Theatre , one in the PetÅfi Csarnok venue and a concert on 1 January 2007 called "" Magic Music "" . The work continues with two releases in 2009 , an EP ( Ajjajjaj ) and a full length album ( LÃ¡rmagyÅ±jtÃ¶getÅ ) ."	Information/Explanation

Steven Raichlen has several recipe books that contain hundreds of ideas for the dedicated grill master . In a pinch , or when you do n't live in the same town as Dad , cards and gift certificates to favorite restaurants or stores do the trick . The most important thing to keep in mind about Father's Day gifts is that they should be reflections of your relationship with Dad . They do n't have to be expensive to be meaningful . It 's also great to find ways to get the kids involved . Homemade cards and crafts from younger kids are sure to be treasured presents ( yes , even cards covered in dried macaroni ! ) . Does Dad hate mowing the lawn ? Teens who are short on cash can pledge to do extra chores ( cleaning their room does n't count ) . And whether the day has been well planned or it 's the eleventh hour , do n't forget to give Dad a hug ( or a call ) and actually say , "" Happy Father's Day ! """	Instruction
644	"Dear Ishmael Please may I thank you for the children's celebration on Wednesday ( ? ) of Week 1 of Spring Harvest this year : the celebration at which you and others prayed for healing for those there . I was there and I was healed . I have n't told anyone about this yet , because for the past couple of weeks I 've been too scared to hope that it could really be true . But it is . I was standing at the back , because a botched operation on my knee when I was 13 had left me with a weak right leg and a small degree of disability . All that standing up and sitting down the previous couple of evenings had been a bit too much . I was also feeling fairly vulnerable , because I 'd just had a row with my chalet-mates . God uses some strange ways to prepare us for meeting Him . One person spoke about depression , and I wondered if that could be for me , but it did n't feel ' right ' - I 've suffered from depression , but am coping with it quite well right now . Then ( I think it was ) you said that someone had a pain , or a problem , with their right leg . And what I heard was , "" Jesus wants to heal you . "" Jesus actually WANTS to heal me . I do n't think anyone saw but I just stood at the back of the room and could n't stop the tears pouring out . I do n't have the words to describe what I felt , or how I fell now in remembering it , but I was completely overwhelmed . I walked out of the room , to go to the Big Top celebration , limping as I usually do â and then I realised that I did n't need to limp . I tried out walking like other people walk â and I was walking evenly , and without pain . I was so scared I almost went straight back to the chalet , to hide . I do n't know from what . After the celebration I walked through the site , not wanting to go ' home ' â just wanting to walk , to see if I could make it hurt again . I could n't . I work out at the gym a lot , on medical advice ( I certainly do n't torture myself for fun ! ) . Walking the treadmill has been agony â I 've simply had to work through the pain , because it 's something I am required to do by my doctor . Since getting back from Spring Harvest , I 've been to the gym almost every day , and have never once felt any of the pain I used to live with all the time . My right leg is weak and gets tired , but I can see even that starting to change now . THERE IS NO MORE PAIN ! I 'm still frightened to believe it , in case it turns out not to be true . But it is true , is n't it ? Which is why I want to thank you , in completely inadequate words . After 29 years , I can walk freely again . I am not a good person ( I have some nasty stuff in my past that Jeff , who is surely one of the kindest and most compassionate people I 've ever met , is helping me sort out ) , but Jesus has stepped right into where it hurt and He has healed me . I do n't understand it â I certainly do n't deserve it â but it 's happened . I think I 've caught a glimpse of what Paul means when he talks about praising God continually . I suppose I should tell people , but I do n't know how . I 'm afraid they wo n't believe me â my disability was not always particularly marked . But I know it 's true , and my gratitude to Jesus is without measure . I do n't know yet how to thank Him , but I shall find a way . Thank you as well . Thank you so much ."	Opinion/Argumentation
194	Second regular session 2002 23 to 27 September 2002 , New York Item 7 of the provisional agenda UNOPS : Financial , budgetary and administrative matters Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Executive Director of the United Nations Office for Project Services on the implementation of the revised budget for 2002 , on the revised budget estimates for the biennium 2002-2003 and on the level of the operational reserve ( DP / 2002 / 33 ) . The Committee also had before it , as background documentation , a conference room paper on UNOPS revised budget estimates for the year 2002 ( DP / 2002 / CRP . 10 ) , a report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors for the biennium 2000-2001 ( DP / 2002 / 35 ) , an action plan on savings from projected staff cuts ( DP / 2002 / 35 / Add . 1 ) , an advance copy of the UNOPS contingency plan for 2002-2003 ( DP / 2002 / 35 / Add . 2 ) and draft terms of reference and timetable for an independent review of UNOPS ( DP / 2002 / 36 ) . During its consideration of these matters , the Committee met with the Executive Director of UNOPS and his colleagues , who provided additional information . The Advisory Committee notes that the projection of income and expenditures of UNOPS during the biennium 2002-2003 has taken place under circumstances that have seriously impacted on the working of that Office . The Advisory Committee notes with concern the serious situation facing the management and operation of UNOPS . The Committee was informed that the massive reduction of business from UNDP that started in 1999 continued during the biennium 2000-2001 and the year 2002 ( see annex 1 to this report ) . Income from UNDP decreased from $ 79 . 4 million in the biennium 1998-1999 ( or some 92 percent of total project income of UNOPS ) to $ 61 . 5 million in the biennium 2000-2001 ( or 82 percent of total project income ) . However , UNDP remains UNOPS ' largest client since the latter's inception in 1994 ( see report of the Board of Auditors to the General Assembly on the accounts of UNOPS for the biennium ended 31 December 2001 , para . 25 and Annex 2 to this report ) . The Advisory Committee was informed that the UNOPS ' delivery dropped considerably in 2001 and consequently its income from project delivery . The budget approved for 2001 ( Executive Board decision 2001 / 19 ) projected a total income of $ 56 . 8 million and total administrative expenditures of $ 55 . 3 million . Actual income for 2001 amounted however to only $ 47 . 2 million or $ 9 . 6 million less than the projected income . Administrative expenditures totaled $ 52 . 8 million , exceeding total income by $ 5 . 6 million . UNOPS covered this shortfall in income through a drawdown on the operational reserve , in accordance with its Financial Regulations , reducing its level to $ 5 million ( DP / 2002 / CRP . 10 ) . The Advisory Committee was also informed that the performance of UNOPS in 2001 was significantly affected , inter alia , by the uncertainty about its future status . The review by the Secretary-General on the operations and continuity of UNOPS , requested in March 2001 , was completed in January 2002 when the Secretary-General took the decision to maintain UNOPS as a separate and identifiable entity of the United Nations system that is self-financing , as originally intended by Member States . The Committee was provided with the note of the Secretary-General on the matter ( DP / 2002 / CRP . 5 ) . The Committee notes that in reaching its decision , the Secretary-General was assisted by the internal review carried out , at his request , by the Office of Internal Oversight Services ( OIOS ) . The Committee recalls that in paragraph 4 of its report DP / 2001 / 29 of 5 September 2001 , it indicated that it was incumbent on the Secretary-General to inform Member States expeditiously on the results of the review . The Committee reiterates its request that the Secretary-General make available to Member States the report of OIOS on UNOPS . Furthermore , the Advisory Committee believes that , in supporting the continued work of UNOPS , as a separate and identifiable entity that provides services to organizations of the United Nations system for the management and delivery of programmes and projects , it is incumbent upon the Secretary-General to take steps to ensure the viability and success of UNOPS . The Advisory Committee recalls that it had also expressed its concern that the prolonged deliberations regarding the future status of UNOPS would have negative impact on its operations , resulting in lower levels of acquisition and delivery ( DP / 2001 / 29 , para . The Committee was informed that during 2001 the uncertainty regarding the existence of UNOPS had led to a decrease in UNOPS ' key businesses , including cancellation or delays of approved project budgets funded by UNDP in an amount of $ 42 million . The Advisory Committee is concerned that , through no fault of UNOPS , it has not been able to recover fully from UNDP the costs of activities carried out in good faith , with a view to performing the tasks specified in the work plans of approved projects which were subsequently delayed , modified , or cancelled . The Committee recalls that , with respect to the termination or postponement of project budgets , it had indicated that this should be managed through consultation of all parties concerned and in such a way as to minimize the financial consequences and their impact on UNOPS ( DP / 2001 / 29 , para . In this connection , the Committee recommends that the Administrator of UNDP review the issue so as to reimburse UNOPS in an equitable manner for the costs incurred . ( See paragraph . 9 below . The Advisory Committee notes that the Secretary-General decided to maintain the Management Coordination Committee ( MCC ) , chaired by the UNDP Administrator ( see DP / 2002 / CRP . 5 , paras . 7 to 15 ) . The Committee has indicated that the relationships of UNOPS with the entities involved in governing , servicing and advising it are complex and that , at times , may hinder the effective communication and reporting systems of UNOPS ( DP / 1994 / 57 , paras . 3 and 4 ) . In the Committee's opinion , the responsibilities currently assigned to the MCC appear to establish another layer of executive management for UNOPS ; as initially endorsed by the Executive Board , the MCC was established to provide overall oversight and guidance to UNOPS , as a self-financing entity . The Committee was informed that actions taken by the MCC in management of UNOPS have resulted , at times , in unnecessary and costly delays . For example , the Committee was informed that , in the last quarter of 2001 , it had become clear that expenditure reductions on non-staff related items would not be sufficient to balance the budget . Both the approved budget and the staffing strength of UNOPS were in excess of the income that was being generated . Had the MCC agreed with staff reduction measures in November 2001 rather than in February 2002 , the downward adjustment would have been less painful and savings in 2002 could have been larger . With regard to budget for 2002 , the Advisory Committee was informed that in June 2002 , the Management Coordination Committee ( MCC ) decided to revise the approved budget of $ 56 . 5 million downward to a ceiling of $ 44 million . The 2002 revised budget is based on business already acquired but excluding new business in the advanced pipeline that would be signed and implemented during the course of the year . The Advisory Committee remains concerned that the Executive Director of UNOPS has not been given the flexibility needed to manage the organization to react to changes in the fluctuations in delivery of the project portfolio and other services . In this connection , the Committee recalls its comments on the role of the MCC made in its report of 7 October 1994 ( DP / 1994 / 57 , paras . 13 and 14 ) and reiterates its recommendation made in its report of 18 September 2000 ( DP / 2000 / 38 , para . 18 ) on the need to streamline the budget preparation and review process . To this end , the current role of the MCC in setting a budgetary ceiling should be reconsidered with a view to conforming the procedure for the preparation and submission of the UNOPS budget to that followed by the UN Funds and Programmes . The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of document DP / 2002 / 36 that the scope of the proposed independent review of UNOPS would include a review of the revenue and cost structures of UNOPS , its operating margins on products and services , as well as its business processes and management tools at hand . The Committee notes that the estimated cost of this review amounts to $ 200 , 000 and would be completed in 90 days . The Committee welcomes this review , which is in line with its recommendations in paragraphs 2 and 3 of its report DP / 2001 / 29 of 5 September 2001 . The Committee stresses that although UNOPS should continue its efforts to be a cost-effective and competitive provider of services to clients within the United Nations system , it should recover in full from its clients the actual costs of executing projects and providing services . The Committee also reiterates its view that UNOPS should continue its efforts to examine the structure of its business with a view to refining the criteria taken into account to evaluate the commitment of clients and UNOPS ' own capacity to deliver . To ensure an expeditious completion of the independent review , the Secretary-General should make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its costs are met . The Advisory Committee notes that , in document DP / 2002 / 35 / Add . 2 , an attempt has been made to formulate a contingency plan for UNOPS in response to Executive Board decision 2002 / 13 . The plan includes actions to be taken by the Executive Director in the event that the operational reserve is unable to absorb administrative expenditures incurred against the UNOPS account for the biennium 2002-2003 . In the Committee's opinion some of the steps proposed in paragraphs 9 to 14 to increase income and reduce administrative expenditure are already within the purview of management authority of the Executive Director of UNOPS and do not necessarily form part of a contingency plan related to the level operational reserve . Moreover , some of the proposed actions should also be closely examined in the proposed internal review of UNOPS ( see paragraph 9 above ) . These would include , for example , the question of the rights and obligations of UNOPS and its clients pursuant to contractual arrangements for project delivery ( see paragraph 5 above ) . On the question of the future status of UNDP personnel working with UNOPS and respective liabilities of UNDP and UNOPS the Advisory Committee was informed that the prevalence of staff in UNOPS with differences in contractual status hampers UNOPS ' ability to be responsive to the self-financing principle . Categories include UNDP permanent staff expected to return to UNDP , UNDP staff with contracts limited to UNOPS , and UNOPS staff . In addition , the personnel arrangements with UNDP of 1994 are no longer valid and UNOPS has agreed with UNDP to revise them in order to fit their current and future anticipated relationship . UNDP and UNOPS have agreed on a cost-sharing formula applicable to UNDP staff that have been serving with UNOPS and need to be separated as a result of abolition of posts . However , UNDP's precarious financial situation has led UNDP to take certain decisions that are not reciprocal to that which is expected from UNOPS . The Advisory Committee has commented in the past on the need to re-examine UNOPS contracts for personnel services in order to have a flexible post management system that would allow UNOPS to expand and contract its capacity in response to changes in demand and project delivery and income . The Committee has also recognized that the demand for UNOPS services is increasingly calling for specialized capacity for the management of multi-disciplinary initiatives and that UNOPS must respond quickly , efficiently and in the most cost-effective manner ( see , for example , DP / 2000 / 38 , paras . 14 to 17 ) . The Committee trusts that the internal review of UNOPS will include the re-examination of these personnel issues . Implementation of the approved budget for 2002 In its decision 2002 / 13 , paragraph 6 , the Executive Board approved the 2002 administrative budget in the amount of $ 44 million on the basis of a total income projected at $ 44 . 3 million and a project delivery portfolio of $ 503 . 2 million . The Committee notes that at the end of July 2002 , project delivery had reached $ 320 . 4 million , generating income in the amount of $ 22 . 5 million . Total income , including service income for loan administration , was $ 26 . 9 million and administrative expenditure amounted to $ 26 . 4 million at the end of July 2002 ( DP / 2002 / 33 , paras . 3 to 6 ) . The Advisory Committee was informed that the latest available figures indicate that UNOPS is on track or even slightly ahead on delivery and income ; however , staff related costs have increased about 7.5 per cent as compared with the pro-forma costs used in the budget , as a result mainly of currency fluctuations of the dollar vis-a-vis the Euro and other currencies . This situation may lead to overspending the approved administrative budget by some $ 250 , 000 , or one half of one percent of the approved budget , if measures for further cost containment and possible additional income turn out to be insufficient to compensate for this cost escalation in the personnel component of the budget . Revised budget estimates for 2003 The Advisory Committee was informed that , for 2003 , the MCC had initially set a revised target of $ 41 million , expressed in 2002 dollars ( as compared with approved total of $ 56 . 5 million . ) Given the increases for staff related costs and the need to set aside $ 1 million for a post-IMIS business information system , the MCC approved a budget ceiling for 2003 at the same level as for 2002 of $ 44 million . The budget submitted by the Executive Director of UNOPS amounts to $ 43 . 9 million and is based on the assumption that the delivery of project portfolio will amount to $ 513 million , reflecting an increase $ 9 . 8 million or 1.9 per cent over the estimate for 2002 of $ 503 . 2 million . Total income is projected at $ 44 . 7 million , comprising $ 36 . 4 million from project delivery , $ 6 . 9 million from service income , including services provided to IFAD , and $ 1 . 4 million from other income , including income from existing and planned agreements with a number of United Nations organizations for the subletting of office space and the provision of associated services at UNOPS headquarters ( DP / 2002 / 33 , paras . 12 to 17 and table 1 ) . The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 16 of document DP / 2002 / 33 that the need to invest in information technology in the amount of $ 1 million in 2003 is a consequence of the decision by UNDP to implement a new Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) system , effective 1 January 2004 . The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the budget proposal of the Executive Director for 2003 . The level of the operational reserve As indicated in paragraph 3 above , at the end of the biennium 2000-2001 , the operational reserve was reduced to $ 5 . 0 million . The direct charge to the operational reserve to cover estimated staff separation in 2002 is estimated at $ 2 million ( DP / 2002 / 33 , para . 18 and table 1 ) . A total of 44 staff members have been affected by the staff reduction exercise in 2002 ( see DP / 2002 / 35 / Add . 1 , para . 8 and table 1 ) . In light of the estimated over-expenditure of $ 250 , 000 in 2002 ( see paragraph 13 above ) and the projected excess of income over expenditure of $ 800 , 000 in 2003 , the Committee was informed that the operational reserve level would amount to some $ 3 . 5 million by the end of 2003 . However , in 2003 and 2004 UNOPS medium-term strategy also foresees subletting one fourth of its office space in 2003 and one half from 2004 onwards , allowing the organization to generate additional income , as a result of staff reductions and decentralization measures to move operations to lower cost duty stations . * ) Since 1997 , has included an increasing number of Management Services Agreements negotiated with non-UN funding sources such as International Financial Institutions and governments , where UNDP assumes the function of funds manager and UNOPS is charged with execution .

"" The Saw - Horse would probably have paid no attention to this , but just then it stepped a leg into a gopher-hole and stumbled head-over-heels to the ground , where it lay upon its back , frantically waving its four legs in the air . Tip ran up to it . "" You 're a nice sort of a horse , I must say ! "" he exclaimed . "" Why did n't you stop when I yelled ' whoa ? ' "" "" Does ' whoa ' mean to stop ?

"" "" You 're upside down , "" explained Tip . "" But just keep those legs still a minute and I 'll set you right side up again . "" "" How many sides have I ? "" asked the creature , wonderingly . "" Several , "" said Tip , briefly . "" But do keep those legs still . "" The Saw-Horse now became quiet , and held its legs rigid ; so that Tip , after several efforts , was able to roll him over and set him upright . "" Ah , I seem all right now , "" said the queer animal , with a sigh . "" One of your ears is broken , "" Tip announced , after a careful examination . "" I 'll have to make a new one . "" Then he led the Saw-Horse back to where Jack was vainly struggling to regain his feet , and after assisting the Pumpkinhead to stand upright Tip whittled out a new ear and fastened it to the horse's head . 54 "" Now , "" said he , addressing his steed , "" pay attention to what I 'm going to tell you . ' Whoa ! ' means to stop ; ' Get-Up ! ' means to walk forward ; ' Trot ! ' means to go as fast as you can . Understand ? "" "" I believe I do , "" returned the horse . "" Very good . We are all going on a journey to the Emerald City , to see His Majesty , the Scarecrow ; and Jack Pumpkinhead is going to ride on your back , so he wo n't wear out his joints .

1375	This year Michael Brandvold Marketing has founded the Are You Listening Social Media Award . This is awarded to the person or business who has missed the boat the most when it comes to social media . This is not for the person or company who has not even setup social profiles , this is for the person or business that has profiles but has completely missed how to use them . They have completely missed the opportunity to engage with their fans or customers . One condition on winning the award , you have to give the award back if you actually become aware you won because you were following social media . Because he is completely absent from all conversation about him and his band the 2011 Are You Listening Social Media Award is presented to ... Kip Winger ! What did Kip Winger not do to get this award ? In June of 2011 at the Conclave radio conference , a annual gathering of radio and music industry professionals , Winger was mentioned during a presentation . Following the presentation Winger took on a life and was being mentioned throughout the entire day in many Tweets . Not one acknowledgement by Winger . This was a gathering of a radio and music professionals remember . Six months later a number of professionals are still talking about Winger , but now joking how he is absent ... where is Kip Winger ? Still not one acknowledgement by Winger . I tried to reach out to him via his Twitter and Facebook page , no response . Six months ago he had the opportunity to engage with industry professionals , now he is being given a award to recognize his failure .	Opinion/Argumentation
276	What is a relational database ? A relational database consists of two or more tables whose records are related to each other . The relationship is created by linking a field in one table with a field in another table . Both these fields must be exactly the same datatype . In one of the tables it must be a Primary Key . Key fields are the heart of relational database management . The value in a key field uniquely identifies a particular occurrence of a given record type . For example a customer record might have a key field called Account and a particular customer's Account field might have a value of 123 to distinguish it from others . Storing copies of the value 123 in order records generated by that customer lets us relate the customers and order records . Only one customer record can have an account number of 123 but many order records can have the value 123 , relating them to the same customer . This is called a one-to-many relationship . The golden rule of relational database design : Never store the same information twice unless there is a very good reason The advantage of a relational database is that there is no more duplication , other than the link fields . The following diagram illustrates this . The Primary Keys for each table are in blue . ( Only a few fields are shown . ) Looking at the customers table , if we want to know more about the rep for each customer , all the data is contained in the Sales Rep table . The sales rep for customer accounts 123 and 124 is AJ and this links to the Primary key AJ in the sales Rep table , so we see his name is Andy Jordan . If we want to know what orders Ronalds has placed , the details can be found in the orders table , linked via the Primary Key Accounts . Relationships in Access Let us see how Access displays relationships . Lets also use an application which you may have had experience of yourself - a library . Here are the relationships in a simple library system . How it works There are two basic tables in a library - the Books table contains all the details of the books in the library . If there a many copies of a book , then only way you can tell them apart is the Accession Number . This is the Primary Key for the table . The second table is the Members table . This contains all the details about the members . There may be two people with the same name etc. so a different membership number is assigned to each member . This is the Primary Key for this table . These two tables become linked , when you take out a book , by means of a third table - the Transaction table . This assigns a separate number to every transaction . This is the Primary Key for this table . When you go to a library all you do is give the librarian your library card ( which has a barcode number on it ) . The librarian scans the card and scans the barcode on the book you are taking out . The two numbers are being linked together in this transaction . The computer assigns the day's date and the number of the transaction . This completes a new record in the transaction table . If they need to find out your phone number , the link will take them to the Members table and your record . If they need to find out the title of the book you took out , the link will take them to the Books table and the record for that book . Imagine how long it would take if they had to write down your details and the book details ( or even just the name and the title of the book ) every time ! How to set up relationships Firstly , you must plan the tables very carefully . It is essential that each table contains a Primary Key The fields to be related are the same datatype and the same format Once you have created your tables you should set up the relationships before you enter any data . It can be done later , but there are often problems with data not matching etc. If the relationships are created first , the computer will not allow you to enter data that breaks the rules .

1639	Association of Indian Universities ( AIU ) is an organisation and association of major universities in India . It is based in Delhi . It evaluates the courses , syllabi , standards and credits of foreign Universities pursued abroad and equates them in relation to various courses offered by Indian Universities . The AIU is mainly concerned with the recognition of Degrees / Diplomas awarded by the Universities in India , which are recognized by the University Grants Commission , New Delhi , and abroad for the purpose of admission to higher degree courses in Indian Universities . The AIU is also an implementing agency for the agreements signed under the Cultural Exchange Programmes executed between India and other countries in the field of education , insofar as it relates to the recognition of foreign qualifications ( except for medicine and allied courses ) . Its opinion as to legitimacy or recognition of any foreign qualification is not binding upon anyone , as it is neither a statutory body , nor a part of the government . It is in fact a society registered under the societies act . UK Master's programmes are not recognized by the AIU for the reason that they are of one-year duration .

88	"Alleged war criminal Radovan KaradÅ¾iÄ caught in Serbia Tuesday , July 22 , 2008 Radovan KaradÅ¾iÄ Alleged war criminal Radovan KaradÅ¾iÄ was caught yesterday in Serbia by Serbian security forces after almost 13 years on the run from authorities . Last night he was questioned by an inquisitor of the War Crimes Court in Belgrade . KaradÅ¾iÄ has been accused by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Bosnian War from 1992 to 1995 . The Srebrenica massacre , in which about 8,000 Muslims were killed , is among the most serious of his alleged crimes . The massacre was categorised as genocide by both the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia . Internationally , the arrest was unanimously welcomed . Along with former military chief Ratko MladiÄ , KaradÅ¾iÄ has been one of the most sought-after war criminals of the Balkan conflict . Described by the BBC's Kate Adie as a "" smart , rather vain man "" , his capture found him with a long white beard working in a clinic and practicing alternative medicine under the name Dragan Dabic ."

Unplug the Apple USB Power Adapter if any of the following conditions exist : The power cord or plug has become frayed or damaged . The adapter is exposed to rain , liquid , or excessive moisture . The adapter case has become damaged . You suspect the adapter needs service or repair . You want to clean the adapter . Avoiding Hearing Damage Permanent hearing loss may occur if the receiver , earbuds , headphones , speakerphone , or earpieces are used at high volume . Set the volume to a safe level . You can adapt over time to a higher volume of sound that may sound normal but can be damaging to your hearing . If you experience ringing in your ears or muffled speech , stop listening and have your hearing checked . The louder the volume , the less time is required before your hearing could be affected . Hearing experts suggest that to protect your hearing : Limit the amount of time you use the receiver , earbuds , headphones , speakerphone , or earpieces at high volume . Avoid turning up the volume to block out noisy surroundings . Turn the volume down if you ca n't hear people speaking near you . For information about how to set a maximum volume limit on iPhone , see the iPhone User Guide . Emergency Calls You should not rely on wireless devices for essential communications , such as medical emergencies . Use of iPhone to call emergency services may not work in all locations or all operating conditions . Emergency numbers and services vary by region , and sometimes an emergency call can not be placed due to network availability or environmental interference . Some cellular networks may not accept an emergency call from iPhone if it does not have a SIM , if the SIM is PIN-locked , or if you have not activated your iPhone . Driving and Riding Safely Use of iPhone alone or with headphones ( even if used only in one ear ) while driving a vehicle or riding a bicycle is not recommended and is illegal in some areas . Check and obey the laws and regulations on the use of mobile devices like iPhone in the areas where you drive or ride . Be careful and attentive while driving or riding a bicycle . If you decide to use iPhone while driving , keep in mind the following guidelines : 1 Give full attention to driving or riding and to the road . Using a mobile device while driving or riding may be distracting . If you find it disruptive or distracting while operating any type of vehicle , riding a bicycle , or performing any activity that requires your full attention , pull off the road and park before making or answering a call . Get to know iPhone and its features such as Voice Control , Favorites , Recents , and Speaker . These features help you to place your call without taking your attention off the road . See the iPhone User Guide for more information . Use a hands-free device . Take advantage of one of the many compatible hands-free accessories available for use with iPhone . Use of a hands-free device may be required in some areas . Position iPhone within easy reach . Keep your eyes on the road . If you get an incoming call at an inconvenient time , let your voicemail answer it for you . Try to plan calls when your car will be stationary . Assess the traffic before dialing , or place calls when you are not moving or before pulling into traffic . Let the person you are speaking with know you are driving . If necessary , suspend the call in heavy traffic or hazardous weather conditions . Driving in rain , sleet , snow , ice , fog , and even heavy traffic can be hazardous . Do not text , email , take notes , look up phone numbers , or perform any other activities that require your attention while driving . Composing or reading texts and emails , jotting down a to-do list , or flipping through your address book takes attention away from your primary responsibility , driving safely . Do not engage in stressful or emotional conversations that may be distracting . Make people you are talking with aware you are driving and suspend conversations that have the potential to divert your attention from the road . Navigating Safely Do not rely on iPhone applications that provide maps , digital compass headings , orientation information , directions , or location-based navigation to determine precise locations , proximity , orientation , distance , or direction . These applications should only be used for basic navigation assistance . Maps , directions , and location-based applications depend on data services . These data services are subject to change and may not be available in all geographic areas , resulting in maps , digital compass headings , directions or location-based information that may be unavailable , inaccurate , or incomplete . iPhone contains an internal digital compass located in the upper-right corner of iPhone . The accuracy of digital compass headings may be negatively affected by magnetic or other environmental interference , including interference caused by the close proximity of the magnets contained in the iPhone earbuds . Never rely solely on the digital compass for determining direction . Compare the information provided on iPhone to your surroundings and defer to posted signs to resolve any discrepancies . Do not use location-based applications while performing activities that require your full attention . For important information about driving safety , see the "" Driving and Riding Safely "" section . Always comply with posted signs and the laws and regulations in the areas where you are using iPhone . For Vehicles Equipped with an Air Bag An air bag inflates with great force . Do not store iPhone or any of its accessories in the area over the air bag or in the air bag deployment area . Seizures , Blackouts , and Eyestrain A small percentage of people may be susceptible to blackouts or seizures ( even if they have never had one before ) when exposed to flashing lights or light patterns such as when playing games or watching video . If you have experienced seizures or blackouts or have a family history of such occurrences , you should consult a physician before playing games ( if available ) or watching videos on your iPhone . Discontinue use of iPhone and consult a physician if you experience headaches , blackouts , seizures , convulsion , eye or muscle twitching , loss of awareness , involuntary movement , or disorientation . To reduce risk of headaches , blackouts , seizures , and eyestrain , avoid prolonged use , hold iPhone some distance from your eyes , use iPhone in a well-lit room , and take frequent breaks . Choking Hazards iPhone contains small parts , which may present a choking hazard to small children . Keep iPhone and its accessories away from small children . Repetitive Motion When you perform repetitive activities such as typing or playing games on iPhone , you may experience occasional discomfort in your hands , arms , shoulders , neck , or other parts of your body . Take frequent breaks and if you have discomfort during or after such use , stop use and see a physician . Potentially Explosive Atmospheres Turn off iPhone ( press and hold the Sleep / Wake button , and then slide the onscreen slider ) when in any area with a potentially explosive atmosphere . Do not charge iPhone , and obey all signs and instructions . Sparks in such areas could cause an explosion or fire , resulting in serious injury or even death . Areas with a potentially explosive atmosphere are often , but not always , marked clearly . Potential areas may include : fueling areas ( such as gas stations ) ; below deck on boats ; fuel or chemical transfer or storage facilities ; vehicles using liquefied petroleum gas ( such as propane or butane ) ; areas where the air contains chemicals or particles ( such as grain , dust , or metal powders ) ; and any other area where you would normally be advised to turn off your vehicle engine . Using Connectors and Ports Never force a connector into a port . Check for obstructions on the port . If the connector and port do n't join with reasonable ease , they probably do n't match . Make sure that the connector matches the port and that you have positioned the connector correctly in relation to the port . Accessories and Wireless Performance Not all iPod accessories are fully compatible with iPhone . Turning on Airplane Mode on iPhone may eliminate audio interference between iPhone and an accessory . While Airplane mode is on , you can not make or receive calls or use features that require wireless communication . Under some conditions , certain accessories may affect iPhone wireless performance . Reorienting or relocating iPhone and the connected accessory may improve wireless performance . Keeping iPhone Within Acceptable Temperatures iPhone is designed to be operated in temperatures between 0o and 35o C ( 32o to 95o F ) and stored in temperatures between - 20o and 45o C ( - 4o to 113o F ) . Low - or high-temperature conditions might temporarily shorten battery life or cause iPhone to temporarily stop working properly . Leaving iPhone in a parked vehicle or in direct sunlight can cause iPhone to exceed these storage or operating temperature ranges . Avoid dramatic changes in temperature or humidity when using iPhone as condensation may form on or within iPhone . When you 're using iPhone or charging the battery , it is normal for iPhone to get warm . The exterior of iPhone functions as a cooling surface that transfers heat from inside the unit to the cooler air outside . Exposure to Radio Frequency Energy iPhone contains radio transmitters and receivers . When on , iPhone receives and sends out radio frequency ( RF ) energy through its antennas . The iPhone cellular antenna is located at the bottom edge of iPhone , to the left of the Home button . The Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Â® antenna is located at the top edge of iPhone , to the right of the headset jack . For optimal mobile device performance and to be sure that human exposure to RF energy does not exceed the FCC , IC , and European Union guidelines , always follow these instructions and precautions : When on a call using the built-in audio receiver in iPhone , hold iPhone with the dock connector pointed down toward your shoulder to increase separation from the antenna . When using iPhone near your body for voice calls or for wireless data transmission over a cellular network , keep iPhone at least 15 mm ( 5 / 8 inch ) away from the body , and only use carrying cases , belt clips , or holders that do not have metal parts and that maintain at least 15 mm ( 5 / 8 inch ) separation between iPhone and the body . iPhone is designed and manufactured to comply with the limits for exposure to RF energy set by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) of the United States , Industry Canada ( IC ) of Canada , and regulating entities of Japan , the European Union , and other countries . The exposure standard employs a unit of measurement known as the specific absorption rate , or SAR . The SAR limit applicable to iPhone set by the FCC is 1.6 watts per kilogram ( W / kg ) , 1.6 W / kg by Industry Canada , and 2.0 W / kg by the Council of the European Union . Tests for SAR are conducted using standard operating positions ( i . e . , at the ear and worn on the body ) specified by these agencies , with iPhone transmitting at its highest certified power level in all tested frequency bands . Although SAR is determined at the highest certified power level in each frequency band , the actual SAR level of iPhone while in operation can be well below the maximum value because iPhone adjusts its cellular transmitting power based in part on proximity to the wireless network . In general , the closer you are to a cellular base station , the lower the cellular transmitting power level . iPhone has been tested , and meets the FCC , IC , and European Union RF exposure guidelines for cellular , Wi-Fi , and Bluetooth operation ."

517	Payday loans no credit checks Payday Loans No Credit Checks â How It 's Possible With payday loans no credit checks are actually necessary , and for a lot of people , this is astounding . Almost every loan needs a credit check â why not these ? If you are one of the many who wonders why you never need a credit check for a pay day loan , this article will teach you the ins and outs of how pay day loans work . â¢ While banks perform credit checks as proof for future payments , it 's the concept that allows the payday loans with no credit checks policy to work . Instead of having proof of your payment , payday loans guarantee their payment through a debit card and a paycheck stub . by under with payday loans no credit checksThe paycheck stub will help lenders decide how much you can borrow , along with when you would need to pay it back . Once they have an idea of your income , they have an idea of how much your maximum payment could be , after all . This eliminates the possibility of over-borrowing . Ideally , payday loans allow the borrowers to automatically debit the payments that you owe , which means that it 's nearly impossible to default on this loan . Accidents do happen , though , and people have lost their job ( and paycheck ) while taking these loans . In cases like these , the interest rates often skyrocket . Pay day loans are considered to be a highly secured loan , which is why most of the interest that people have to pay for these loans happens in small amounts . The reason that payday loans require a debit card is because they need to be able to have some proof of your income , along with your basic ability to hold a bank account . A truly financially irresponsible person wo n't be able to even keep a bank account . Payday loans are very useful short-term loans for people who need quick cash , and have proof that they can pay it back in a short amount of time . After actually learning why everything is the way it is with payday loans , it 's easy to see why there are so many people who love pay day loans with no credit checks policy . Payday Loans No Credit Checks â Is It Worth It ? If you have been considering getting a loan similar to a pay day loans with no credit checks . That does n't mean that getting one of these FICO-free loans is always a good idea . In fact , it can be downright terrible for a person who does n't know what their doing .

However , a lack of a credit check often means that you may or may not get your FICO score to improve if you decide to take the loan , and successfully pay off the loan . Is it worth that gamble ? Getting a payday loan is easy , and tempting . While it 's common for payday loans with no credit checks policy to be advertised , you have to remember that it 's a very foolish idea to get a loan for something that you do n't totally need . If it 's for a splurge buy , step away from the payday loans' charm . You should save up for treats , just like everyone else . In cases of a sudden emergency , the policy that is held regarding payday loans no credit checks stance is a boon . You need the money NOW , and you know you can pay it off , right ? Well , in that case , get the money from a payday loan so that you can save yourself from ruin . It 's okay in this situation to do what you need to do . Although when borrowing using these payday loans with no credit checks are needed , it does n't mean that you can borrow whatever sum of money you may want . Lenders are extremely strict with maximum limits . If you need a lot more than what you make in 2 weeks , consider another loan instead . In an ideal world , there would n't need to be a credit score to rate everyone as borrowers . However , this is reality , and in reality credit checks are needed for almost every kind of loan . When your credit feels like a stigma , it 's understandable why so many want to avoid credit checks . It 's embarrassing , it 's inconvenient , and more often than not , it feels just terrible knowing what lenders will see on that report . Luckily , when given enough proof , such as with payday loans no credit checks are ever totally necessary .	Instruction

1457	"Artist impression of the Deep Impact flyby spacecraft releasing its impactor towards comet Tempel-1 in July 2005 . The flyby spacecraft has been re-christened EPOXI and will begin its new assignment to hunt for super-Earth exoplanets . Image : NASA . EPOXI is a combination of two separate science investigations , one consisting of the Extrasolar Planet Observations and Characterisation ( EPOCh ) and the other of the flyby of comet Hartley-2 , planned for 2010 , called the Deep Impact eXtended Investigation ( DIXI ) , which follows in the footsteps of the hugely successful Deep Impact mission in July 2005 which revealed in unprecedented detail the surface of a comet and the effects of impact into such a finely powdered surface . For the majority of May , EPOXI was trained on the red dwarf star GJ436 , 32 light years from Earth . This star has a Neptune sized planet circling it every 20 to 30 days in an unusually eccentric orbit . "" Tidal forces from the star should have made the orbit circular , unless there is another planet whose gravitational tug pulls the orbit into an oval shape , "" says Drake Deming , EPOXI's Deputy Principal Investigator . "" If that second planet lies in the same orbital plane as the Neptune-sized planet then we should see it transit . The transit would be too shallow to be spotted by ground-based telescopes , and EPOXI is the only space mission that can look at GJ436 nearly continuously for several weeks . "" Deming and his team are in the process of analysing the results of these data . In addition to targeting the red dwarf star , EPOXI imaged the Earth over three 24-hour periods , measuring its rotational light curve at visible wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared . These observations will help to calibrate future observations of Earthlike exoplanets . EPOXI obtained a particularly interesting view of the Earth on May 29 , when the Moon passed in front of the Earth as viewed from the spacecraft . Transit events such as this will help planetary scientists to deduce the nature and composition of exoplanetary systems . Deep Impact captured this beautiful image of the impact into Comet Tempel-1 three summers ago . Dust and gas streaming from the point of impact is lit up in the impact flash . Image : NASA ."	News

1227	University of Sheffield - Reduce Your Testing on Animals Freedom of Information requests discovered that the University of Sheffield killed 82,512 animals in tests during the 2015 / 16 academic year - an average of 226 animals killed each day . In 2014 / 15 , 67,236 animals were used and killed for testing purposes , with this figure going up 22.7 % during 2015 / 16 . The University should be cutting down not increasing the number of animals it uses in experiments ! With almost 90 % of drugs that pass animal tests failing human trials , these animals are undergoing immense suffering for very limited benefit , undermining public support , social progression and current medicinal advancements . We are requesting for the University to move away from testing on animals such as pigs , rabbits , mice , rats , gerbils and fish and to cruelty-free testing methods such as digital dissection software and human simulators .

1525	"One of the stars of ABS-CBN tv is the weather man Kuya Kim ( Kim Atienza ) . Kuya Kim Atienza After his talk about the weather he always tells something interesting about nature , animal life , some trivia or something like that . He always says goodbye with the words : Ang buhay ay weather weather lang . I have asked my wife Flor to explain this sentence to me because it was also used when Kuya Kim appeared as co-host in another show . It seems that this sentence has little to do with the weather . Actually it should go like this : Ang buhay ay pana-panahon lang . Panahon = ' it 's time ' ( or ' certain time ' ) , but also means ' weather ' . Panapanahon means more ' it 's time ' in a seasonal way . To make it sound more funny and also looking like it has to do something with the weather Kuya Kim says always : Ang buhay ay weather weather lang which actually means : ' life is changing with the times ' . It means to many Filipinos in the country that life has its ups and downs . And so does the weather . This saying of Kuya Kim seem not to be his own . Some people say it is copied from former president Joseph ' Erap ' Estrada ( saying "" Politics ay weather weather lang "" ) . Others say it was the comedian LEO MARTINEZ who used this phrase the first time in his shows . The phrase Kuya Kim is using demonstrates the difficulty of the Tagalog language . See also my post about my breaking tongue . Feel free to comment on this post : if you know a nice and / or difficult tagalog word or sentence , just put it in a comment . Thank You ."

99	"As someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible , standing in front of an audience is a cross between an out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights , so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments by relying on words on paper , and I only hope I 'm not struck by lightning bolts before I 'm done . I 'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer . I was a student in the '60s , a time of social upheaval and questioning , and on a personal level , an awakening sense of idealism . The war in Vietnam was raging , the Civil Rights Movement was under way , and pictures had a powerful influence on me . Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing , and photographers were telling us another . I believed the photographers , and so did millions of other Americans . Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism . They not only recorded history , they helped change the course of history . Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience , change became not only possible , but inevitable . I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism , specifically visual journalism , can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies . It can give credit to sound decision making , adding momentum to success . In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction , it becomes a kind of intervention , assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior . It puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact . What happens at ground level , far from the halls of power , happens to ordinary citizens one by one . And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view . It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice . And as a reaction , it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate , thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda , much as they would like to . Coming of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital for a free and dynamic society to function properly . The press is certainly a business , and in order to survive it must be a successful business , but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility . Society's problems ca n ' t be solved until they 're identified . On a higher plane , the press is a service industry , and the service it provides is awareness . Every story does not have to sell something . There 's also a time to give . That was a tradition I wanted to follow . Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution , I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer . But I was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti-war photograph . I 'd like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events and issues I 've been involved in over the past 25 years . In 1981 , I went to Northern Ireland . 10 IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death in protest against conditions in jail . The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation . I saw that the front lines of contemporary wars are not on isolated battlefields , but right where people live . During the early '80s , I spent a lot of time in Central America , which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War . In Guatemala , the central government -- controlled by a oligarchy of European decent -- was waging a scorched earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion , and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America : conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword . An anti-Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua . A destroyed tank belonging to Somoza's national guard was left as a monument in a park in Managua , and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child . At the same time , a civil war was taking place in El Salvador , and again , the civilian population was caught up in the conflict . I 've been covering the Palestinian-Israeli conflict since 1981 . This is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada , in 2000 , when it was still stones and Molotovs against an army . In 2001 , the uprising escalated into an armed conflict , and one of the major incidents was the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank town of Jenin . Without the political world to find common ground , the continual friction of tactic and counter-tactic only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance , and perpetuates the cycle of violence . In the '90s , after the breakup of the Soviet Union , Yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines , and civil war broke out between Bosnia , Croatia and Serbia . This is a scene of house-to-house fighting in Mostar , neighbor against neighbor . A bedroom , the place where people share intimacy , where life itself is conceived , became a battlefield . A mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery and was used as a makeshift morgue . Dead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle and used as barter for the return of prisoners or Bosnian soldiers killed in action . This was once a park . The Bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now . At the same time in South Africa , after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison , the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid . One of the things I had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger . I had to use it , channel its energy , turn it into something that would clarify my vision , instead of clouding it . In Transkei , I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood , of the Xhosa tribe . Teenage boys lived in isolation , their bodies covered with white clay . After several weeks , they washed off the white and took on the full responsibilities of men . It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa . Children in Soweto playing on a trampoline . Elsewhere in Africa there was famine . In Somalia , the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out . Farmers were driven off their land , and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen . Starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction -- primitive but extremely effective . Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated , slowly and painfully . The international community responded with massive humanitarian relief , and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved . American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments , but they were eventually drawn into the conflict , and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu , they were withdrawn . In southern Sudan , another civil war saw similar use of starvation as a means of genocide . Again , international NGOs , united under the umbrella of the UN , staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved . I 'm a witness , and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored . I also want it to be powerful and eloquent , and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the people I 'm photographing . This man was in an NGO feeding center , being helped as much as he could be helped . He literally had nothing . He was a virtual skeleton , yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move . He had not given up , and if he did n't give up , how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope ? In 1994 , after three months of covering the South African election , I saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela , and it was the most uplifting thing I 've ever seen . It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer . The next day I left for Rwanda , and it was like taking the express elevator to hell . This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp . He allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time , and he even turned his face toward the light , as if he wanted me to see him better . I think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world . This time , maybe confused or discouraged by the military disaster in Somalia , the international community remained silent , and somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered by their own countrymen -- sometimes their own neighbors -- using farm implements as weapons . Perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in Bosnia and the failure in Rwanda , when Serbia attacked Kosovo international action was taken much more decisively . NATO forces went in , and the Serbian army withdrew . Ethnic Albanians had been murdered , their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported . They were received in refugee camps set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia . The imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home . The image reminded me of a cave painting , and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways . Between 1995 and ' 96 , I covered the first two wars in Chechnya from inside Grozny . This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army . The Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks , killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside . I found a boy from the local orphanage wandering around the front line . My work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war to a focus on critical social issues as well . After the fall of Ceausescu , I went to Romania and discovered a kind of gulag of children , where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions . Ceausescu had imposed a quota on the number of children to be produced by each family , thereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy . Children who could n ' t be supported by their families were raised in government orphanages . Children with birth defects were labeled incurables , and confined for life to inhuman conditions . As reports began to surface , again international aid went in . Going deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes , I worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution , where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population . An aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust , and four out of five workers came down with cancer . After the fall of Suharto in Indonesia , I began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization . I spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident . When the story was published , unsolicited donations poured in . A trust fund was established , and the family now lives in a house in the countryside and all their basic necessities are taken care of . It was a story that was n ' t trying to sell anything . Journalism had provided a channel for people's natural sense of generosity , and the readers responded . I met a band of homeless children who 'd come to Jakarta from the countryside , and ended up living in a train station . By the age of 12 or 14 , they 'd become beggars and drug addicts . The rural poor had become the urban poor , and in the process they 'd become invisible . These heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan reminded me of figures in a play by Beckett : isolated , waiting in the dark , but drawn to the light . Agent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War to deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army . The active ingredient was dioxin , an extremely toxic chemical that was sprayed in vast quantities , and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation . In 2000 , I began documenting global health issues , concentrating first on AIDS in Africa . I tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers . I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped , whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations . So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic that grandmothers have taken the place of parents , and a lot of children had been born with HIV . A hospital in Zambia . I begun documenting the close connection between HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis . This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia . My pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs by shedding light on the critical social problems they 're trying to deal with . I went to Congo with MSF , and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died , and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon . A malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program . In the fall of 2004 I went to Darfur . This time I was on an assignment for a magazine , but again worked closely with MSF . The international community still has n ' t found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide . An MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people . I 've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America . This is a scene from New Orleans . A prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun . This experience raised a lot of questions , among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available . In the yard of a chain gang in Alabama . I did n't see either of the planes hit . When I glanced out my window , I saw the first tower burning , and I thought it might have been an accident . A few minutes later when I looked again and saw the second tower burning , I knew we were at war . In the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero , I had a realization . I 'd been photographing in the Islamic world since 1981 -- not only in the Middle East , but also in Africa , Asia and Europe . At the time I was photographing in these different places , I thought I was covering separate stories . But on 9 / 11 history crystallized , and I understood I 'd actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years , and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation . The central commercial district of Kabul , Afghanistan at the end of the civil war , shortly before the city fell to the Taliban . Land mine victims being helped at the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo . A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine . I 'd witnessed immense suffering in the Islamic world from political oppression , civil war , foreign invasions , poverty , famine . I understood that in its suffering , the Islamic world had been crying out . Why were n ' t we listening ? A Taliban fighter shot during a battle as the Northern Alliance entered the city of Kunduz . When war with Iraq was imminent , I realized the American troops would be very well covered , so I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad . A marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family . A day after American forces entered Baghdad , a company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers and were cheered on by the crowds -- a hopeful moment that was short lived . For the first time in years , Shi ' ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to Karbala to observe Ashura , and I was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion . A group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives . It was obvious that the Shi ' ites were a force to be reckoned with , and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them . Last year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops , from the battlefield in Iraq all the way home . This is a helicopter medic giving CPR to a soldier who had been shot in the head . Military medicine has become so efficient that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history . The signature weapon of the war is the IED , and the signature wound is severe leg damage . After enduring extreme pain and trauma , the wounded face a grueling physical and psychological struggle in rehab . The spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable . I tried to imagine myself in their place , and I was totally humbled by their courage and determination in the face of such catastrophic loss . Good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results . One day in rehab someone , started talking about surfing and all these guys who 'd never surfed before said , "" Hey , lets go . "" And they went surfing . Photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people what 's going on . Sometimes they put their lives on the line , because they believe your opinions and your influence matter . They aim their pictures at your best instincts , generosity , a sense of right and wrong , the ability and the willingness to identify with others , the refusal to accept the unacceptable . My TED wish : there 's a vital story that needs to be told , and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era . Thank you very much . ( Applause )"	Opinion/Argumentation
1646	"Grandmaster ( chess ) The title Grandmaster is awarded to chess players by the world chess organization FIDE . Apart from World Champion , Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain . Once achieved , the title is held for life . In chess literature it is usually abbreviated to GM . ( Other titles are also often abbreviated : FM for FIDE Master , IM for International Master , and CM for Candidate Master . ) The abbreviation IGM for International Grandmaster is also sometimes used , particularly in older literature . Grandmaster , International Master , and FIDE Master are open to both men and women . A number of women have earned the GM title , with the first two having been Nona Gaprindashvili in 1978 and Susan Polgar in 1991 . Since about 2000 , most of the top 10 women have held the GM title . A separate gender-segregated title , Woman Grandmaster ( WGM ) , is also available . It is awarded to women who attain a level of skill between that of a FIDE Master and an International Master . The first known use of the term grandmaster in connection with chess was in an 1838 issue of Bell's Life , in which a correspondent referred to William Lewis as "" our past grandmaster "" . Lewis himself later referred to Philidor as a grandmaster , and the term was also applied to a few other players . In the Ostend tournament of 1907 the term grandmaster ( GroÃmeister in German ) was used . The tournament was divided into two sections : the Championship Tournament and the Masters' Tournament . The Championship section was for players who had previously won an international tournament . Siegbert Tarrasch won the Championship section , over Carl Schlechter , Dawid Janowski , Frank Marshall , Amos Burn , and Mikhail Chigorin . These players were described as grandmasters for the purposes of the tournament . Non-standard and Soviet usage before 1950 Before 1950 , the term grandmaster was sometimes informally applied to other world class players . The FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale des Ãchecs ( FIDE , or World Chess Federation ) was formed in Paris in 1924 , but at that time did not formulate criteria on who should earn the title . In 1927 , the Soviet Union's Chess Federation established the title of Grandmaster of the Soviet Union , for their own players , since at that time Soviets were not competing outside their own country . This title was abolished in 1931 , after having been awarded to Boris Verlinsky , who won the 1929 Soviet Championship . The title was brought back in 1935 , and awarded to Mikhail Botvinnik , who thus became the first "" official "" Grandmaster of the USSR . Verlinsky did not get his title back . When FIDE reorganized after World War II it adopted regulations concerning the award of international titles . Titles were awarded by a resolution of the FIDE General Assembly and the Qualification Committee . FIDE first awarded the Grandmaster title in 1950 to 27 players . These players were : Since FIDE did not award the Grandmaster title posthumously , world-class players who died prior to 1950 , including World Champions Steinitz , Lasker , Capablanca , and Alekhine , never received the title . Title awards under the original regulations were subject to political concerns . Efim Bogoljubov , who had emigrated from the Soviet Union to Germany , was not entered in the first class of Grandmasters , even though he had played two matches for the World Championship with Alekhine . He received the title in 1951 , by a vote of thirteen to eight with five abstentions . Yugoslavia supported his application , but all other Communist countries opposed it . In 1953 , FIDE abolished the old regulations , although a provision was maintained that allowed older masters who had been overlooked to be awarded titles . The new regulations awarded the title of International Grandmaster of the FIDE to players meeting any of the following criteria : The world champion . Masters who have the absolute right to play in the World Championship Candidates Tournament , or any player who replaces an absent contestant and earns at least a 50 percent score . The winner of an international tournament meeting specified standards , and any player placing second in two such tournaments within a span of four years . The tournament must be at least eleven rounds with seven or more players , 80 percent or more being International Grandmasters or International Masters . Additionally , 30 percent of the players must be Grandmasters who have the absolute right to play in the next World Championship Candidates Tournament , or who have played in such a tournament in the previous ten years . A player who demonstrates ability manifestly equal to that of ( 3 ) above in an international tournament or match . Such titles must be approved by the Qualification Committee with the support of at least five members . After FIDE issued the 1953 title regulations , it was recognized that they were somewhat haphazard , and work began to revise the regulations . The FIDE Congress in Vienna in 1957 adopted new regulations , called the FAV system , in recognition of the work done by International Judge Giovanni Ferrantes ( Italy ) , Alexander ( probably Conel Hugh O ' Donel Alexander ) , and Giancarlo Dal Verme ( Italy ) . Under the 1957 regulations , the title of International Grandmaster of the FIDE was automatically awarded to : The world champion . Any player qualifying from the Interzonal tournament to play in the Candidates Tournament , even if he did not play in the Candidates for any reason . Any player who would qualify from the Interzonal to play in the Candidates but who was excluded because of a limitation on the number of participants from his Federation . Any player who actually plays in a Candidates Tournament and scores at least 331 â 3 percent . The regulations also allowed titles to be awarded by a FIDE Congress on recommendation by the Qualification Committee . Recommendations were based on performance in qualifying tournaments , with the required score depending on the percentage of Grandmasters and International Masters in the tournament . Concerns were raised that the 1957 regulations were too lax . At the FIDE Congress in 1961 , GM Milan Vidmar said that the regulations "" made it possible to award international titles to players without sufficient merit "" . At the 1964 Congress in Tel Aviv , a subcommittee was formed to propose changes to the regulations . The subcommittee recommended that the automatic award of titles be abolished , criticized the methods used for awarding titles based on qualifying performances , and called for a change in the makeup of the Qualification Committee . Several delegates supported the subcommittee recommendations , including GM Miguel Najdorf who felt that existing regulations were leading to an inflation of international titles . At the 1965 Congress in Wiesbaden FIDE raised the standards required for international titles . The International Grandmaster title regulations were : 1 . Any World Champion is automatically awarded the GM title 2a . Anyone who scores at least 40 percent in a quarter-final match in the Candidates Tournament 2b . Scores at least the number of points in a tournament corresponding to the total of a 55 percent score against Grandmasters plus 75 percent against International Masters ( IM ) plus 85 percent against other players ( a GM "" norm "" ) . To fulfill requirement 2b , the candidate must score one GM norm in a category 1a tournament or two norms within a three-year period in two Category 1b tournaments , or one Category 2a tournament and one Category 1b tournament . The categories of tournaments are : 1a â at least sixteen players , at least 50 percent are GMs , and 70 percent at least IMs 1b â at least twelve players , at least 331 â 3 percent GMs and 70 percent IMs 2a â at least fifteen players , at least 50 percent IMs 2b â ten to fourteen players , at least 50 percent IMs . Since FIDE titles are for life , a GM or IM does not count for the purposes of this requirement if he had not had a GM or IM result in the five years prior to the tournament . In addition , no more than 50 percent plus one of the players can be from the same country for tournaments of 10 to 12 players , or no more than 50 percent plus two for larger tournaments . Seventy-four GM titles were awarded in 1951 through 1968 . During that period , ten GM titles were awarded in 1965 , but only one in 1966 and in 1968 . The modern system for awarding FIDE titles evolved from the "" Dorazil "" proposals , presented to the 1970 Siegen Chess Olympiad FIDE Congress . The proposals were put together by Dr Wilfried Dorazil ( then FIDE Vice-President ) and fellow Committee members Grandmaster Svetozar GligoriÄ and Professor Arpad Elo . The recommendations of the Committee report were adopted in full . In essence , the proposals built on the work done by Professor Elo in devising his Elo rating system . The establishment of an updated list of players and their Elo rating enabled significantly strong international chess tournaments to be allocated a "" Category "" , based on the average rating of the contestants . For instance , it was decided that ' Category 1 ' status would apply to tournaments with an average Elo rating of participants falling within the range 2251 â 2275 ; similarly Category 2 would apply to the range 2276 â 2300 etc. The higher the tournament Category , the stronger the tournament . Another vital component involved the setting of meritorious "" scores "" for each Category of tournament . A player must meet or surpass the relevant score to demonstrate that they had performed at Grandmaster ( GM ) or International Master ( IM ) level . Scores were expressed as percentages of a perfect maximum score and decreased as the tournament Category increased , thereby reflecting the strength of a player's opposition and the relative difficulty of the task . Tournament organisers could then apply the percentages to their own tournament format and declare in advance the actual score that participants must achieve to attain a GM or IM result ( nowadays referred to as a norm ) . To qualify for the Grandmaster title , a player needed to achieve three such GM results within a rolling period of three years . Exceptionally , if a player's contributory games totalled thirty or more , then the title could be awarded on the basis of two such results . There were also circumstances where the system could be adapted to fit team events and other competitions . The full proposals included many other rules and regulations , covering such topics as : From 1977 until 2003 , FIDE awarded honorary Grandmaster titles to 31 players based on their past performances or other contributions to chess . Since 2007 , no distinction has been made between an "" honorary "" grandmaster and a full grandmaster . The following players have been awarded honorary Grandmaster titles : The requirements for becoming a Grandmaster are somewhat complex . A player must have attained an Elo rating of at least 2500 ( although they need not maintain this level to obtain or keep the title ) . In addition , at least two favorable results ( called norms ) from a total of at least 27 games in tournaments involving other Grandmasters , including some from countries other than the applicant 's , are usually required before FIDE will confer the title on a player . There are other milestones a player can achieve to get the title , such as winning the Women's World Championship , the World Junior Championship , or the World Senior Championship . Current regulations can be found in the FIDE Handbook . In 1957 , there were 50 GMs ( USSR : 19 , Yugoslavia : 7 , USA : 5 , Argentina : 4 , West Germany : 2 , France : 2 , Sweden : 1 , Czechoslovakia : 1 , Hungary : 1 , Austria : 1 , Belgium : 1 , Denmark : 1 , Netherlands : 1 , Poland : 1 ) . In 1972 , there were 88 GMs with 33 representing the USSR . The current FIDE ratings list includes over 1000 Grandmasters . Nigel Short was rated the third best player in the world in 1989 with a rating of 2650 ; in the 21st century such a rating would only be good enough for a player to reach the top 100 or so , with the third best player in the world usually rated around 2800 . Other minor factors come into play : there are more tournaments worldwide and cheaper air travel makes them more accessible to globe-trotting chess professionals , who include many players from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe whose movements are no longer restricted as they were before the 1990s . Additionally , players can make norms in tournaments that would have been previously considered too short for norms , making norms easier to get and allowing for more norm tournaments to be held . December 2008 saw a record number of GMs ( 1 , 192 ) and IMs ( 2 , 916 ) , causing some FIDE officials to suggest that FIDE should consider an "" elite grandmaster "" title . The unofficial title "" Super Grandmaster "" is sometimes used by players to refer to those with a 2700 + rating to distinguish the most serious world champion contenders . The proportion of titled players among rated players is actually becoming smaller due to the rise in the number of all chess players worldwide who have FIDE ratings . In response , one member of the FIDE Titles & Ratings Committee observed that it is now more common for weaker players to get FIDE ratings , so the comparison of Grandmasters as a proportion of all rated players is not really helpful ."

Ebbers was not a detached , unknowing chief executive Financial Services Committee spokeswoman Peggy Peterson An email sent on 18 March informed former chief executive Bernard Ebbers and former chief financial officer Scott Sullivan of concerns about accounting issues related to the preparation of WorldCom's annual report , the US House Financial Services Committee said . During the same month , Salomon Smith Barney's former telecoms analyst , Jack Grubman , warned Mr Sullivan that his firm was dropping WorldCom from a list of recommended shares before the information was released to investors . In an email sent on 12 March , Mr Grubman insisted that he had not been the one responsible for removing the firm from the list . "" This is our strategist , not us . Which is why I hate ever having a name on that list , "" Mr Grubman said in the email . In the know Mr Grubman's warning was forwarded by Mr Sullivan to his boss , Mr Ebbers , the investigators said . Mr Sullivan could be sent to prison for 65 years A third email which was sent in May revealed that Mr Sullivan had tried to brush off an inquiry from the credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service . "" Overall , what all this has in common is it shows how Mr Ebbers , Mr Sullivan and Mr Grubman dealt with questions about WorldCom : They obfuscated every time , "" Financial Services Committee spokeswoman Peggy Peterson said .

640	"Childhood Memories That Made Me Who I am Today : I was 15 when my father died and after his death I received my result card through the post . I was really happy to see that I passed the exam with excellent marks but I wanted to go to college but it was hard for my brother to send me to college . But I started to teach other children in the village . They really needed help in their studies because their parents could n't read or write they send them to me in evenings after school . So in the morning I 'd go to college and in the evening I teach them and I 'd use the money they gave me to pay my college fees , bus fare and I made my uniform with my own money and I was really happy because I had got everything that I want . I worked hard that 's why I want my son to work hard to carry on with his studies . I was born in the Yemen in 1976 . I lived in a village called Yafa with my Mum and two brothers . My dad lived in England because he was working there and he was sending us some money to live on . I hardly knew my dad because the first time I saw him was when I was 2 years old , which is a time I ca n't remember . When I was about 4 or 5 years old my dad came to visit us and I will never forget that day because he bought me a big doll which I really loved and he bought us lots of things . I was very happy . We used to live a very poor life . We all stayed in one room . We slept , cooked , ate and sat in the same room but me and my brothers were very happy and we used to spend most of our time outside playing . My Mum was n't very well . Also she had to work very hard because in the village we had to go very far to fetch the water from the well and to fetch the wood to cook on . We had electricity but it only came on at night for a few hours . We also had to help my granddad in the field . After a few years my Mum's health deteriorated and my Dad wanted us to go and live with him . We were very happy and we went to the city to go to the British Embassy . The city life was very different to the village life . It was more modernised and I loved it and I still remember the blue sea , it was beautiful . However the bad news was that the British Embassy refused to let me go with my parents to England because the law in Yemen did not allow any children who were over 7 years old to go out of the country and unfortunately I was seven years old . My brother's were younger than me so they went with my Mum . We all were sad and disappointed especially my Mum she was devestated but she was very ill . Her Mum and Dad told her to go and leave me with them . I remember the day when she left she was crying all day but I was excited and happy to live with my grandparents . When my Mum kissed me goodbye I saw her crying and I started to cry . I was very happy with my grandparents and they loved me very much and they did their best to make me happy . They gave me everything I wanted and they were very nice and kind to me . My grandparents house had one room and a very small kitchen . They had a cow , some sheep and some chickens and I used to help look after them which I really enjoyed . I used to go to school . I started just before my mum left but I did n't like it . I stayed in school for four years then I left because I wanted to help my grandparents more . What I really enjoyed the most was fetching the water from the well with my friends . We used to have lots of fun and we used to go to fetch some wood and it was very far away so we used to go up the hills and down and we played on the way and we had a laugh . We had to get up very early just before the sun rise and we came back after the sunset . I think that these were the best times in my childhood . As I grew older I missed my mum and brothers very much . I used to cry every night as I remembered them and I never stopped thinking about my parents They used to send me some letters , clothes and money and we talked on the phone only once in two or three years because the telephone was very far from our house and very expensive . When I was about 12 years old I used to do everything in the house such as cooking , cleaning , taking care of the animals and helping my granddad in the fields as well as fetching the water and the wood . My day would start at 5.30 in the morning and would end when I went to bed which was about 8 . 00pm In the morning when I saw the other kids going to school , I realised how much I missed school and I wanted to go back so my friends and me decided to go back and we did . I really liked it this time and I did n't want to leave because we had such a good time . When I was 13 years old , I realised how much I missed my family because when I was younger it did n't really bother me but then I really wanted to see them . One day just a few months before my 14th birthday I received a letter from my mum and dad and she said they wanted me to join them in the UK . The law in Yemen had changed because the south and the north of Yemen were united . I was very happy and very excited and at the same time I was shocked because I did n't expect that to happen as I thought they might come to visit . I was so happy that I could n't sleep that night I could n't believe that I was going to see them after 7 years without them . After a few months and just a week before my birthday I finely went to England and my granddad came with me . It was very hard to leave my grandma and all my friends . When I arrived at the airport my mum and dad were there and I did n't recognise them but I was very happy to see them . When we went home and I saw my brothers I could n't believe how big they were , because I was imagining them small like when they were in Yemen but they looked different . I liked the house even though it was a small 3 bedroom house , but it was different compare to the house in Yemen . A few weeks later it was my birthday . I had a big party and I had lots of presents . I was playing with my dolls and I felt like a child again because in Yemen I felt like an adult I was only 13 years old , but I had lots of responsibility and I did n't have time to play . For the first few months I was very happy and I loved England until I started school . I did n't like school because I could n't speak English . I did n't understand a word and it was very difficult for me to make friends . Some children used to make fun of me and they used to call me names and they used to say horrible things to me which I did n't understand at the time but they knew it was n't nice and my teacher was n't nice either . I was the only child who spoke Arabic in the school . I hated school and sometimes I used to come home crying . In the school I felt like I was deaf and dumb because I did n't know what they were saying to me and I could n't talk to them . It was terrible . At home I felt a bit strange . I felt like I did n't know my family even though my mum and dad used to spoil me and they bought me everything that I Iiked . My brothers used to be jalice of me and I did n't like that . I hated England and I wanted to go back to Yemen . I really missed my grandparents and my friends and all the things that I used to do . I remember when we first came to England - my granddad - on one day regularly he used to always take my 3 brothers , my sister and myself on the 75 bus from our house on Barnsley Road - it was a very long journey to Millhouses park . It used to be our treat . He used to put us on the peddle boats and then pay for an ice-cream each then we used to get on the bus back home . My granddad was a very caring person this makes me always wanting to be there wherever my children are , know what they are always doing . It was the day before Eid . I was about 8 years old , and I living in the Yemen with my grandparents . "" Is it Eid tomorrow ? "" I asked my grandmother happily . "" We do n't know yet , We have to wait til the sun goes down , then we will foind out "" . "" Why ca n't we find out now ? "" I 'm going outside to look if I can see the moon "" , I said angrily . I went outside and I was looking to the sky , the sky was very clear , but I could n't see the moon . I walked back to house slowly and sadly . My grandmother was getting the food ready . "" I want to help your grandmother , what can I do ? "" "" Go and get the things ready for the fire "" . My grandmother said , so I ran quickly to the top of the house and I got all the things we needed for the fire . If the next day was Eid everyone would go to the roofs of their houses and light a little fire and that was the sign . We see the fire and the hole village know it 's Eid the next day . I was very excited and I could n't wait till the sun goes down . I went to the kitchen and I said "" The fire is ready grandma . What shall I do now . "" ' The food is ready , so there 's nothing to do now . We have to wait till the sun goes down . There was only about 10 minutes left but it seemed very long and it went past so slowly . When I was child and go to school when I came back from school my Mom wanted me to help in the kitchen but I said I needed to do my school work . I admired my Mum she was very great because she brought me from there to here . She taught me everything . Now I think what Mom said to me about doing house work is true . At that time it was very difficult to do all things but it is good how much I learned then . Now I can do everything like handle my house , cooking , serving , looking after my guests and my inlaws are happy with me . Now I am really happy with my Mom . I remember the closed doors when I came to England . Everyone shut their doors . In Pakistan all the doors were kept open and everyone shared everything . We often visited each other 's houses I was born in Somalia second capital city of Somalia it was a big city . My mum has 3 boys and 3 girls I am second child of my mum I used to be when under 10 I like to play outside play with the boys and girl . I used to go to school in a morning walk to school it 's far from my house come back and then I would go to religious school as well . I was beastly as a child ; I used to love playing outside I do n't like the indoors my mum she used to be shouting at me all the time "" come on in and help me "" I used to help my mum cooking and cleaning the house I used to do quickly the house work to go outside and play , I would make it a race they used to be girls working in the house no boys always girls I say spare to me to play outside they never do house work but my girl friends always racing saying whose going to finish house work first we finish quickly as soon as we can to play outside .

I remember us all being born '' cos we were kept like a second thing in my mum's life ' cos of my grandparents . We had to wash the clothes and that because there was n't a washing machine , I remember my 3 brothers when we first had our cycle because in Pakistan we could l get a cycle with five seats it was a beautiful moment when we could all sit on the cycle together and ride away on the uneven roads they were all dusty and uneven but it made it special because we were all a family . My dad came to England to work before he bought us all when he could afford to bring us all and he bought my grandparents . I remember my granddad always used to take us on a bus to Millhouses park once a week all 5 of us on the bus and he 'd buy us and ice cream and put us in the boats , oh he was such a good natured person he was so loveable and cuddly all the time with us my dad is totally different he 's a bit hard with us he 's not a soft person he does n't do that with my kids , his grandchildren . My granddad used to do that with us all the time . When he passed away it was a real emotional time . Those are the memories that I like to keep ."	Opinion/Argumentation
783	Gastrointestinal mucositis is a dose-limiting side-effect of many cancer therapies . Interruption of cell production by a cytotoxic agent can cause a breach of the mucosal barrier ( ulceration ) if the stem cells are killed . However , few in vivo assays measure these responses . EpiStem has developed CLONOQUANTTM , a sophisticated in vivo intestinal stem cell assay , analogous to the spleen colony assay for bone marrow stem cells . This enables the assessment of both the propensity of a novel anti-cancer drug to cause mucositis and the potential of a novel anti-mucositis drug to reduce these debilitating side-effects . OROQUANTTM measures similar responses and treatment effects in the mouth , where painful ulcers commonly occur . Typical mucositis measurements : Number of surviving clonogenic cells Speed and efficiency of tissue repair Quantification of functional impairment ( diarrhea measurements ) Some applications of our assays : Assess the efficacy of mucositis modulatory or prevention agents Assess the efficiency of tissue regeneration enhancers Determine the side-effects of potential cytotoxic agents before reaching the clinic - a surrogate assay for patient well-being during chemotherapy Assess if a drug candidate has stem cell stimulatory or inhibitory effects	Information/Explanation
1677	Water vapor is the most potent of the greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere , and it 's sort of a unique player among the greenhouse gases . The amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can not , in general , be directly modified by human behavior â it 's set by air temperatures . The warmer the surface , the greater the evaporation rate of water from the surface . As a result , increased evaporation leads to a greater concentration of water vapor in the lower atmosphere capable of absorbing infrared radiation and emitting it downward . Surface-level ozone Johnny Stockshooter â age fotostock / Imagestate The next most significant greenhouse gas is surface , or low-level , ozone ( O 3 ) . Surface O 3 is a result of air pollution ; it must be distinguished from naturally occurring stratospheric O 3 , which has a very different role in the planetary radiation balance . The primary natural source of surface O 3 is the subsidence of stratospheric O 3 from the upper atmosphere toward Earth's surface . In contrast , the primary human-driven source of surface O 3 is in photochemical reactions involving carbon monoxide ( CO ) , such as in smog .	Information/Explanation

The Colorado estate tax is based on the death tax credit allowable on the federal tax return . If you would like to have your heirs protected from being taxed unnecessarily by these two jurisdictions , you need to meet with a Colorado estate planning attorney . The Colorado estate planning attorney is knowledgeable in all state and federal tax law . When you are drawing up your will you can investigate options such as trusts and any other tax protection measures that can be taken to reduce any tax liability your estate causes your heirs . For example ; some life insurance proceeds and annuities will not be considered part of the "" gross estate "" and the Colorado estate planning attorney may be able to recommend you purchase one of these products Court in Denver Aims to Reduce Repeat Offenders A new sobriety court in Denver has high hopes for reducing the number of repeat DUI offenders in the state of Colorado . The mammoth efforts of law enforcement officials have helped to reduce the number of arrested for suspicion of DUI by nearly twenty five percent in 2010 compared to 2008 but nearly thirty percent of those arrested for DUI in Colorado have involved repeat offenders . The new court will implement a combination of current punishments and an intensive treatment program that could help to rehabilitate drivers who could have been likely to have gotten behind the wheel while impaired again . The program will be funded by nearly six hundred thousand dollars in grant money and will focus on lengthy bouts of treatment and frequent blood alcohol monitoring and regular interactions with judges to monitor progress . While this program may not be right for everyone who has made the decision to get behind the wheel while impaired more than once it could make a big difference in making the streets safer . Unfortunately , the program wo n't be large enough to accommodate all repeat offenders and many will still face the possibility of very severe punishments of prison , fines and license suspensions . If you are facing a first time or subsequent DUI charge in Colorado you need to hire an experienced Colorado criminal defense attorney . Hiring a Colorado criminal defense attorney gives you the best opportunity of having your DUI charges reduced or dismissed so that you face a series of much more tolerable punishments following your trial . Holiday Efforts Result in DUI Arrests Law enforcement officials in Colorado seem even more serious about removing impaired drivers from the streets this summer and keeping Colorado streets safe . In a one night DUI checkpoint on Fort Collins on Memorial Day Weekend police made contact with over 1000 drivers and ultimately arrested more than twenty for driving under the influence or driving while ability impaired . This monumental effort was just the beginning of the 100 Day of Heat program in Colorado that will increase officer presence and efforts on the streets and help to minimize the number of DUI related accidents and fatalities that plague the state of Colorado this summer . All of these additional DUI arrests across the state should have Colorado criminal defense attorneys very busy . The possible penalties associated with a DUI in the state of Colorado are among the most severe in the entire country . First time offenders of DUI in Colorado face the possibility of mandatory jail time , high fines and lengthy driver's license suspensions and the only way to ensure the best possible outcome from your trial is to enlist the services of an experienced professional to build an effective defense . A Colorado criminal defense attorney will examine the evidence that the prosecution has against you and the methods by which that evidence was gathered by arresting officers . If anything at all that occurred during the course of your investigation seems amiss your Colorado criminal defense attorney will use that information to bolster your defense and increase your chances of having your charges reduced or dismissed . Driving While Impaired Can Lead to Other Poor Decisions Deciding to get behind the wheel of your automobile after having had a few too many drinks is most certainly not a good idea . Impaired driving can easily result in serious accidents that cause injuries or deaths and the charges associated with a DUI conviction are something that no one wants to experience . Unfortunately many drivers still decide to get behind the wheel while intoxicated and that initial poor decision can often lead to subsequent poor decisions that ultimately cause more damage and increase the consequences that will be faced following the incident . Some drivers who operate their vehicles while impaired and get stopped by police are frightened by the potential consequences that they could face and wind up attempting to evade police . Attempting to get away from a police stop can easily result in a host of moving violations and , if an accident should occur , possibly even assault , manslaughter or murder charges depending upon the specific details . These potential charges carry much more severe consequences than a DUI charge would alone and attempted evasion makes structuring your defense a much more difficult task . If you are facing DUI charges in the state of Colorado you immediately reach out to an experienced Colorado criminal defense attorney . A Colorado criminal defense attorney will build the most suitable plan of defense for your specific situation and work to ensure that your rights are upheld throughout the hearing . Though it might seem tempting to avoid the charges at all costs by evading the police you will likely have much more luck entrusting your defense to a good attorney . Organized Shoplifting Rings Attack Colorado Stores Highly organized teams of thieves enter retail stores and grabbing insanely large amounts of everyday goods in order to fund criminal activity . The shoplifters pilfer desirable and useful items like baby formula an OTC pain relievers and then sell them for fast cash over the internet . The groups are hitting major retailers throughout Colorado and experts estimate that the activity is costing stores across the country more thirty five billion dollars each year . These criminals have literally taken the crime of shoplifting to an entirely new level and if they get caught they should expect to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . Many people feel as though shoplifting is n't a very serious crime , but theft in any form can result in serious consequences . Depending upon the type of item or the value of the item stolen a shoplifting charge can carry some highly undesirable possible penalties . If you are facing shoplifting or theft charges in the state of Colorado you should reach out to an experienced Colorado criminal defense attorney as soon as possible . Your Colorado criminal defense attorney will be able to clearly explain the charges against you and the possible penalties that could go along with them and then go over all of your potential options for defense . You 'll get the expert advice that you need to make it through this very stressful situation and the confidence that your professionally structured plan of defense will result in the best possible verdict from your criminal hearing ."

1631	"As illustrated by the graph on the left , the basic symptoms of autism are often accompanied other medical conditions and challenges . These , too , can vary widely in severity . While autism is usually a life-long condition , all children and adults benefit from interventions , or therapies , that can reduce symptoms and increase skills and abilities . Although it is best to begin intervention as soon as possible , the benefits of therapy can continue throughout life . Social Challenges Typically developing infants are social by nature . They gaze at faces , turn toward voices , grasp a finger and even smile by 2 to 3 months of age . By contrast , most children who develop autism have difficulty engaging in the give-and-take of everyday human interactions . By 8 to 10 months of age , many infants who go on to develop autism are showing some symptoms such as failure to respond to their names , reduced interest in people and delayed babbling . By toddlerhood , many children with autism have difficulty playing social games , do n't imitate the actions of others and prefer to play alone . They may fail to seek comfort or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in typical ways . It is common â but not universal â for those with autism to have difficulty regulating emotions . This can take the form of seemingly "" immature "" behavior such as crying or having outbursts in inappropriate situations . It can also lead to disruptive and physically aggressive behavior . The tendency to "" lose control "" may be particularly pronounced in unfamiliar , overwhelming or frustrating situations . Frustration can also result in self-injurious behaviors such as head banging , hair pulling or self-biting . Communication Difficulties By age three , most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language . One of the earliest is babbling . By the first birthday , most typically developing toddlers say a word or two , turn and look when they hear their names , point to objects they want or want to show to someone ( not all cultures use pointing in this way ) . When offered something distasteful , they can make clear â by sound or expression â that the answer is "" no . "" By contrast , young children with autism tend to be delayed in babbling and speaking and learning to use gestures . Some infants who later develop autism coo and babble during the first few months of life before losing these communicative behaviors . Others experience significant language delays and do n't begin to speak until much later . With therapy , however , most people with autism do learn to use spoken language and all can learn to communicate . Many nonverbal or nearly nonverbal children and adults learn to use communication systems such as pictures ( image at left ) , sign language , electronic word processors or even speech-generating devices . When language begins to develop , the person with autism may use speech in unusual ways . Some have difficulty combining words into meaningful sentences . They may speak only single words or repeat the same phrase over and over . Some go through a stage where they repeat what they hear verbatim ( echolalia ) . Some mildly affected children exhibit only slight delays in language or even develop precocious language and unusually large vocabularies â yet have difficulty sustaining a conversation . Some children and adults with autism tend to carry on monologues on a favorite subject , giving others little chance to comment . In other words , the ordinary "" give and take "" of conversation proves difficult . Some children with ASD with superior language skills tend to speak like little professors , failing to pick up on the "" kid-speak "" that 's common among their peers . Conversely , someone affected by autism may not exhibit typical body language . Facial expressions , movements and gestures may not match what they are saying . Their tone of voice may fail to reflect their feelings . Some use a high-pitched sing-song or a flat , robot-like voice . This can make it difficult for others know what they want and need . This failed communication , in turn , can lead to frustration and inappropriate behavior ( such as screaming or grabbing ) on the part of the person with autism . Fortunately , there are proven methods for helping children and adults with autism learn better ways to express their needs . As the person with autism learns to communicate what he or she wants , challenging behaviors often subside . ( See section on Treatments . ) Repetitive Behaviors Unusual repetitive behaviors and / or a tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities are another core symptom of autism . Common repetitive behaviors include hand-flapping , rocking , jumping and twirling , arranging and rearranging objects , and repeating sounds , words , or phrases . Sometimes the repetitive behavior is self-stimulating , such as wiggling fingers in front of the eyes . The tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities can be seen in the way that many children with autism play with toys . Some spend hours lining up toys in a specific way instead of using them for pretend play . Similarly , some adults are preoccupied with having household or other objects in a fixed order or place . It can prove extremely upsetting if someone or something disrupts the order . Along these lines many children and adults with autism need and demand extreme consistency in their environment and daily routine . Slight changes can be extremely stressful and lead to outbursts Repetitive behaviors can take the form of intense preoccupations , or obsessions . These extreme interests can prove all the more unusual for their content ( e.g. fans , vacuum cleaners or toilets ) or depth of knowledge ( e.g. knowing and repeating astonishingly detailed information about Thomas the Tank Engine or astronomy ) . Older children and adults with autism may develop tremendous interest in numbers , symbols , dates or science topics . Associated Medical Conditions Thanks to donor support , Autism Speaks continues to fund research into the causes and treatment of the medical conditions associated with ASD . You can explore these studies here . This research is reflected in the comprehensive care model at the heart of our Autism Treatment Network ( ATN ) clinics . To find out if there is an ATN clinic close to you , click here . For in depth information on medical conditions , please see our website's related pages : "" Treatments for Associated Medical Conditions "" and "" What Treatments are Available for Speech , Language and Motor Impairments , "" in addition to the information below . Genetic Disorders Some children with autism have an identifiable genetic condition that affects brain development . These genetic disorders include Fragile X syndrome , Angelman syndrome , tuberous sclerosis and chromosome 15 duplication syndrome and other single-gene and chromosomal disorders . While further study is needed , single gene disorders appear to affect 15 to 20 percent of those with ASD . Some of these syndromes have characteristic features or family histories , the presence of which may prompt your doctor to refer to a geneticist or neurologist for further testing . The results can help guide treatment , awareness of associated medical issues and life planning . Gastrointestinal ( GI ) Disorders GI distress is common among persons with autism , and affects up to 85 percent of children with ASD . These conditions range in severity from a tendency for chronic constipation or diarrhea to inflammatory bowel disease . Pain caused by GI issues can prompt behavioral changes such as increased self soothing ( rocking , head banging , etc ) or outbursts of aggression or self-injury . Conversely , appropriate treatment can improve behavior and quality of life . Please see our treatment section on "" Gastrointestinal Disorders . "" It includes discussion of popular dietary interventions . Thanks to donor support , Autism Speaks continues to fund research into causes and treatments . Seizure Disorders Seizure disorders , including epilepsy , occur in as many as 39 percent of those with autism . It is more common in people with autism who also have intellectual disability than those without . Someone with autism may experience more than one type of seizure . The easiest to recognize is the grand mal , or tonic-clonic , seizure . Others include "" petit mal "" seizures ( when a person temporarily appears "" absent "" ) and subclinical seizures , which may be apparent only with electroencephalogram ( EEG ) testing . Sleep Dysfunction Sleep problems are common among children and adolescents with autism and may likewise affect many adults . For more information and helpful guidance , see our ATN Sleep Strategies Tool Kit ( available for free download ) . Sensory Processing Problems Many persons with autism have unusual responses to sensory input . They have difficulty processing and integrating sensory information , or stimuli , such as sights , sounds smells , tastes and / or movement . They may experience seemingly ordinary stimuli as painful , unpleasant or confusing . ( Explore our donor-funded research on causes and treatments here . ) Some of those with autism are hypersensitive to sounds or touch , a condition also known as sensory defensiveness . Others are under-responsive , or hyposensitive . An example of hypersensitivity would be the inability to tolerate wearing clothing , being touched or being in a room with normal lighting . Hyposensitivity can include failure to respond when one's name is called . Many sensory processing problems can be addressed with occupational therapy and / or sensory integration therapy .

763	Stem cells reside in small numbers in most body tissues and control the healing processes subsequent to disease or injury . Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) can produce various different tissue types including bone , cartilage and fat . However , the mechanisms by which different tissue types are produced from MSCs is very complex and therefore difficult to understand using intuition alone . Mathematical models provide a means to analyse complex systems such as the mesenchymal stem cell system . Therefore we propose an innovative approach to analyse how bone tissue is produced with the help of mathematical modelling in conjunction with experimentation . In particular we will use mathematical models to examine how gene expression correlates with stem cell activity and , significantly , how this correlation changes with age .	Information/Explanation

1411	What Teeth Do Kids Lose and When ? If all your kids want for Christmas ( or Halloween , or Easter ) is their two front teeth , chances are , they 're about six years old . While the timing and order of losing teeth varies , there are a few basics you should know about what teeth kids lose â and when . There may be a few exceptions , but for the most part , kids lose teeth in the order that they received them in the first place . If you remember taking photos of little Tommy's first tooth , you may already have a pretty good idea of which baby tooth will be the first to go . For most kids , the first baby teeth lost are the lower central incisors and the upper central incisors . These , for the non-dental world , are known as the two upper front teeth and the two lower front teeth . While the incisors will fall out around six to seven years of age , you may be wondering the timing of the other teeth . The other teeth , including the first and second molars , will fall out by age 11 or twelve . What Teeth do Kids Lose ? Well , all of them â all of their baby teeth , that is . Kids get 20 baby teeth , starting from infancy . Most kids will have all 20 baby teeth by the time they 're three years old . And once those choppers are in , you may wonder how important it is to properly care for these temporary residents . Answer â pretty important ! Even though you know what teeth your kids will lose , there are some compelling reasons for keeping those baby teeth in ship-shape . Improper care of baby teeth can lead to gum disease , jaw and teeth spacing issues , and even painful chewing , which may create poor nutritional habits . When it 's time for the baby teeth to drop out , make sure your kids ( or you ! ) do n't yank them out prematurely . While it 's okay to gently wobble and loosen a loose tooth , yanking one out before it 's ready to go can lead to root infection . Got any questions about baby teeth ? Give us a call today ! Unless , of course , you 're asking about the tooth fairy , in which case we 've been sworn to secrecy !	Instruction
1412	"When it comes to their planning process , many financial institutions choose to stay the course and execute , not sure that an updated planning effort would be worth it . But that 's not the sentiment that resonates among banking industry outperformers , who regard their planning process as essential to achieving business alignment and focused execution . They aim to formulate a plan that illustrates the value proposition that will attract and retain customers , and the strengths that will enable the business to deliver this value to customers , while simultaneously earning an attractive return-on-equity . As a result , and perhaps not surprisingly , these companies enjoy strong organic growth and higher shareholder returns . That makes sense . Their customers are served distinctively , while internally , managers reach decisions effectively and efficiently . However , the majority of financial services executives say that the frustrations that go along with strategic planning are holding them back . We often hear complaints such as , "" Let 's face it ... we call it a strategic planning process , but it 's actually just a financial forecasting effort , "" or , "" Our consultants delivered a fat book full of urban legend assertions , but we would have been better off with a thin one that really got to the essence of what we should do to gain profitable share . "" Characteristics of a Broken Planning Process Ineffective strategic planning processes have several unfortunate outcomes . They often emphasize tactics and not strategy , and then end in a "" cram-down stage "" that leaves a bad taste among participants . As one business manager commented , "" We spent hundreds of man-hours planning a business , and then we were told all of us had 10 % revenue growth and 3 % cost growth bogeys . "" Another common outcome is financial forecasts that are infeasible to fund . When this occurs , business managers will inevitably be asked to reformulate their plans to meet Wall Street's short-term expectations . Problems also occur when too many viewpoints are accommodated under a collegial , "" group-think "" approach . Resulting plans often end up describing broad concepts for how the business will differentiate itself . These compromises accommodate the group , but do not provide the context for making tough allocation of resources decisions â which is , after all , the essence of strategy . Eliminating Low Value , Costly Distractions Plans that claim to offer "" everything for everyone "" are more expensive and run a high risk of becoming "" great intentions , never realized . "" These problems result in a set of tactical initiatives to cut costs and a half-hearted commitment to the revenue plan , exacerbated by a lack of differentiation in the market . Everyone ends up being disappointed â most silently , some vocally . To avoid low value , costly distractions , executives should take a more constructive approach to strategic planning . Spend time developing and gaining consensus on a more focused value proposition and determine the implications for prioritizing initiatives , while deprioritizing others . Steps for Effective Planning Devising a strategic plan that ultimately aligns a company's business segments , and propels organic growth and shareholder returns requires an internal analysis of the institution and its objectives in the marketplace . Call it a four-part process , in which executives will first , clearly identify and communicate financial goals to their company and ask senior management to answer fundamental questions such as , "" why would prospects choose to bank with us ? "" Then , executives must review their new value-driven plan and commit to making it the basis for the company's future strategy and eliminate discretionary investments and activities that are not central to the strategy . 1 . Spell It Out : At the outset , executive management should be clear in communicating the goals for the corporation , including any "" must have "" financial objectives . Ideally , this step should also include guidance for each line of business . For example , one unit may be challenged to grow faster than the market while maintaining its profitability ; another may be told to fix its low margins before emphasizing growth . 2 . The Litmus Test : As each unit prepares its strategy , management should make sure that each strategy includes consideration of the fundamental issues that , once resolved , will guide decisions on allocation of resources and will focus execution . One way to help business heads and planners understand how to approach planning is to adopt an entrepreneur's mindset . Produce a strategy that would stand up to the scrutiny of an independent venture capital or private equity firm that you wish to attract an investment from by addressing the following four areas : W hat the business will achieve : Although this is a derivative of the strategy and should be completed last , it 's is often the first topic to be discussed with executive management in the strategy review . It 's mostly composed of financial goals , but the best plans will also highlight the competencies that are important to the business' competitiveness . Where the business will compete : Examine the criteria to be used to decide where in the competitive landscape to focus . Typically , this is based on analysis of growth and ROE potential . These criteria should guide specific recommendations for the types of customers to target , the products and channels to emphasize , and the geographies on which to focus . How the business will win : One of the most critically important steps in strategic planning is determining how the business will be successful . If it 's not compelling , the value of planning will be substantially compromised . The strategy must be as straightforward and specific as possible in describing the value proposition that will motivate customers to do business with your bank versus competitors . Once defined , a companion section should describe how value will be provided at a cost that will enable the business to generate attractive economics . Finally , if acquisitions are envisioned , this section should explain their contribution to the strategy and how the acquisition premium will be earned back . Â· How the business will be managed : It is important to highlight those aspects of the organization design , management processes , performance measures , culture , and incentives that will be aligned with the strategy . Someone reading this section should be able to understand how the recommended approach will facilitate achievement of the goals . It is critically important to align the metrics and incentive plan . Without such alignment , people will continue to do what makes their wallets bulge , and you might as well delete the strategy before you even print it out . 3 . Recap : At this point , reviews should be held with senior management . Such reviews should begin with a discussion of the proposed value proposition : Will customers be motivated ? Business managers should be asked , "" Okay , let 's pretend I am a prospect in your target market . Tell me in a straightforward manner ... why should I do business with you instead of your competitors ? "" If the answer to this question is not compelling , the business needs to rethink its value proposition . The worst case occurs when the business seeks to be distinctive in too many dimensions , e.g. , convenience , service quality , price , and segmentation . This is the state of affairs in most banks that are losing share . More subtle , but also problematic , is deciding that , for example , "" We will win with superior service "" without defining precisely what aspects of service will be distinctive . This leads to a false sense of consensus that later breaks down as management grapples with a myriad of investment proposals and activities to be approved which all appear consistent with a strategy that is too broad . What is really needed is more precise resolution of whether the service strategy will focus on having fewer errors , showing customers respect , offering superior hours for convenience , being hassle-free and easy to do business with , offering more personalized banking , etc. Once the answer to the "" why should I do business with you "" question is concise and convincing , then the business team should be asked , "" Now tell me how you are going to deliver this extra value to customers and still achieve an attractive return on equity . That is , what will be the behind-the-scenes competencies that will underpin success ? "" Present the plan as if to a venture capitalist who is being asked to invest It is essential to achieve clarity and buy-in on the answers to the two fundamental questions noted above during a friendly but rigorous scrutiny of the strategy . If full buy-in is achieved , execution alignment can be accomplished . Even 75 % buy-in will not be enough , as the 25 % outliers will hinder efficient decision-making , delay execution , add complexity , and cause the organization to be more confused than efficient . Buy-in failure essentially guarantees ineffective execution . So , the quality of the answers to these questions is the critical determinant of whether ( i ) the effort is strategic , ( ii ) top management will fund , and ( iii ) the initiatives will lead to focused action . 4 . Talk the talk and walk the walk : Finally , and ideally after they are approved by top management , strategic plans should become the basis for next year's financial plan . Only after the strategic plan has been challenged , refined , and accepted should budget detail for its first year be constructed . Creating the budget at this point is more efficient , as it is now less likely to need revision , and adds value by further validating â or challenging â the near-term aspects of the strategic plan . It is also vital that periodic reviews include a discussion of strategic milestones that are not financial in nature , i.e. , the key initiatives and leading indicators that will drive the financials . More quality thinking ... less make-work Ensuring that these four steps are in place will go a long way toward making a planning process successful . At best-practice institutions , the whole planning process is frequently so well honed that it can start a mere four to five months before the fiscal year-end . Such institutions often start in mid-August , with the initial top-down corporate plan developed in September and the individual business planning cycle running from mid-September to November . Budgets come to their conclusion in early to mid-December . Boards are presented with and asked to approve strategic and financial plans in mid - to late December , and receive the final budget in January . Does this "" best practice "" approach require more effort ? Certainly it mandates disciplined thinking about your customer needs , your value proposition relative to that of the competition and how you will deliver that value at an attractive return . However , if there is less make-work , the odds of a failed process are dramatically reduced ."	Instruction

Instead of saying "" You got 73,000 results . This one through 20 . Next , "" they just give you as many O 's as there are pages . It 's really simple and subtle . I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it . That 's the subconscious mind that sort of notices it , it probably is kind of pleasant and you did n't know why . And it 's just clever . And of course , what 's especially good , if you type "" design and emotion , "" the first response out of those 10 pages is my website . ( Laughter ) Now , the weird thing is Google lies because if I type "" design and emotion , "" it says , "" You do n't need the ' and . ' We do it anyway . "" So , OK . So I type "" design emotion "" and my website was n ' t first again . It was third . Oh well , different story . There was this wonderful review in The New York Times about the MINI Cooper automobile . It said , "" You know , this is a car that has lots of faults . Buy it anyway . It 's so much fun to drive . "" And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean , I wanted to see , I rented it , this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car , the whole design is fun . It 's round , it 's neat . The controls work wonderfully . So that 's my new life , it 's all about fun . I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better , and that never made any sense to me until I finally figured out , look ... I 'm going to put a plank on the ground . So , imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long and I 'm going to walk on it , and you see I can walk on it without looking , I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down . No problem . Now I 'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air and I 'm not going to go near it , thank you . Intense fear paralyzes you . It actually affects the way the brain works . So , Paul Saffo , just before his talk said that he did n't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk , and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus And that 's what fear and anxiety does It causes you to be -- what 's called depth-first processing -- to focus , not be distracted , and I could n ' t force myself across that . Now some people can -- circus workers , steel workers . But it really changes the way you think . And then , a psychologist , Alice Isen , did this wonderful experiment . She brought students in to solve problems So , she 'd bring people into the room , there 'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here and an empty room , except a table with a bunch of crap on it -- some papers and scissors and stuff . And she 'd bring them in , and she 'd say , "" This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life . Would you tie those two strings together ? "" So they 'd take one string and they 'd pull it over here and they could n ' t reach the other string . Still ca n ' t reach it . And , basically none of them could solve it . You bring in a second group of people , and you say , "" Oh , before we start , I got this box of candy , and I do n't eat candy . Would you like the box of candy ? "" And turns out they liked it , and it made them happy , not very happy , but a little bit of happy . And guess what -- they solved the problem . And it turns out that when you 're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain , which focuses you makes you depth-first , And when you 're happy -- what we call positive valence -- you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes , which makes you a breadth-first problem solver you 're more susceptible to interruption , you do out of the box thinking . That 's what brainstorming 's about , right ? With brainstorming we make you happy , we play games , and we say , "" No criticism , "" and you get all these weird , neat ideas . But in fact , if that 's how you always were you 'd never get any work done because you 'd be working along and say , "" Oh , I got a new way of doing it . "" So to get work done , you 've got to set a deadline , right ? You 've got be anxious . So the brain works differently and if you 're happy , things work better because you 're more creative You get a little problem , you say , "" Ah , I 'll figure it out . "" No big deal . There 's something I call the visceral level of processing . Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors . That 's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants , because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed . There 's an amazing amount of stuff that 's built into the brain . We dislike bitter tastes , we dislike loud sounds , we dislike hot temperatures , cold temperatures . We dislike scolding voices , we dislike frowning faces , We like symmetrical faces , et cetera , et cetera . So that 's the visceral level and in design you can express visceral in lots of ways , like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot , exciting . Or the 1963 Jaguar . It 's actually a crummy car , falls apart all the time , but the owners love it . And it 's beautiful -- it 's in the Museum of Modern Art . A water bottle . You buy it because of the bottle , not because of the water . And when people are finished , they do n't throw it away they keep it for -- you know , it 's like the old wine bottles , you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again , which proves it 's not the water . It 's all about the visceral experience . The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that 's actually where most of our stuff gets done . Visceral is subconscious , you 're unaware of it Behavioral is subconscious , you 're unaware of it . Almost everything we do is subconscious . I 'm walking around the stage , I 'm not attending to the control of my legs . I 'm doing a lot , most of my talk is subconscious , it 's been rehearsed and thought about a lot . Most of what we do is subconscious . Automatic behavior -- skilled behavior is subconscious , controlled by the behavioral side . And behavioral design is all about feeling in control , which includes usability , understanding , but also the feel and heft . That 's why the Global knives are so neat . They 're so nicely balanced , so sharp , you really feel you 're in control of the cutting . Or just driving a high-performance sports car over a demanding curb , again feeling that you are in complete control of the environment . Or the sensual feeling . This is a Kohler shower , a waterfall shower , and actually , all those knobs beneath are also shower heads . It will squirt you all around And you can stay in that shower for hours . And not waste water , by the way , it recirculates the same dirty water . ( Laughter ) Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago . It 's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot . That 's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back , and you put tea in , and then you fill it with water because water then seeps over the tea . And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line . There 's a little ledge inside , so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that . And when the tea is ready , or almost ready , you tilt it . And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing . And when it 's finished , you put it vertically , and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line and the water only comes to here and so it keeps the tea out And on top of that , it communicates , which is what emotion does . Emotion is all about acting , emotion is really about acting . It 's being safe in the world . Cognition is about understanding the world , emotion is about interpreting it saying good , bad , safe , dangerous , and getting us ready to act , which is why the muscles tense or relax . And that 's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else , because their muscles are acting , subconsciously , except that we 've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion . Well , this has emotions if you like , because it signals the waiter that , "" Hey , I 'm finished . See -- upright . "" And the waiter can come by and say , "" Would you like more water ? "" It 's kind of neat . What a wonderful design . And the third level is reflective , which is , if you like the superego , it 's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do , no control over the -- does n ' t see the senses , does n ' t control the muscles . It looks over what 's going on . It 's that little voice in your head . that 's watching and saying , "" That 's good . That 's bad . "" or "" Why are you doing that ? I do n't understand . "" It 's that little voice in your head that 's the seat of consciousness . Here 's a great reflective product . Owners of the Hummer have said , "" You know I 've owned many cars in my life all sorts of exotic cars , but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention . "" It 's about their image , it 's not about the car . But even if you want a more positive model , this is the GM car . And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment And you 'll buy it to protect the environment , even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected . But that 's reflective design as well . Or an expensive watch so you can impress people , who say "" Oh gee , I did n't know you had that watch . "" As opposed to this one , which is a pure behavioral watch , which probably keeps better time than the 13,000 dollar watch I just showed you . But it 's ugly . This is a clear Don Norman watch . And what 's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other , the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying "" It 's OK . It 's OK . It 's safe . It 's safe . "" If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart , you 'd never go on the ride . So , it 's pitting one against the other . The other neat thing ( Laughter ) So Jake Cress is this furniture maker , and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture . And this is his chair with claw , and the poor little chair has lost its ball and it 's trying to get it back before anybody notices . And what 's so neat about it is how you accept that story . And that 's what 's nice about emotion . So that 's the new me . I 'm only saying positive things from now on . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) </content"	Information/Explanation

1659	N. spatulata has been identified from a single location in the Clarno Formation , the Clarno nut beds , type locality for both the formation and the species . The nut beds are approximately 3 kilometres ( 1 . 9 mi ) east of the unincorporated community of Clarno , Oregon , and considered to be middle Eocene in age , based on averaging zircon fission track radiometric dating which yielded an age of 43.6 and 43.7 Â± 10 million years ago and Argon â argon dating radiometric dating which yielded a 36.38 Â± 1.31 to 46.8 Â± 3.36 mya date . The average of the dates resulted in an age range of 45 to 43 mya . The beds are composed of silica and calcium carbonate cemented tuffaceous sandstones , siltstones , and conglomerates which preserve either a lake delta environment , or alternatively periodic floods and volcanic mudflows preserved with hot spring activity . The species was described from a series of type specimens , the holotype specimen USNM 422378 , which was preserved in the paleobotanical collections of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C. and four paratype specimens . Two of the paratypes were also in the national Museum collections , while the remaining two were in the University of Florida collections in Gainsville , Florida . The fossils were part of a group of approximately 20,000 specimens collected from 1942 to 1989 by Thomas Bones , Alonzo W. Hancock , R. A. Scott , Steven R. Manchester , and a number of high school students . The N. spatulata specimens were first studied by graduate student R. A. Scott , who placed the species into the extinct genus Palaeonyssa as Palaeonyssa spatulata , with the 1954 type description of the species appearing in the journal Palaeontographica . Palaeonyssa was first described by Eleanor Reid and Marjorie Chandler from fossils preserved in the London Clay , with them describing several species in the genus . N. spatulata was re-examined by paleobotanist Steven R. Manchester of the University of Florida , who published a 1994 re-description for the species in the Journal Palaeontographica Americana . In the re-description Manchester noted there was very little difference between the extinct genus Palaeonyssa and the modern Nyssa , and deemed the two to be the same genus . The merging resulted in the recombination of Palaeonyssa spatulata as Nyssa spatulata . The fruits of N. spatulata have a generally rounded triangular to round endocarp in cross-section and are trilocular , similar to the extant N. talamancana . The outline of the endocarps is oblong to ellipsoid , having both apex and base rounded and showing 9 ridges running the length of the endocarp from base to apex . The fruits have an average length of 24 mm ( 0 . 94 in ) though lengths of 30 mm ( 1 . 2 in ) are seen . Similarly while the average girth of the fruits is 14.6 mm ( 0 . 57 in ) , thicker fruits reaching 21.5 mm ( 0 . 85 in ) are known . Each of the three locules has a slit like opening along the upper half of the endocarp , and are separated from each other by a wall of swirling groups of fibers . There is one seed per locule , with the locule having a c-shaped cross section , the chamber opening near the apex and narrowing near the base .	Information/Explanation
1008	"Pay deals are running below the rate of inflation for the first time in over a year , new research has shown . Average settlements were worth 3 % in the quarter to June , 0.3 % below the retail prices index , according to a study of more than 130 agreements . Pay specialists Industrial Relations Services said half of the deals it monitored were worth less than a year ago .

"" However , ability to pay also plays a part in pay bargaining , with many employers citing rising energy costs as a barrier to higher pay deals . """	News
54	"11 IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS His visit to M. de Treville being paid , the pensive d ' Artagnan took the longest way homeward . On what was d ' Artagnan thinking , that he strayed thus from his path , gazing at the stars of heaven , and sometimes sighing , sometimes smiling ? He was thinking of Mme . Bonacieux . For an apprentice Musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love . Pretty , mysterious , initiated in almost all the secrets of the court , which reflected such a charming gravity over her pleasing features , it might be surmised that she was not wholly unmoved ; and this is an irresistible charm to novices in love . Moreover , d ' Artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her ; and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character . D ' Artagnan already fancied himself , so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination , accosted by a messenger from the young woman , who brought him some billet appointing a meeting , a gold chain , or a diamond . We have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame . Let us add that in these times of lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses ; and that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable remembrances , as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts . Without a blush , men made their way in the world by the means of women blushing . Such as were only beautiful gave their beauty , whence , without doubt , comes the proverb , "" The most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has . "" Such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money ; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place , nor their battles afterward , without the purse , more or less furnished , which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow . D ' Artagnan owned nothing . Provincial diffidence , that slight varnish , the ephemeral flower , that down of the peach , had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three Musketeers gave their friend . D ' Artagnan , following the strange custom of the times , considered himself at Paris as on a campaign , neither more nor less than if he had been in Flanders--Spain yonder , woman here . In each there was an enemy to contend with , and contributions to be levied . But , we must say , at the present moment d ' Artagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested . The mercer had said that he was rich ; the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as M. Bonacieux ; and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love , which had been the consequence of it . We say ALMOST , for the idea that a young , handsome , kind , and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love , but on the contrary strengthens it . There are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty . A fine and white stocking , a silken robe , a lace kerchief , a pretty slipper on the foot , a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty , but they make a pretty woman beautiful , without reckoning the hands , which gain by all this ; the hands , among women particularly , to be beautiful must be idle . Then d ' Artagnan , as the reader , from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune , very well knows--d ' Artagnan was not a millionaire ; he hoped to become one someday , but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant . In the meanwhile , how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a woman's happiness , and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings . At least , when the woman is rich and the lover is not , that which he can not offer she offers to herself ; and although it is generally with her husband's money that she procures herself this indulgence , the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him . Then d ' Artagnan , disposed to become the most tender of lovers , was at the same time a very devoted friend , In the midst of his amorous projects for the mercer's wife , he did not forget his friends . The pretty Mme . Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain St. Denis or in the fair of St. Germain , in company with Athos , Porthos , and Aramis , to whom d ' Artagnan had often remarked this . Then one could enjoy charming little dinners , where one touches on one side the hand of a friend , and on the other the foot of a mistress . Besides , on pressing occasions , in extreme difficulties , d ' Artagnan would become the preserver of his friends . And M. Bonacieux ? whom d ' Artagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers , denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him . We are compelled to admit to our readers that d ' Artagnan thought nothing about him in any way ; or that if he did think of him , it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was , wherever it might be . Love is the most selfish of all the passions . Let our readers reassure themselves . IF d ' Artagnan forgets his host , or appears to forget him , under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried , we will not forget him , and we know where he is . But for the moment , let us do as did the amorous Gascon ; we will see after the worthy mercer later . D ' Artagnan , reflecting on his future amours , addressing himself to the beautiful night , and smiling at the stars , ascended the Rue Cherish-Midi , or Chase-Midi , as it was then called . As he found himself in the quarter in which Aramis lived , he took it into his head to pay his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to send Planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the mousetrap . Now , if Aramis had been at home when Planchet came to his abode , he had doubtless hastened to the Rue des Fossoyeurs , and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps , they would not be able to conceive what all this meant . This mystery required an explanation ; at least , so d ' Artagnan declared to himself . He likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty little Mme . Bonacieux , of whom his head , if not his heart , was already full . We must never look for discretion in first love . First love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow , it will stifle you . Paris for two hours past had been dark , and seemed a desert . Eleven o ' clock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg St. Germain . It was delightful weather . D ' Artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the Rue d ' Assas is now situated , breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the Rue de Vaugirard , and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night . From a distance resounded , deadened , however , by good shutters , the songs of the tipplers , enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain . Arrived at the end of the lane , d ' Artagnan turned to the left . The house in which Aramis dwelt was situated between the Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandoni . D ' Artagnan had just passed the Rue Cassette , and already perceived the door of his friend's house , shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it , when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the Rue Servandoni . This something was enveloped in a cloak , and d ' Artagnan at first believed it was a man ; but by the smallness of the form , the hesitation of the walk , and the indecision of the step , he soon discovered that it was a woman . Further , this woman , as if not certain of the house she was seeking , lifted up her eyes to look around her , stopped , went backward , and then returned again . D ' Artagnan was perplexed . "" Shall I go and offer her my services ? "" thought he . "" By her step she must be young ; perhaps she is pretty . Oh , yes ! But a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover . If I should disturb a rendezvous , that would not be the best means of commencing an acquaintance . "" Meantime the young woman continued to advance , counting the houses and windows . This was neither long nor difficult . There were but three hotels in this part of the street ; and only two windows looking toward the road , one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis occupied , the other belonging to Aramis himself . "" PARIDIEU ! "" said d ' Artagnan to himself , to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted , "" PARDIEU , it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend's house . But on my soul , it looks so . Ah , my dear Aramis , this time I shall find you out . "" And d ' Artagnan , making himself as small as he could , concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche . The young woman continued to advance ; and in addition to the lightness of her step , which had betrayed her , she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice . D ' Artagnan believed this cough to be a signal . Nevertheless , whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker , or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey , she resolutely drew near to Aramis's shutter , and tapped , at three equal intervals , with her bent finger . "" This is all very fine , dear Aramis , "" murmured d ' Artagnan . "" Ah , Monsieur Hypocrite , I understand how you study theology . "" The three blows were scarcely struck , when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter . "" Ah , ah ! "" said the listener , "" not through doors , but through windows ! Ah , this visit was expected . We shall see the windows open , and the lady enter by escalade . Very pretty ! "" But to the great astonishment of d ' Artagnan , the shutter remained closed . Still more , the light which had shone for an instant disappeared , and all was again in obscurity . D ' Artagnan thought this could not last long , and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears . He was right ; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside . The young woman in the street replied by a single tap , and the shutter was opened a little way . It may be judged whether d ' Artagnan looked or listened with avidity . Unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber ; but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night . Besides , the eyes of the Gascons have , as it is asserted , like those of cats , the faculty of seeing in the dark . D ' Artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object , which she unfolded quickly , and which took the form of a handkerchief . She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object . This immediately recalled to d ' Artagnan's mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of Mme . Bonacieux , which had reminded him of that which he had dragged from under the feet of Aramis . "" What the devil could that handkerchief signify ? "" Placed where he was , d ' Artagnan could not perceive the face of Aramis . We say Aramis , because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior . Curiosity prevailed over prudence ; and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene , he stole from his hiding place , and quick as lightning , but stepping with utmost caution , he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall , from which his eye could pierce the interior of Aramis's room . Upon gaining this advantage d ' Artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise ; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor , it was a woman ! D ' Artagnan , however , could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments , not enough to distinguish her features . At the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket , and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her . Then some words were spoken by the two women . At length the shutter closed . The woman who was outside the window turned round , and passed within four steps of d ' Artagnan , pulling down the hood of her mantle ; but the precaution was too late , d ' Artagnan had already recognized Mme . Bonacieux . Mme . Bonacieux ! The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of d ' Artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket ; but what probability was there that Mme . Bonacieux , who had sent for M. Laporte in order to be reconducted to the Louvre , should be running about the streets of Paris at half past eleven at night , at the risk of being abducted a second time ? This must be , then , an affair of importance ; and what is the most important affair to a woman of twenty-five ! Love . But was it on her own account , or on account of another , that she exposed herself to such hazards ? This was a question the young man asked himself , whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed , being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted lover . There was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither Mme . Bonacieux was going ; that was to follow her . This method was so simple that d ' Artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively . But at the sight of the young man , who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche , and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her , Mme . Bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled . D ' Artagnan ran after her . It was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her cloak . He came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street . The unfortunate woman was exhausted , not by fatigue , but by terror , and when d ' Artagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder , she sank upon one knee , crying in a choking voice , "" Kill me , if you please , you shall know nothing ! "" D ' Artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist ; but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting , he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness . These protestations were nothing for Mme . Bonacieux , for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world ; but the voice was all . Mme . Bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice ; she reopened her eyes , cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so , and at once perceiving it was d ' Artagnan , she uttered a cry of joy , "" Oh , it is you , it is you ! Thank God , thank God ! "" "" Yes , it is I , "" said d ' Artagnan , "" it is I , whom God has sent to watch over you . "" "" Was it with that intention you followed me ? "" asked the young woman , with a coquettish smile , whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence , and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy . "" No , "" said d ' Artagnan ; "" no , I confess it . It was chance that threw me in your way ; I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends . "" "" One of your friends ? "" interrupted Mme . Bonacieux . "" Without doubt ; Aramis is one of my best friends . "" "" Aramis ! Who is he ? "" "" Come , come , you wo n ' t tell me you do n't know Aramis ? "" "" This is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced . "" "" It is the first time , then , that you ever went to that house ? "" "" Undoubtedly . "" "" And you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man ? "" "" No. "" "" By a Musketeer ? "" "" No , indeed ! "" "" It was not he , then , you came to seek ? "" "" Not the least in the world . Besides , you must have seen that the person to whom I spoke was a woman . "" "" That is true ; but this woman is a friend of Aramis -- "" "" I know nothing of that . "" "" -- since she lodges with him . "" "" That does not concern me . "" "" But who is she ? "" "" Oh , that is not my secret . "" "" My dear Madame Bonacieux , you are charming ; but at the same time you are one of the most mysterious women . "" "" Do I lose by that ? "" "" No ; you are , on the contrary , adorable . "" "" Give me your arm , then . "" "" Most willingly . And now ? "" "" Now escort me . "" "" Where ? "" "" Where I am going . "" "" But where are you going ? "" "" You will see , because you will leave me at the door . "" "" Shall I wait for you ? "" "" That will be useless . "" "" You will return alone , then ? "" "" Perhaps yes , perhaps no . "" "" But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman ? "" "" I do n't know yet . "" "" But I will know it ! "" "" How so ? "" "" I will wait until you come out . "" "" In that case , adieu . "" "" Why so ? "" "" I do not want you . "" "" But you have claimed -- "" "" The aid of a gentleman , not the watchfulness of a spy . "" "" The word is rather hard . "" "" How are they called who follow others in spite of them ? "" "" They are indiscreet . "" "" The word is too mild . "" "" Well , madame , I perceive I must do as you wish . "" "" Why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once ? "" "" Is there no merit in repentance ? "" "" And do you really repent ? "" "" I know nothing about it myself . But what I know is that I promise to do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are going . "" "" And you will leave me then ? "" "" Yes . "" "" Without waiting for my coming out again ? "" "" Yes . "" "" Word of honor ? "" "" By the faith of a gentleman . Take my arm , and let us go . "" D ' Artagnan offered his arm to Mme . Bonacieux , who willingly took it , half laughing , half trembling , and both gained the top of Rue de la Harpe . Arriving there , the young woman seemed to hesitate , as she had before done in the Rue Vaugirard . She seemed , however , by certain signs , to recognize a door , and approaching that door , "" And now , monsieur , "" said she , "" it is here I have business ; a thousand thanks for your honorable company , which has saved me from all the dangers to which , alone I was exposed . But the moment is come to keep your word ; I have reached my destination . "" "" And you will have nothing to fear on your return ? "" "" I shall have nothing to fear but robbers . "" "" And that is nothing ? "" "" What could they take from me ? I have not a penny about me . "" "" You forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms . "" "" Which ? "" "" That which I found at your feet , and replaced in your pocket . "" "" Hold your tongue , imprudent man ! Do you wish to destroy me ? "" "" You see very plainly that there is still danger for you , since a single word makes you tremble ; and you confess that if that word were heard you would be ruined . Come , come , madame ! "" cried d ' Artagnan , seizing her hands , and surveying her with an ardent glance , "" come , be more generous . Confide in me . Have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart ? "" "" Yes , "" replied Mme . Bonacieux ; "" therefore , ask my own secrets , and I will reveal them to you ; but those of others--that is quite another thing . "" "" Very well , "" said d ' Artagnan , "" I shall discover them ; as these secrets may have an influence over your life , these secrets must become mine . "" "" Beware of what you do ! "" cried the young woman , in a manner so serious as to make d ' Artagnan start in spite of himself . "" Oh , meddle in nothing which concerns me . Do not seek to assist me in that which I am accomplishing . This I ask of you in the name of the interest with which I inspire you , in the name of the service you have rendered me and which I never shall forget while I have life . Rather , place faith in what I tell you . Have no more concern about me ; I exist no longer for you , any more than if you had never seen me . "" "" Must Aramis do as much as I , madame ? "" said d ' Artagnan , deeply piqued . "" This is the second or third time , monsieur , that you have repeated that name , and yet I have told you that I do not know him . "" "" You do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked ? Indeed , madame , you believe me too credulous ! "" "" Confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this personage . "" "" I invent nothing , madame ; I create nothing . I only speak that exact truth . "" "" And you say that one of your friends lives in that house ? "" "" I say so , and I repeat it for the third time ; that house is one inhabited by my friend , and that friend is Aramis . "" "" All this will be cleared up at a later period , "" murmured the young woman ; "" no , monsieur , be silent . "" "" If you could see my heart , "" said d ' Artagnan , "" you would there read so much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would instantly satisfy my curiosity . We have nothing to fear from those who love us . "" "" You speak very suddenly of love , monsieur , "" said the young woman , shaking her head . "" That is because love has come suddenly upon me , and for the first time ; and because I am only twenty . "" The young woman looked at him furtively . "" Listen ; I am already upon the scent , "" resumed d ' Artagnan . "" About three months ago I was near having a duel with Aramis concerning a handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his house--for a handkerchief marked in the same manner , I am sure . "" "" Monsieur , "" said the young woman , "" you weary me very much , I assure you , with your questions . "" "" But you , madame , prudent as you are , think , if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief , and that handkerchief were to be seized , would you not be compromised ? "" "" In what way ? The initials are only mine -- C. B. , Constance Bonacieux . "" "" Or Camille de Bois-Tracy . "" "" Silence , monsieur ! Once again , silence ! Ah , since the dangers I incur on my own account can not stop you , think of those you may yourself run ! "" "" Me ? "" "" Yes ; there is peril of imprisonment , risk of life in knowing me . "" "" Then I will not leave you . "" "" Monsieur ! "" said the young woman , supplicating him and clasping her hands together , "" monsieur , in the name of heaven , by the honor of a soldier , by the courtesy of a gentleman , depart ! There , there midnight sounds ! That is the hour when I am expected . "" "" Madame , "" said the young man , bowing ; "" I can refuse nothing asked of me thus . Be content ; I will depart . "" "" But you will not follow me ; you will not watch me ? "" "" I will return home instantly . "" "" Ah , I was quite sure you were a good and brave young man , "" said Mme . Bonacieux , holding out her hand to him , and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall . D ' Artagnan seized the hand held out to him , and kissed it ardently . "" Ah ! I wish I had never seen you ! "" cried d ' Artagnan , with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness , because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason . "" Well ! "" resumed Mme . Bonacieux , in a voice almost caressing , and pressing the hand of d ' Artagnan , who had not relinquished hers , "" well : I will not say as much as you do ; what is lost for today may not be lost forever . Who knows , when I shall be at liberty , that I may not satisfy your curiosity ? "" "" And will you make the same promise to my love ? "" cried d ' Artagnan , beside himself with joy . "" Oh , as to that , I do not engage myself . That depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire me . "" "" Then today , madame -- "" "" Oh , today , I am no further than gratitude . "" "" Ah ! You are too charming , "" said d ' Artagnan , sorrowfully ; "" and you abuse my love . "" "" No , I use your generosity , that 's all . But be of good cheer ; with certain people , everything comes round . "" "" Oh , you render me the happiest of men ! Do not forget this evening--do not forget that promise . "" "" Be satisfied . In the proper time and place I will remember everything . Now then , go , go , in the name of heaven ! I was expected at sharp midnight , and I am late . "" "" By five minutes . "" "" Yes ; but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages . "" "" When one loves . "" "" Well ! And who told you I had no affair with a lover ? "" "" It is a man , then , who expects you ? "" cried d ' Artagnan . "" A man ! "" "" The discussion is going to begin again ! "" said Mme . Bonacieux , with a half-smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience . "" No , no ; I go , I depart ! I believe in you , and I would have all the merit of my devotion , even if that devotion were stupidity . Adieu , madame , adieu ! "" And as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held , he sprang away , running , while Mme . Bonacieux knocked , as at the shutter , three light and regular taps . When he had gained the angle of the street , he turned . The door had been opened , and shut again ; the mercer's pretty wife had disappeared . D ' Artagnan pursued his way . He had given his word not to watch Mme . Bonacieux , and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her , d ' Artagnan would have returned home , since he had so promised . Five minutes later he was in the Rue des Fossoyeurs . "" Poor Athos ! "" said he ; "" he will never guess what all this means . He will have fallen asleep waiting for me , or else he will have returned home , where he will have learned that a woman had been there . A woman with Athos ! After all , "" continued d ' Artagnan , "" there was certainly one with Aramis . All this is very strange ; and I am curious to know how it will end . "" "" Badly , monsieur , badly ! "" replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of Planchet ; for , soliloquizing aloud , as very preoccupied people do , he had entered the alley , at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber . "" How badly ? What do you mean by that , you idiot ? "" asked d ' Artagnan . "" What has happened ? "" "" All sorts of misfortunes . "" "" What ? "" "" In the first place , Monsieur Athos is arrested . "" "" Arrested ! Athos arrested ! What for ? "" "" He was found in your lodging ; they took him for you . "" "" And by whom was he arrested ? "" "" By Guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight . "" "" Why did he not tell them his name ? Why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair ? "" "" He took care not to do so , monsieur ; on the contrary , he came up to me and said , ' It is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and not I , since he knows everything and I know nothing . They will believe he is arrested , and that will give him time ; in three days I will tell them who I am , and they can not fail to let me go . ' "" "" Bravo , Athos ! Noble heart ! "" murmured d ' Artagnan . "" I know him well there ! And what did the officers do ? "" "" Four conveyed him away , I do n't know where--to the Bastille or Fort l ' Eveque . Two remained with the men in black , who rummaged every place and took all the papers . The last two mounted guard at the door during this examination ; then , when all was over , they went away , leaving the house empty and exposed . "" "" And Porthos and Aramis ? "" "" I could not find them ; they did not come . "" "" But they may come any moment , for you left word that I awaited them ? "" "" Yes , monsieur . "" "" Well , do n't budge , then ; if they come , tell them what has happened . Let them wait for me at the Pomme-de-Pin . Here it would be dangerous ; the house may be watched . I will run to Monsieur de Treville to tell them all this , and will meet them there . "" "" Very well , monsieur , "" said Planchet . "" But you will remain ; you are not afraid ? "" said d ' Artagnan , coming back to recommend courage to his lackey . "" Be easy , monsieur , "" said Planchet ; "" you do not know me yet . I am brave when I set about it . It is all in beginning . Besides , I am a Picard . "" "" Then it is understood , "" said d ' Artagnan ; "" you would rather be killed than desert your post ? "" "" Yes , monsieur ; and there is nothing I would not do to prove to Monsieur that I am attached to him . "" "" Good ! "" said d ' Artagnan to himself . "" It appears that the method I have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best . I shall use it again upon occasion . "" And with all the swiftness of his legs , already a little fatigued however , with the perambulations of the day , d ' Artagnan directed his course toward M. de Treville's . M. de Treville was not at his hotel . His company was on guard at the Louvre ; he was at the Louvre with his company . It was necessary to reach M. de Treville ; it was important that he should be informed of what was passing . D ' Artagnan resolved to try and enter the Louvre . His costume of Guardsman in the company of M. Dessessart ought to be his passport . He therefore went down the Rue des Petits Augustins , and came up to the quay , in order to take the New Bridge . He had at first an idea of crossing by the ferry ; but on gaining the riverside , he had mechanically put his hand into his pocket , and perceived that he had not wherewithal to pay his passage . As he gained the top of the Rue Guenegaud , he saw two persons coming out of the Rue Dauphine whose appearance very much struck him . Of the two persons who composed this group , one was a man and the other a woman . The woman had the outline of Mme . Bonacieux ; the man resembled Aramis so much as to be mistaken for him . Besides , the woman wore that black mantle which d ' Artagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door of the Rue de la Harpe ; still further , the man wore the uniform of a Musketeer . The woman's hood was pulled down , and the man held a handkerchief to his face . Both , as this double precaution indicated , had an interest in not being recognized . They took the bridge . That was d ' Artagnan's road , as he was going to the Louvre . D ' Artagnan followed them . He had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really Mme . Bonacieux and that the man was Aramis . He felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his heart . He felt himself doubly betrayed , by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a mistress . Mme . Bonacieux had declared to him , by all the gods , that she did not know Aramis ; and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion , he found her hanging on the arm of Aramis . D ' Artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer's pretty wife for three hours ; that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black , who wished to carry her off , and that she had promised him nothing . He considered himself an outraged , betrayed , and ridiculed lover . Blood and anger mounted to his face ; he was resolved to unravel the mystery . The young man and young woman perceived they were watched , and redoubled their speed . D ' Artagnan determined upon his course . He passed them , then returned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine . Which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the bridge . D ' Artagnan stopped before them , and they stopped before him . "" What do you want , monsieur ? "" demanded the Musketeer , recoiling a step , and with a foreign accent , which proved to d ' Artagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures . "" It is not Aramis ! "" cried he . "" No , monsieur , it is not Aramis ; and by your exclamation I perceive you have mistaken me for another , and pardon you . "" "" You pardon me ? "" cried d ' Artagnan . "" Yes , "" replied the stranger . "" Allow me , then , to pass on , since it is not with me you have anything to do . "" "" You are right , monsieur , it is not with you that I have anything to do ; it is with Madame . "" "" With Madame ! You do not know her , "" replied the stranger . "" You are deceived , monsieur ; I know her very well . "" "" Ah , "" said Mme . Bonacieux ; in a tone of reproach , "" ah , monsieur , I had your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman . I hoped to be able to rely upon that . "" "" And I , madame ! "" said d ' Artagnan , embarrassed ; "" you promised me -- "" "" Take my arm , madame , "" said the stranger , "" and let us continue our way . "" D ' Artagnan , however , stupefied , cast down , annihilated by all that happened , stood , with crossed arms , before the Musketeer and Mme . Bonacieux . The Musketeer advanced two steps , and pushed d ' Artagnan aside with his hand . D ' Artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword . At the same time , and with the rapidity of lightning , the stranger drew his . "" In the name of heaven , my Lord ! "" cried Mme . Bonacieux , throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands . "" My Lord ! "" cried d ' Artagnan , enlightened by a sudden idea , "" my Lord ! Pardon me , monsieur , but you are not -- "" "" My Lord the Duke of Buckingham , "" said Mme . Bonacieux , in an undertone ; "" and now you may ruin us all . "" "" My Lord , Madame , I ask a hundred pardons ! But I love her , my Lord , and was jealous . You know what it is to love , my Lord . Pardon me , and then tell me how I can risk my life to serve your Grace ? "" "" You are a brave young man , "" said Buckingham , holding out his hand to d ' Artagnan , who pressed it respectfully . "" You offer me your services ; with the same frankness I accept them . Follow us at a distance of twenty paces , as far as the Louvre , and if anyone watches us , slay him ! "" D ' Artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm , allowed the duke and Mme . Bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead , and then followed them , ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of Charles I. Fortunately , he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion , and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any interference . As for d ' Artagnan , he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the Pomme-de-Pin , where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting him . Without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them , he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance . Meanwhile , carried away as we are by our narrative , we must leave our three friends to themselves , and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the Louvre ."

1629	"The Winchester Mystery House was the estate of Sarah Winchester , widow of gun magnate William Winchester . Legend has it that Mrs. Winchester believed the home was haunted by people killed by Winchester rifles , and only constant construction and remodeling of the mansion would appease the ghosts . Nightly sÃ©ances informed her building plans , and construction financed by the Winchester rifle fortune continued day and night from 1884 until her death in 1922 , resulting in a 160 room mansion . The current owners of the mansion registered the "" Winchester Mystery House "" word mark and a logo with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , and have extensively marketed the tourist attraction locally and internationally . In 2008 , the owners entered into an exclusive movie agreement with a production company for use of the house as a location , and for use of certain trademarks and copyrights in promotional materials . The following year , the Defendant , another production company , inquired with Plaintiff about rates for using the house for a low budget haunted house / ghost story movie . Plaintiff declined to give Defendant location rates and mentioned that it had signed a contract with "" another company for the exclusive rights to the Winchester story , "" but they failed to give additional details . Defendant went ahead and filmed its movie , using Plaintiff's word mark in the film's title , "" Haunting of Winchester House . "" The film was loosely based on the story of Sarah Winchester , with additional fictional elements , and the DVD cover featured a shot of a different Victorian-style house . Defendant publicized production of the film on its website in July 2009 , and Plaintiff immediately sent Defendant a cease and desist letter alleging trademark infringement , which led to this lawsuit . Plaintiff's suit alleged , in part , trademark infringement and unfair competition under the Lanham Act . At issue was whether Defendant's First Amendment rights protected its artistic expression and trumped Plaintiff's trademark infringement and unfair competition claims . The California court looked to the Second Circuit's Rogers test , as adopted by the Ninth Circuit , to determine the degree to which First Amendment rights narrowed the scope of Lanham Act trademark rights in the context of movie titles , recognizing that titles of films serve both a commercial and artistic function . The Ninth Circuit has held that , when a mark has assumed such a high level of cultural or historical significance that it has become a part of the public's vocabulary , a trademark owner does not have the right to control public discourse using the mark . Ultimately the appellate court agreed with Defendant and held that the First Amendment provided an absolute defense on the trademark infringement and unfair competition claims . The Winchester Mystery House had gained such historical and cultural significance that the use of Plaintiffs word mark in Defendant's movie title was protected expression , even if it was unauthorized ."

1490	"Long before "" sustainable "" and "" environmentally friendly "" became public statements , the professionals already knew all about the energy-saving possibilities of a well designed home . Unfortunately , they were often forced to conform to "" houses must face the street "" , rooms had to conform to what worked in the past rather than what was best for local conditions . Because of this many structures are not in line with today's standards of sustainability . Across Australia , and in some other countries in the world , new houses and renos are required by law to provide minimum standards of energy efficiency . While these laws vary from state to state , country to country , all require a 4-star or 5-star energy efficiency rating . The homebuyer then has to decide on whether to pay out the extra cash at construction , or have regular and continuing savings in the future . The critical component in sustainable design is the building's orientation on the land . Not only the direction the house faces but particularly way the windows are facing . In small buildings ( houses ) orientation allows the proper control of summer and winter heat loads which penetrate through a building's outer shell . Research needs to be done on movement of sun , slope of land , prevailing breezes , existing trees and vegetation and any other special characteristics in each individual state / territory . Different climate zones within the area must also be taken into consideration . Strategies for the tropics are different to those in temperate or alpine areas . In the southern hemisphere , ideally the longest axis for the home should run east to west , with living areas facing north . North-facing rooms accumulate winter warmth , but can also be shaded during the summer heat as the sun is higher in the sky . The southern side is coolest and is best for bedrooms . The western side will get hot in the afternoons and is probably the best side for laundry , bathroom , garage or storage areas . The east will catch the morning sun which is good for breakfast room or kitchen . Of course any special characteristics , such as a beautiful view which is facing the west in summer would want to be seen year round , not only from the garage or storeroom . Under these circumstances it is important to plan with careful attention shading and type of glass used . Use natural cooling rather than air conditioning to further protect our environment and save on energy costs . Of course if your home is not in the "" perfect "" position and you are considering renovations , always plan for easing the problem . This could simply be adding insulation , shading windows or walls , swapping rooms around , or planting trees and shrubs . Author is Brendan Hogg .

1632	"The Energy Blog Alex Brodsky 06-22-2012 The Health Benefit of Hot Tubs for Kids When we think about Hot Tub benefits , we usually think of adults with back pain taking a long soak after another long day at work . We do n't really think of a Hot Tub as a healthy outlet for children , other than a place to have fun like a splash pool . My perception changed when my fiancÃ© , who is a speech therapist , told me that high temperatures generated by a Hot Tub , can be beneficial for kids with autism . I decided to delve further into the health benefits of Hot Tubs for children , and found this information on a blog from Alice Cunningham , Owner of Olympic Hot Tubs in Washington State . "" Physical therapist Kristin Cooley of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta , which treats about 50 children a month with water therapy , says parents often can help with the therapy at home under a professional's guidance . Cooley identifies benefits for these conditions : * Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis and Hot Tub Therapy . The water's buoyancy helps support a broader range of motion for children with joint inflammation and muscle weakness while the water's resistance helps strengthen muscles . Jet turbulence in the tub can teach better balance , and kids can boost their endurance with aerobic exercises in the water . Take it easy during a flare-up , but otherwise encourage more activity during the session . * Cystic Fibrosis and Asthma and Hot Tub Therapy . The pressure of the water on the chests helps strengthen the diaphragm , leading to more lung capacity , breath control , and rib mobility . Because chemicals are evaporating from the water within 18 inches of the surface , children with these problems should spend only about10 minutes with their face that close , and maybe another 10 minutes waist-deep . * Cerebral Palsy and Hot Tub Therapy . The water's support helps children stand , walk and keep better balance . The jets and warm water loosen muscles and ease pain . * Brittle Bones and Hot Tub Therapy . Children whose bones break easily because of osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) can exercise more safely in the water . The sessions strengthen their muscles and improve mobility and motor skills . * Scoliosis and Hot Tub Therapy . Buoyancy and resistance in the water strengthen muscles on the weak side of the curved spine and even help improve the body's alignment . * Autism & Sensory Integration Dysfunction and Hot Tub Therapy . The physical sensation of water on the body helps calm children who have autism .

1487	"Drama â Dramatic activities such as skits , recitations , puppet shows and simple storytelling can let a child concentrate on being a different character for a short time . Put a costume on them and watch how quickly they start getting into character . However , it may take direction from you to keep them focused and enjoying the event . Costumes need not be elaborate to let a child be another character . It need only be representational . A single feather in a headband , a necktie , a hat , sunglasses , scrubs or even just a sign or patch fastened to clothing is enough to let a child jump into another role . Let the child use his or her imagination to help find costume pieces as part of the dramatic play process . And do n't restrict them to the costume box . Colanders make great space helmets . When Sid's children were growing up , they had a "" costume closet "" with an assortment of coats , brightly colored shirts , hats and accessories such as scarves , belts , wigs and , of course , masks . If an article of clothing became outdated , before disposing of it , they 'd consider its costume potential . Putting together a costume for Halloween was always a big event . On top of that , living in New Orleans offered them Mardi Gras as a second costuming event each year . Playhouses and play tents â Giving a child a space of his or her own is a great way to encourage imaginative pretend play . Whether it 's stretching a sheet over dining room chairs to make a house or a purchased indoor or outdoor playhouse or play tent with a theme , a child is free to role-play and make up scenarios that could happen in the space . At The Creativity Institute , we carry several types of playhouses , play tents and tunnels in themes that include a teepee , theater tent , castle and military camouflage . We also carry puppet theaters that can double as play stores and other types of play spaces . Our big foam blocks are large enough to construct make-believe buildings and tunnels a child can climb over and under . We also have play panels that can be moved around to create an ever-changing mix of play environments . This type of pretend play is also conducive to playing with others , offering an opportunity for a child to develop those all-important socialization skills . Puppet shows â Puppets allow a child to act out many different roles and have fun with character voices . There are many sources for skits that can be adapted to the puppet stage and even ready-to-perform scripts in your library and on the Web . At The Creativity Institute , we have a section devoted to puppetry with puppets and puppet theaters . You 'll find links to script resources on the Internet , puppeteer tips and even a free sample scripts we adapted for the puppet stage . To make it easier to get started , we 've bundled together puppets and puppet theater packages and even grouped puppet casts with accompanying scripts , ready to perform . There 's an Aesop's Fables Puppet Starter Set with five puppets and four fables adapted to the puppet stage . There 's also an Old MacDonald Puppet Starter Set with Farmer MacDonald and seven barnyard animal puppets and an accompanying script of the song . Again , your direction will be invaluable in providing enough structure for the event that will let the children have a greater sense of accomplishment and stay interested longer . And because puppets offer a degree of separation from real issues , they can offer lots of opportunities for learning about inappropriate behaviors . For example , if a child with ADHD has been overly aggressive with other children , acting out the consequences with animal puppets can offer a more painless and effective lesson . Record it â Getting the performances down on tape gives everyone more opportunities to laugh and enjoy it all over again . There 's a difference between taping the children playing at creating the performance and "" making a movie "" of the show , and both are wonderful to watch again and again . Taping the children at play shows their performance , as well as the behind-the-scenes preparation . Making a movie is just a matter of trying to capture what the audience would see . All you have to do is prepare the children for the scene and start and stop the camera at the right times â and move on . You can even start with a title card the children can make for the show â using their own artistic skills . If the child acts out while taping is underway , continue shooting , but keep your reprimands to a minimum . Put your energy into trying to refocus the child's attention toward continuing the performance or easing into a hastier conclusion . Later , when viewing the tape , the child may be able to see problem behaviors more clearly , rather than focusing more on your anger . Dollhouses and activity sets â Playing with dolls and action figures is another valuable opportunity for pretend play . Dollhouses , toy pirate ships , castles , firehouses , farms and other traditional activity sets have the magic to let children get lost in their imaginations . Even the more popular activity sets based on movies and TV shows allow the same opportunities . And do n't forget what imaginations can do with boxes , blocks and anything that can become the setting for a creative play session . Blocks â Toys for children with ADHD should be simple and encourage the use of their imaginations , and one of the most basic of toys is building blocks . Block play can be great for many ages . From simple stack-up and knock-over fun to imaginative building . Blocks teach problem-solving skills , because a child discovers how stacking and matching can produce different results . They can also become components of pretend play , because a child can fantasize what the structures are . There are also big foam blocks that are almost "" life size "" and let children create their own fantasy playhouses . These lightweight blocks are so versatile , they can be climbed on or tunneled under . Magnetic block and construction sets have pieces that connect in more ways than can conventional plastic snap-together blocks and allow even more imaginative opportunities . We also carry a selection of traditional and colorful wooden blocks that are full of fantasy building opportunities . Blocks , like many traditional toys , have other educational advantages for a child with ADHD . The number of positive outcomes is limitless , so children can continue playing until they 've reached a level of personal satisfaction . Whether the child is building with traditional blocks or shoeboxes , try to show interest in every structure . Encourage the child to name creations , even if it 's simply Wobbly Land or Crazy Tower . Showing interest without criticism offers your child valuable , long-lasting affirmation . Art Activities â Any medium such as crayons , markers , chalk , paint and clay can give a child a wealth of expressive opportunities . Sometimes you may want to suggest a subject idea to get them started . Art supplies are some of the least expensive educational toys you can provide . Gwynn used to bring home old stationery and unused printed samples to give her children a virtually unlimited supply of art paper . She 'd also purchase low-end copy paper , offering the kids free rein on a giant stack of blank paper . And here 's something you can try on a big scale . Sid used to get leftover paper billboards from the local outdoor company and tack them on his backyard fence , backside out , to give the children blank giant-size panels for murals . The change in scale of their artist's canvas gets them thinking of possibilities in a different perspective and keeps them intrigued for hours . Another way to give structure to art activities is with their own easel . We carry a selection of folding , double-sided and adjustable easels that provide a convenient supply of paper and drawing surfaces in a self-contained , accessible environment . One rule of thumb to follow to help inspire your kids to express themselves is to encourage all efforts . Today's crooked stick figure could lead to tomorrow's Picasso . Most important , artistic expression is highly therapeutic to your child , even if it does n't happen to please your eye . Books â There are many books that can hold a child's attention . The public library is a great start and your librarian can help you . Garage sales and community book fairs are a great way to build a library of your own . Collections of rhymes , poems or short stories are a good way to start with a child who is easily distracted . The Oppenheim Toy Portfolio listed the top toys for children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and included , among other things , a magnetic construction set , a tree-house-theme dollhouse play set , a decorate-it-yourself birdfeeder , board games and a simple , basic rubber ball . Oppenheim also suggested the toy general categories of dramatic play and artistic activities . * The National Institute of Mental Health recommends that if ADHD is suspected , the diagnosis should be made by a professional with training in ADHD . This includes child psychiatrists , psychologists , developmental / behavioral pediatricians , behavioral neurologists and clinical social workers . After ruling out other possible reasons for the child's behavior , the specialist checks the child's school and medical records and talks to teachers and parents who have filled out a behavior rating scale for the child . A diagnosis is made only after all this information has been considered ."	Instruction
357	"More information on a DIY CO2 set-up What about plant fertiler ? Try the PMDD article Question - Why do most of my plants die in around a months time ? Why do I have to keep buying some more ?!! Is it plastic fantastic for the rest of my life ? Hey , calm down , you can keep some of your plants alive even though your aquarium is low-tech . Yeah , certainly some can fail , and make no mistake , plenty of mine have . I 'm not saying that unless you have a degree in botany you will be successful , but it 's a whole lot helpful if you have some knowledge about aquatic plants . Plants need these basic few things : A good substrate ( Substrate ? You what ? ) : To start off with , you 've gone and bought some nice , coarse , gravel - no wonder your plants have problems rooting . A good substrate is really needed , and 2-3 mm , low-calcium beach gravel available from your aquatic shop will be a good start . Using this sort of substrate , allows the roots to penetrate easily , and anchors the plant - a big no-no to coarse gravel , as the plants will just give up and go home . Well , they 'll die to be precise . Other types of substrate are : Laterite : Iron-rich clays , in a reddish colour , you can buy some in your local pet shop . Why bother ? You do n't have to , but this will add some iron into the substrate . You can get it in a pellet form , where you just mix it with your normal gravel , and then add a 100 % gravel top layer . The roots can go directly into the substrate . By doing this , you do n't have to use so much fertiliser in the water column , minimise the risk of algae breakouts . And does n ' t everyone just love an algae breakout ? Sand : Using sand as a 100 % substrate can be detrimental to the plants , as it can compact quite tightly , and therefore roots can rot away in dead patches . Nutrients : A good mixture is needed if the plants are to thrive . Iron is one of the important elements , for the green pigment of plants ( chlorophyll ) . Other elements include : Manganese , Zinc , Magnesium , Copper , Boron , Potassium , Sulfur , Phosphorous , Calcium , Nitrogen . No mean list there - You may thinking , "" what am I meant to do ? Go and buy a bloody laboratory to check the amount of nutrients in my water !! "" No , its not realistic is it . Many of those nutrients will be free in your tap water , and you can buy a liquid fertiliser , or 2 , to make sure you are adding enough . Plants will also use the Nitrates in your aquarium , which is no bad thing at all . You have got to try to balance the fertiliser with the plants , and it 's a bit of a tricky old situation . If you go and drown your aquarium with fertiliser , algae can come a ' calling . For instance , Iron content does n ' t need to be anymore than 1ppm . Now what about Photosynthesis - light / CO2 ? Do I need it in a aquarium ? Of course you do !! Every plant needs this little bit of magic . And how much CO2 will be needed then ? And light ? Now its 's getting a bit trickier , you start delving into the more advanced side of the hobby . The fish in your aquarium will give off CO2 ( respiration ) , but it wo n ' t be that much . If you are really going for a heavily planted tank with some tough plants , You could add some CO2 , and place some extra bulbs in your tank . And how much CO2 would be needed for the average plant ? 15 - 30 ppm wo n ' t go too far off . A bit different from iron 1ppm hey !! And you could use a CO2 injection system . No , n o , do n't all run away , if you know what you are doing , you wont kill all of your fish in one fell swoop . I 'm not going to try explaining everything on this page , as this can be quite complex . One thing is certain - do n't go out and buy 100 lamps if you have no CO2 system , as Photosynthesis will only occur if there is a balance between light / CO2 . Water conditions : Is every plant a hardy one ? Unfortunately , no . Some need quite specific conditions - say , the "" Isoetes Setacea "" , needs these properties for it to thrive : KH : 2-5 , pH : 5 . 5-6 , and needs a lot of bright light . Now if I had a tank with the specs , let us say - about 8KH ; pH 7.5 , and one bulb , theres not much chance of me keeping this plant alive for a very long time , no matter how much fertiliser , or good substrate I have . Although plants will use Nitrates as a source of food , and your tank has levels of 20-30ppm or over , some plants can be affected badly . Only 20-30ppm ? That 's not right surely ? I hear what you say , but if you look around for pics for heavily planted tanks , often there will be a smaller population of fish compared to the normal stocking level . Here 's some info on some tough , low light plants , that anyone should be able to keep alive : Java Fern ( Microsorium pteropus ) : PH : 5.5 - 7.5 Temp : 20 - 25C KH : 2 - 12 Java Fern is very popular , you 'll probably have bought some of this already . In the natural enviroment , it creeps over logs and rockwork , attaching itself by roots . Its often used to decorate bogword , where the Rhizomes can be secured by wire or a nylon thread , until they become firmly attached . It can grow in subdued light Hygrophillia polsperma : Substrate : Plain washed gravel PH : 6.5 - 7.8 Temp : 15 - 30C KH : 2 - 15 Specs look good eh ? And it 's a very attractive plant as well . It grows rapidly in a range of water conditions , perfect to start off your aquarium with . It would like quite a bit of bright light , but you can get by with 1.5 Watts per Gallon . When it actually hits the surface of the water , it will start to run horizontally , and runners will pop out . You could cut the tops and re-plant it , it helps to rejuvinate it . Vallisneria spiralis : Substrate : Plain washed gravel PH : 6.5 - 7.5 Temp : 15 - 30C KH : 5 - 12 This is a linear , grasslike plant , perfect for a backgroud aquarium . They can grow quite rapidly , and could reach up to 60cm . Its another plant that would do well in bright light , but will tolerant light shade . It can be quite indifferent to water quality in your aquarium - buy it !!"	Instruction

1667	"God Sends Sunday was the last book of the Harlem Renaissance . It was published in 1931 by one of New York's major publishers . It appeared in bookstores more than a decade after the start of the concentrated upsurge in artistic creation by African Americans , centered in Harlem , that came to be known as the Harlem Renaissance . The book's author was a relative latecomer to Harlem : Arna Bontemps moved there in 1924 , after graduating from college in California . He began teaching at the Harlem Academy , and he put himself into the middle of Harlem's artistic tumult through friendships with other writers and a string of prizes that he won for his poetry in 1926 and 1927 . But the stock market collapsed in late 1929 , and the economic disorder that evolved into the Great Depression began to spread . Bontemps continued teaching while he was writing what would become God Sends Sunday . Harcourt , Brace agreed to publish the book in 1931 , and it received generally positive reviews . Yet larger forces buffeted Bontemps and those around him . As he wrote , drily , in 1968 : Within weeks after the publication of my first book , as it happened , I had been caught up in a quaint and poignant disorder that failed to attract wide attention . It was one of the side effects of the crash that brought on the Depression , and it brought instant havoc to the Harlem Renaissance of the twenties . I was one of the hopeful young people displaced , so to speak . The jobs we had counted on to keep us alive and writing in New York vanished , as some observed , quicker than a cat could wink . Bontemps's job at the Harlem Academy ended in 1931 ; he and his family moved to Alabama , where he taught at a small college and continued writing and also meeting and corresponding with those he had met in Harlem . He would eventually end up in Chicago , and then at Fisk University in Nashville , and become one of the most important chroniclers of the Harlem Renaissance and of African American literary culture . God Sends Sunday was not the last book of the Harlem Renaissance solely because it was published at a time when economic and social forces were dispersing Harlem's concentration of writers and artists . Bontemps's novel also showed some of the dissatisfaction that younger black writers felt toward what they saw as older writers' attempts to conform to white middle-class expectations about respectability and success . God Sends Sunday is a novel about a jockey in St. Louis ; it deals in violence and sex and sports and drinking and failure among African Americans , and its rendering of that world , and particularly its speech , is lyrical and vivid . W.E.B. Du Bois was among those who did not give the novel a positive review ; he criticized its lack of uplift and labeled it "" a profound disappointment . "" But it was this sort of perspective that Bontemps was pushing back against . So too , Bontemps based the novel's main character , Little Augie , on his Uncle Buddy â on a real life , in other words , lived by a real , complicated man . Richard Wright would most ferociously express this resistance to a Du Bois-like perspective in the late 1930s and '40s , and his work , among others ' , would represent a decisive break from that of the Harlem Renaissance . Bontemps himself would continue to push in a similar direction with his next novel , Black Thunder , published in 1936 , about a failed slave revolt in Virginia . It would become a more popular book than God Sends Sunday . But God Sends Sunday remains , as the last book of one of the most extraordinary eras of creativity in American history , a more significant milestone ."	Information/Explanation

( outside diameter ) copper tubing . Be sure both ends of copper tubing are cut square . 5 . Using a grounded drill , drill a 1 â 4 "" ( 6 . 35 mm ) hole in the cold water pipe you have selected . Use copper tubing and check for leaks . Install copper tubing only in areas where the household temperatures will remain above freezing . Water Pressure A cold water supply with water pressure of between 30 and 120 psi ( 207 - 827 kPa ) is required to operate the water dispenser and ice maker . If you have questions about your water pressure , call a licensed , qualified plumber . Reverse Osmosis Water Supply IMPORTANT : The pressure of the water supply coming out of a reverse osmosis system going to the water inlet valve of the refrigerator needs to be between 30 and 120 psi ( 207 - 827 kPa ) . If a reverse osmosis water filtration system is connected to your cold water supply , the water pressure to the reverse osmosis system needs to be a minimum of 40 to 60 psi ( 276 - 414 kPa ) . If the water pressure to the reverse osmosis system is less than 40 to 60 psi ( 276 - 414 kPa ) : osmosis system is blocked . Replace the filter if necessary . Allow the storage tank on the reverse osmosis system to refill after heavy usage . If your refrigerator has a water filter , it may further reduce the water pressure when used in conjunction with a reverse osmosis system . Remove the water filter . See "" Water Filtration System . "" If you have questions about your water pressure , call a licensed , qualified plumber . Connect Water Supply Connect to Refrigerator 1 . Unplug refrigerator or disconnect power . 2 . Attach the copper tube to the valve inlet using a compression nut and sleeve as shown . Tighten the compression nut . Do not overtighten . 3 .

381	"Deep in the Bowels of Beit Basement ( June 1998 - October 1999 ) [ Photo Gallery ] In mid-1998 , a Union Sabbatical , who was also a member of Jazz and Rock society , happened to mention that they had a old room in the Beit basement that was n ' t in use . The committee of the time proceeded to make a nuisance of themselves until the society was given permission to take over this much larger room for the library . The room was a mess - cigarette ash several inches deep , the walls covered in eggboxes ( sound proofing ) , and some wooden construction in the middle of the room . After much effort ( and the smashing of a light fitting ) , the place was cleaned out and made ready for painting . The room became white with a dark blue network of piping . Two giant metal struts , studded with bolts , were carefully painted to resemble Daleks . It was a strangely industrial room , with large apparently random concrete blocks ( which made for good seating but inconvenienced shelf layout ) , an abundant selection of different pipes , complete with taps and broken-off ends , and one particularly large and complex ' feature ' ( a sewage output ? ) that was a real pain to paint . A large dragon mural ( "" Flarebright "" ) covered one stretch of wall , designed by karne , and painted by karne , Viv , and Liz . The door was covered with blackboard paint , so that ' useful ' messages could , theoretically , be written on it in chalk . A large sign declaring something about parking was obtained , and the back also painted with blackboard paint , and ICSF in large white letters . This started off on the door , but eventually made its way to in front of the TV . For this brief time when the society had possession of two rooms , people would occasionally adjourn to the new one to take advantage of the floor space to play Tragic . The room was only 10m or so away from the old library - down a tunnel on the left of the old library , which led under the Quad , past store rooms of Outdoor Club , Canoe , ?? , and opposite a room belonging to "" Tools for Self Reliance "" or various others . Karne notes : "" ownership varied wildly - mainly various charity groups and 3 world help people - I 'm convinced they kept stealing our paint .. "" It was at the end of the accessible corridor , approximately under the Beit Archway . Extract from Wyrmtongue , Oct. 1998 To find it , go to the Union Building , as you enter Beit Quad ( just after the archway ) you should turn left and continue walking until you reach some railings . On your right , is an iron staircase heading downwards . The library is actually in the basement , so go down the stairs and continue until you reach the white door , turn left and go through the brown door . You 'll find yourself in a twisty tunnel , turn right , then left and walk to the end of the corridor . The library is on your right and has a black-door covered in chalk . The tunnel continued , but was blocked by a locked door beyond which was a forbidden zone . However , sometimes this door was unlocked for mysterious reasons , and it was discovered that the tunnel continued down some rickety old wooden steps and right across the Quad , to join up to the NE corner of Beit . The tunnel had a similar unfinished , industrial feel to the room - numerous coloured wires and pipes showing in the ceiling and walls , loose planks with large gaps between them forming the floor , through which miscellaneous small items were occasionally lost . People were known to pull up these planks to retrieve dropped possessions , revealing a 1 . 5m deep grimy hole with yet more pipes . A blinking amber road light sat cheerily outside the new icsf library door , which was fortunate , as the corridor light seemed to break / become ' lost ' with surprising regularity . Being so close to the old library , the books were transferred by hand by a convoy of icsf committee and proto-committee . The shelves were bolted to the walls with power tools ( thanks to Alan ! ) . Several sets of cheap black metal shelves were bought - these turned out not to be such a good investment , as they tended to buckle under the weight of the books . It was resolved to buy the more expensive grey British Standard shelves next time . This new room served the society with distinction . It was huge , with ample room for all the shelves as well as a large area for sitting and watching TV . The stifling heat led to the purchase of a fan for the library ; a bin was also acquired to control the spread of Union curry . The room became almost respectable over the course of the next year , with the acquisition ( thanks to certain members of the society and monitoring of the , ahem , abandoned goods in Beit Quad ) of a wooden coffee table ( often used for Tragic ) , a really really nasty orange-brown sofa ( later binned on health & safety grounds by the Union ) , 5 good quality reception chairs , another swivel chair , a dusty green carpet , and even a fridge ( belonging to Adam , who did n't have room for it in his flat ) . The wooden stool and increasingly dead black swivel chair were also transferred to the new library , along with ( of course ) First and Second Stage , the video cabinets , and the nasty cushions . A large piece of mattress foam , minus any sort of covering , was also obtained and placed on one of the aforementioned concrete blocks as convenient seating for people watching the TV , or wanting somewhere to collapse . This piece of yellow foam was never covered , resulting in small pieces continually breaking off and being distributed around the floor and on people's clothing . ( Karne mutters something about Robin , a party , and a large amount of port , related in some way to a stain on the underside of the yellow foam . I do n't want to know . ) The walls were again covered with posters . Two large plastic ' trays ' of spare books were piled in the corner - these were duplicates of books already in the library , acquired from various donations . The library did n't want to keep these ( no room ! ) , but sold them to members at a minimal cost . Being in the same basement , this room suffered the same wildlife problems as the previous one , but for some reason it was less noticeable ( probably more chairs for them to hide under ) . However , Outdoor Club members were known to employ a hammer when entering their stores ( in the same corridor ) , in an attempt to take the cockroaches unawares . This library saw a lot of use during its year . It was frequently open outside official opening hours , turning into a common room for the members , who would turn up whenever they were in college without a lecture to go to . There were regularly 6-15 people in the library at lunchtimes , and much Babylon 5 was watched ( Robin having temporarily loaned his collection to the library ) . Unfortunately , this library also seemed to suffer more than its fair share of security problems in its short existence , possibly aided by the number of people going in and out . Certain valuable items were lost , as well as multiple left-over buckets of paint , and the entire Amber series by Zelazny . At one point the lock was forced , but ( thanks to Alan again ) it was replaced with a new one , plus much chemical metal , which solved that problem . In this year , the library was honoured by the temporary presence of the RCSU mascot , Theta . Several Theta bearers were active icsf members , and for a few weeks between public appearances , Theta ( a large and heavy thermometer ) resided among the shelves . Many of the pictures on this page were taken from a Half-Life map that was made - for more and larger pictures , see Mapping and Modelling - icsf Library .

1367	"The Coalition is comprised primarily of , but not limited to , prepaid and pre-subscribed international long distance service providers . These providers voluntarily and anonymously joined forces in an effort to remedy certain discriminatory and inequitable issues associated with the Universal Service Administrative Corporation's ( "" USAC "" ) administration of the FCC's Universal Service Fund ( "" USF "" ) contribution requirements . The Petition requests Commission action on two issues affecting International Telecommunications Companies ( "" ITCs "" ) . First , the Coalition proposed a solution to discriminatory pass-through charges imposed upon "" de minimis "" resale carriers . The USF is a federal program created to assist in national diffusion of telecommunications services . Unless exempted , all telecommunications carriers must contribute a portion of their interstate and international end-user revenues to the USF . Currently , the FCC's rules exempt "" de minimis "" providers , those whose contribution to universal service does not exceed $ 10 , 000 per year , from direct USF fees . However , because the FCC treats these non-contributors as end-users , and allows underlying carriers to pass USF fees through to their end-user customers , de minimis carriers ultimately bear a significant USF burden . In fact , a provider's pass-through burden under the current system often exceeds the burden it would otherwise face as a direct contributor . The FCC also limits the burden on carriers whose interstate revenues amount to less than 12 % of their combined international and interstate end-user revenues . However , a qualifying international carrier that is also a de minimis provider is especially at risk for high pass-through fees . While the FCC only requires direct payment on the interstate portion of a qualifying carrier's revenue , the underlying carrier can pass through fees on its entire revenue base . The Coalition urged the adoption of a rule allowing carriers to elect either to pay indirect pass-through charges or to contribute directly . Second , the petition sought reclassification of resale Prepaid Calling Card ( "" PPCC "" ) revenue as non-end-user revenue . At present , the FCC treats all PPCC revenue as end-user revenue , the effect of which is to substantially increase resale providers' USF liability . Finally , the petition requested abolition of the current rule requiring PPCC providers to report as USF-eligible revenues they never collect . This reporting method results in the imposition of higher USF rates on PPCC providers than upon other carriers . To solve the problem , the Coalition suggested allowing PPCC providers to deduct uncollected revenues from their USF-eligible revenues or to report only those revenues actually received . In addition to the instant Petition , the Coalition is currently considering filing additional petitions to seek review of a variety of other USF administration issues that are particularly burdensome and which unfairly impact International Telecommunications Companies .

I should be grateful if you would arrange for this letter and its annex to be circulated as a document of the General Assembly , under the item "" Measures to eliminate international terrorism "" , and of the Security Council . Accept , Sir , the assurances of my highest consideration . ( Signed ) Bruno RodrÃ­guez Parrilla Ambassador Permanent Representative Annex to the letter dated 29 October 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General Summary of principal terrorist actions against Cuba ( 1990-2000 ) Since 1959 , counter-revolutionary groups established and run by the United States Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) have committed a number of terrorist acts , which have cost our country valuable lives and vast resources . In the early 1990s , encouraged by the collapse of the socialist camp , these groups acting from United States territory and other bases of operations in Central America intensified their violent actions against the people of Cuba and their leaders . Details are given below of some of the most important of these , about which information has been made public : 17 July 1990 . After lobbying by the Florida Republican Congresswomen Ileana Ros and Connie Mack , the President of the United States , George Bush , released the known terrorist Orlando Bosch , who master-minded the attack which destroyed a Cuban civilian aircraft in mid-flight in October 1976 , killing all 73 persons on board . 14 October 1990 . Armed infiltration via Santa Cruz del Norte organized from Miami of two terrorists with orders to commit acts of violence . Their weapons and forged documents issued in Miami were confiscated .

One of the occupants of the launch stated that he planned to assassinate Fidel Castro when the President arrived at Isla Margarita , Venezuela , to attend the Ibero-American Summit on 7 November 1997 . The United States authorities found that the launch was registered to a Florida company . The chief executive officer , director , secretary and treasurer of that company was JosÃ© Antonio Llama , a CANF official and one of the mercenaries who took part in the Bay of Pigs invasion . One of the rifles was registered in the name of JosÃ© Francisco "" Pepe "" HernÃ¡ndez , president of CANF . The other had been bought in 1994 by a member of Brigade 2506 . The four crew members of the launch were identified as : a known CIA agent ; the captain of a CIA boat used by teams infiltrating into Cuba from Florida ; the chairman of a New Jersey counter-revolutionary group and a member of Alpha 66 . Despite their own confessions and clear proof of illegal possession of weapons , false testimony and weapons smuggling , these terrorists were acquitted by a Federal Court in December 1999 , after a rigged trial . 30 October 1997 . An explosive device was discovered in a service kiosk outside terminal 2 at Havana's JosÃ© MartÃ­ airport . Two citizens of Salvadoran origin and three Guatemalans with ties to the terrorist Luis Posada Carriles were later arrested and charged with criminal activities against tourist facilities . 16 November 1997 . Following an investigation that lasted two months , a Florida newspaper reported that the bomb attacks in Havana had been directed and financed by anti-Cuban groups based in Miami and that Luis Posada Carriles , a fugitive from justice for having blown up the Cuban aircraft in 1976 , was the man pulling the strings . May 1998 . Infiltration by two terrorists who came from the United States and entered Cuba through Santa LucÃ­a , Pinar del RÃ­o , with numerous weapons and munitions . 16 June 1998 . Following various exchanges in which the Government of Cuba gave the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and other agencies of the United States Government information on terrorist activities in the United States against Cuba , an official delegation that included two senior FBI officials came to Havana and was provided with specific information , including films , tapes and other material evidence on the activities of 40 terrorists operating from United States territory . 12 July 1998 . The New York Times of that date reported statements by the Cuban-American Antonio Jorge Ãlvarez that the FBI had not investigated his reports of a planned attack against President Fidel Castro to be carried out at the Ibero-American Summit in Venezuela . Ãlvarez said that he had provided information the preceding year to the effect that Posada Carriles and a group that worked in his factory in Guatemala were planning such an attack and the bombings in Havana : "" I risked my life and my business , and they did nothing "" . 12 and 13 July 1998 . In an interview with The New York Times , Luis Posada Carriles admitted that he had organized the bombing campaign against tourist sites in Cuba , that the leaders of the Cuban American National Foundation had financed his operations and that Jorge Mas Canosa , the Foundation's President , had personally overseen the flow of money and logistical support : "" Jorge controlled everything . Whenever I needed money , he said to give me $ 5 , 000 , give me $ 10 , 000 , give me $ 15 , 000 , and they sent it to me "" . Posada also admitted that he had paid RaÃºl Cruz LeÃ³n to plant the bombs in Havana hotels . Referring to the Italian tourist killed by one of them , he told the Times : "" That Italian was sitting in the wrong place at the wrong time "" . To prepare these articles , the Times used Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and FBI files , testimony from more than 100 people and more than 13 hours of taped interviews with Posada , and even documents which he himself had signed . 23 July 1998 . The Miami press published an article entitled "" Anti-Castro plots seldom lead to jail in U. S. "" . The article cited a number of cases , such as the 1990 acquittal of six terrorists who had shipped a cannon and other weapons to Nicaragua to attack the Cuban President , and the 1994 cases of Rodolfo FrÃ³meta and Fausto MarimÃ³n , who were charged with planning to use Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and other weapons for terrorist activities . The article also included statements by the well-known terrorist Tony Bryant to the effect that , in 1989 , the FBI had stopped him with a shipment of weapons and explosives in a boat , but had let him go . He added that two of his 14 missions against Cuba had been intercepted but that nothing had ever happened to him . 2 August 1998 . Posada Carriles , in an interview for the programme Polos Opuestos on the television channel CBS Telenoticias , said that he intended to perpetrate further attacks against Cuban installations within or outside the island . August 1998 . Following the announcement that President Fidel Castro would attend the Caribbean Forum summit meeting in the Dominican Republic , terrorist elements of Cuban origin planned to carry out an attack between 20 and 25 August . To that end , the terrorist Posada Carriles held a meeting at the Holiday Inn hotel in Guatemala City one month beforehand to plan how to bring weapons and explosives to Santo Domingo . 12 September 1998 . Authorities in Miami arrested the five Cuban patriots who had done their duty to defend Cubans and Americans against the terrorist acts organized , prepared and launched against Cuba , with total impunity , from United States territory . 17 November 2000 . Panamanian authorities arrested a group of terrorists headed by Posada Carriles , who had entered Panama with false documents to carry out an attack against President Fidel Castro during the tenth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government . Weapons , explosives and sketches of the Cuban President's route and scheduled public appearances were seized . The Cuban American National Foundation financed the team of lawyers hired to defend the terrorists . 26 April 2001 . Three terrorists belonging to the F-45 and Alpha 66 commando groups tried to enter Cuba from the north of Villa Clara province and were captured after they shot at Cuban border guards who detected them . Authorities seized four AKM rifles , one M-3 gun with a silencer , three handguns , a large supply of ammunition , night-vision weapon sights and means of communication , which were to be used to carry out acts of sabotage and terrorism in Cuba . In addition to the above-mentioned acts , the Cuban authorities have learned of 16 planned attacks against the President of Cuba , eight planned attacks against other leaders of the Revolution and 140 other terrorist plans between 1990 and 2001 , which were thwarted , discouraged or blocked by the work of Cuba's security and intelligence agencies ."

1326	"raditionally , biology research begins with a hypothesis . A biologist then collects experimental data and analyzes them to support or disprove the hypothesis . However , information technology is changing this sequence of events . Today , large-scale exploratory experiments are gathering as much data as possible ; for example , the Human Genome Project is enumerating the three billion amino acids in the human genetic blueprint . So now when a biologist forms a hypothesis , the data may already be in such a collection , just a computer search away . An NPACI alpha project led by Russ Altman of Stanford University is developing new tools and techniques to extract insights from growing biology data collections . Alongside these collections , a new discipline has emerged , called bioinformatics . Bioinformatics researchers develop and apply computing tools to extract the secrets of the life and death of organisms from the genetic blueprints and molecular structures stored in digital collections . However , while large-scale activities are amassing vast quantities of data , the techniques for routinely analyzing these collections have not kept pace . "" Because of activities like the Human Genome Project , exploratory data collection has come to be seen as more cost effective , "" said Altman , associate professor of medicine in the section on Medical Informatics at Stanford University Medical Center and leader of NPACI's Molecular Science thrust area . "" The collectors do not necessarily know why they are collecting . They figure that out later . This project will develop the infrastructure that will allow biologists to answer questions using these data collections . "" For example , a biologist might hypothesize that a protein with certain features--such as a particular sequence or structure--must exist to carry out some task in a cell . A time-consuming approach is to devise an experimental technique to search for the hypothesized protein . However , with bioinformatics techniques , the biologist can scan a collection such as the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) for proteins that meet the hypothesis criteria . LEGION-SCALE ANALYSIS The Bioinformatics Infrastructure alpha project is making a three-pronged assault on the problem : analysis , access , and movement of data . In the analysis component , participants are developing molecular scanning and comparison algorithms for various collections , and the Legion metasystem will recruit the computing resources required for large-scale analyses . "" Legion's architecture and past work on other biological codes will allow us to make progress quickly , "" said Andrew Grimshaw , the leader of the Legion effort and NPACI's Metasystems thrust area leader . "" We already have a framework for similar database analyses , which can easily take advantage of Legion's built-in fault tolerance . "" Altman's group , including Liping Wei , Allison Waugh , and Catherine Ying , have developed a scanning code that examines a PDB entry for active sites for which models exist , such as that for calcium . NPACI support has contributed to code improvements . Glenn Williams at Stanford is now working with the Legion team at the University of Virginia to modify the code to scan the entire PDB . "" Our code takes a PDB entry and derives information about potential calcium binding sites , "" Altman said . "" Any similar code could be used , and we want to make tools like these more readily available . "" The project also includes a molecular comparison algorithm for the PDB called combinatorial extension by Phil Bourne and Ilya Shindyalov at SDSC . An algorithm for phylogenetic analysis from David Hillis at the University of Texas and a genetic sequence comparison algorithm by David States at Washington University in St. Louis both run on sequence databases such as SWISS-PROT and GenBank . To run a scanning algorithm against every record in the PDB takes time proportional to the number of PDB entries . For example , Altman's code takes about 0.01 seconds per atom to scan a 3-D structure . With more than 10 million atoms in the PDB , the code takes days to scan the PDB on a workstation . All-versus-all comparisons , in contrast , take time proportional to the square of the number of entries . Last year , Bourne and Shindyalov used their combinatorial extension code , which finds similarities between structures , to compare more than 8,000 proteins in the PDB against every other protein . The effort consumed more than 24,000 processor hours on the Cray T3E at SDSC . On a workstation , the effort would have taken almost three years . Figure 1 . Growth of Biological Data The Bioinformatics Infrastructure alpha project is developing the tools and techniques for analyzing the the growing amount of biological data in databases . Left : The DNA base pairs stored in GenBank through August 1999 . Right : The structures stored and deposited in the Protein Data Bank through October 1999 . MIXED INFORMATION ACCESS In the data access component , participants from the Molecular Science and Data-Intensive Computing Environments ( DICE ) thrust areas are working to address the information access challenges of seamlessly accessing the information in different molecular data collections . When complete , the project will permit analyses to span not just one collection but several . "" The information access challenge is to take these data collections and compare them on a high-performance system such as the Centurion cluster at the University of Virginia , "" said Reagan Moore , associate director of SDSC and leader of the DICE thrust area . "" To do that , we must have definitions of how the collections are organized , and we have to understand the structure of objects in the collection . "" Operated by NPACI partners Rutgers University , SDSC , and the National Institute for Standards and Technology , the PDB is the premiere worldwide repository of 3-D protein structures , with 11,000 such structures today . Bourne leads the SDSC team . The Institute for Biomedical Computing at Washington University , directed by States , mirrors several protein and genetic databases . These databases include GenBank , which holds 3.4 billion bases in 4.6 million entries from 47,000 species , and SWISS-PROT , with 29 million amino acids in 80,000 entries ( Figure 1 ) . The collection that promises to seriously tax the data-handling infrastructure , however , is being created by Montgomery Pettitt , director of the Institute for Molecular Design at the University of Houston . Pettitt is creating a database of molecular dynamics trajectories , time-slice snapshots from molecular dynamics simulations . A one-microsecond simulation might , for example , produce a time slice every femtosecond--or one million database entries from a single simulation . This diverse set of collections will be integrated by applying technologies developed in the Mediation of Information using XML ( MIX ) project , led by Chaitan Baru at SDSC and Yannis Papakonstantinou , director of UC San Diego's Database Laboratory ( see enVision , July-September 1999 ) . The MIX software acts as a mediator between data sources with different structures , such as the collections in the alpha project . The MIX tools will use infrastructure-independent XML representations being developed by the collection maintainers to allow biologists to query , access , and analyze data from any or all of the collections from a single application or Web interface . STREAMLINED DATA MOVEMENT The data movement component joins the access and analysis components and is essential to the ultimate goal of the alpha project--large-scale analyses across more than one collection at a time . Initially , the Legion-enhanced codes will access data directly from the data collections , but the longer-term goal of moving data across the Grid is being addressed by efforts to integrate the SDSC Storage Resource Broker ( SRB ) , the cornerstone of NPACI's data-handling infrastructure , with the Legion architecture . "" The only challenge for Legion will be the amount of data the codes will produce , "" Grimshaw said . "" We do n't have enough disk space , so we 'll need some way to manage the storage . "" In addition , the code results could potentially exceed Legion's current 4-GB file size limit , and even when Legion allows larger files , the question of where to put the data remains . The SDSC SRB provides an interface to distributed , heterogeneous data resources . When requesting data through the SRB , applications and users need not know how or where a data collection is stored . With an interface between Legion and the SRB , an algorithm will be able to marshal both computing processors and data collections across the network . "" Traditionally , data movement is handled by copying files via FTP to local disk or into memory , "" Moore said . "" We need an architecture to stream the data from collections to an application on an as-needed basis . That 's where the SRB fits in . "" The DICE activities in this project build not only on NPACI activities , but also on externally funded projects with the NASA Information Power Grid , the Department of Energy's Visualization Interaction Environments for Weapons Simulation ( VIEWS ) , and the National Archives and Records Administration . BIOLOGICAL DISCOVERY While the project will require many new developments on the underlying technologies , the success of the project will be measured in part by how well the underlying infrastructure permits biology researchers to make new discoveries from the collections . For these users , the alpha project will provide a number of new resources and capabilities . First , the test codes run by the participants will provide both benchmarks and biological results . Second , the experiences of the participants will be captured in templates for performing similar analyses . Timings on resources , formulas for extrapolating from workstation runs to Legion runs , and other information will help determine the resources needed to answer a hypothesis and hence develop an NPACI allocation request . Eventually , the test codes and algorithms may be made available for execution , possibly via the Web . "" In some ways , the biology community is depending on projects like this alpha project to keep up with the rapid growth of biology data collections , "" Altman said . "" Using the Grid to marshal the resources necessary to scan databases such as the PDB and GenBank , this project will make this kind of bioinformatics capability routine .

317	"Home Improving Services Selected cases -- Parliamentary Selected Cases and Summaries of Completed Investigations - October 1998 - March 1999 C. 682 / 96 Full text Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration Sixth Report Session 1998-99 Volume 2 OCTOBER 1998 - MARCH 1999 The full report of selected cases Summary of selected cases DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY Case No. C. 682 / 96 Misleading information about eligibility for medical cover while living abroad 10.1 Mr H complained that the then Department of Health and Social Security now the Department of Social Security ( DSS ) misled him about his eligibility for medical cover while living abroad ; and that as a result he had to pay for private medical cover for himself and his wife thereby causing him financial hardship . 10.2 My investigation into Mr H's complaint began once the Ombudsman had obtained , after the referral of the complaint , comments from the Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency , an executive agency of DSS with responsibility , since 6 April 1992 , for advice on medical cover abroad . I have not put into this report every detailed investigated by the Ombudsman's staff ; but I am satisfied that no matter of significance has been overlooked . Appendix A to the report gives the meaning of the initials used in it . Back to top Background 10.3 Entitlement to sickness benefit ( SB ) and to invalidity benefit ( IVB ) to which a claimant was entitled after 28 weeks' incapacity ( both replaced from 13 April 1995 by incapacity benefit ) normally depended on the claimant's national insurance ( NI ) contribution record . ( The exceptions were where incapacity had been caused by an accident at work or was due to a prescribed occupational disease . ) Two conditions had to be satisfied . The first was that the claimant must have paid enough Class 1 ( employed persons ) and / or Class 2 ( self-employed persons ) contributions in any one tax year ( which runs from 6 April in one calendar year to 5 April in the next ) to give an earnings factor of at least 25 times the lower earnings limit for payment of contributions for that year . ( The earnings factor approximated to the earnings on which contributions had been paid . ) The second condition for claims made before 2 October 1988 was that , in the relevant tax year , the claimant must have paid or been credited with Class 1 or Class 2 contributions to give an earnings factor of at least 50 times the lower earnings limit . ( NI contribution credits could be awarded to those receiving certain benefits , including SB and IVB . ) The relevant tax year was the last complete tax year before the start of the benefit year . The benefit year was the one which contained the first day in respect of which benefit was claimed . Benefit years started on the first Sunday in January . From 2 October 1988 , the qualifying contributions had to have been paid or credited in both of the last two complete tax years before the start of the benefit year . Those entitled to IVB continued to be entitled to it if they went to live in another European Community country . SB was also payable in certain circumstances . Back to top 10.4 Those living in another European Community country and receiving United Kingdom ( UK ) IVB , retirement pension ( RP ) or widow's benefit were entitled to receive medical treatment for themselves and their dependants under the state scheme of their new country of residence . To qualify , they had to obtain a certificate of entitlement a form E121 from DSS . In completing the form , DSS certified that the person concerned was entitled to a pension for either "" old age "" , "" accident at work "" , "" invalidity , "" "" occupational disease , "" or "" survival "" . Those living in another European Community country and receiving UK SB or maternity allowance were entitled to medical cover for the length of their benefit entitlement . Those living , but not working or receiving one of the qualifying benefits , in another European Community country were entitled to medical cover for the period in respect of which they retained an underlying entitlement to UK SB . To qualify , they had to obtain a certificate of entitlement a form E106 from DSS . Enquiries from those going to live abroad are handled by the Overseas Benefit Directorate ( OBD ) of DSS who are responsible for the issue of forms E121 and E106 . Before April 1992 OBD were called Overseas Branch but for the sake of consistency I refer to them throughout this report as OBD . 10.5 A person from the UK who is abroad is normally entitled to pay UK NI contributions voluntarily to maintain his or her UK NI record for RP and certain other benefit purposes . If a person is not gainfully occupied abroad voluntary contribution has to be at the Class 3 ( non-employed ) rate . Back to top Investigation 10.6 In accordance with their normal practice , by the time the complaint was referred DSS had already routinely destroyed all correspondence in Mr H's case before 1994 . Mr H supplied the Ombudsman with letters which DSS had sent to him between 1987 and 1994 and a copy of a letter he had sent to them on 6 June 1988 ; he was unable to supply copies of the other letters which he had sent to DSS during the period . 10.7 1986 In 1986 Mr H retired early on health grounds from the police force . He received IVB from his local Benefits Agency office from 19 April to 19 July . After a short period of unemployment he requalified for IVB from 28 November 1986 . Back to top 10.8 1987 On 20 January 1987 Mr H wrote to OBD saying that he was contemplating moving to live in Spain . He told the Ombudsman's staff that in that letter he had asked specifically for advice on health cover and what he needed to do to maintain his RP rights . On 30 January OBD replied enclosing a leaflet SA 29 entitled "" Your social security , health care and pension rights in the European Community "" and a leaflet NI38 entitled "" Social Security abroad "" which included an application form to pay NI contributions while abroad . They said that it might be possible to provide him with limited medical cover ( certificate E106 ) based on his UK NI contributions when he took up residence in Spain ; but if the certificate was issued the cover could be provided only for as long as residual entitlement to SB existed . They said that , when the E106 expired , he should take out private medical insurance to cover him until his 65th birthday when cover would again be given by virtue of certificate E121 which would be issued with effect from the date his RP became payable . OBD asked Mr H to provide his NI number so that they could check his record ; the date of his intended departure ; and his address abroad . I reproduce at Appendix B , paragraphs 15 , 16 , 17 and 18 of the 1986 version of leaflet SA 29 , which appeared under the general heading "" Health Care "" and the first part of paragraph 24 which appeared under the general heading "" The benefits involved "" . 10.9 On 10 March the local Benefits Agency office sent Mr H the IVB due for the period from 4 to 17 March . On 19 March Mr H sent OBD the completed application form to pay voluntary NI contributions while abroad . He wrote an accompanying letter which he told the Ombudsman's staff had merely informed OBD of the date of his departure from the UK . Mr H and his wife moved to Spain on 20 March . Around that time ( the date is not recorded ) the local Benefits Agency office sent Mr H a form 189 asking him to provide further medical evidence if he remained incapable of work ( they held medical evidence up to 19 March ) . They received no reply and on 6 April they sent Mr H a final payment of IVB for the period from 18 to 19 March . Also on 6 April OBD wrote thanking Mr H for his correspondence . They said that , on checking his NI record , he had paid sufficient NI contributions in respect of the tax year 1985 / 86 to provide him with medical cover by virtue of certificate E106 until 3 January 1988 . They reminded Mr H that cover did not last indefinitely and that he should take out private medical insurance when the certificate expired . They said that it might be possible to provide medical care after 3 January 1988 based on the NI contributions paid in respect of the 1986 / 87 tax year ; and they asked him to contact them again six weeks before the E106 expired . The remainder of the letter dealt with Mr H's payment of voluntary contributions . On the same date , 6 April , OBD sent form E106 to the relevant Spanish authority . Back to top 10.10 1988 On 2 January 1988 Mr H wrote to OBD asking whether further medical cover was possible . On 15 February OBD issued a form E106 certifying entitlement to medical cover for the period from 4 January to 31 December . On 21 April Mr H wrote to OBD asking for a form E121 . On 18 May OBD replied saying that , as a form E121 could be issued only to a person in receipt of a UK RP , it was not applicable to Mr H's circumstances . They said that , if he and his wife were still abroad when they reached retirement age and were entitled to a UK RP , a form E121 would automatically be issued to provide medical cover in Spain . On 6 June Mr H wrote again to OBD saying that his request for a form E121 had been made as a result of information received from the Spanish authorities that the occupational pensions received by himself and his wife were sufficient to qualify them for medical cover under the Spanish state scheme . He said that he and his wife had private medical cover but it was very restricted . He said that he had seen a form E121 on which there was provision for "" other pensions "" ; and he asked if that would not cover himself and his wife or , if not , whether there was no other form with which they could be issued to produce to the Spanish authorities . On 19 July OBD replied saying that Mr H must be in receipt of RP to be entitled to a form E121 . Back to top 10.11 1994 On 24 January 1994 Mr H wrote to OBD saying that he felt that they had previously failed fully to inform him of his correct entitlement . He explained that he had had to finish work because of ill health and on 20 March 1987 had moved with his wife to Spain . He said that he had received IVB until he left the UK ; and that before leaving he had sought advice about contributions and health care . He went on to relate the information which OBD had given about medical cover in their letters of 30 January 1987 , 18 May and 19 July 1988 . He said that , after changes to European Community law in November 1993 , he had consulted his local ( Spanish ) Social Security office who had told him that nothing had changed ; but that as he had retired from work on health grounds and was receiving a pension , although he was not yet 65 years of age , he should be able to obtain a form E121 . Mr H said that his wife had recently applied for a RP forecast and had received leaflet SA 29 ( print date August 1993 ) paragraph 16 of which said that anyone receiving IVB before going to live abroad was eligible for form E121 . He said that had not been mentioned in any of the replies which he had received from OBD ; and it appeared that he had been entitled to the form but had been misinformed . Moreover , it seemed from paragraph 25 of the leaflet that IVB was payable abroad . Mr H asked whether he could have continued to receive IVB while in Spain . I reproduce at Appendix C , paragraphs 15 , 16 , 17 and the first part of paragraph 25 of the relevant ( 1993 version of ) leaflet SA 29 . Back to top 10.12 On 22 February OBD replied saying that IVB was payable in Spain provided that a person continued to satisfy the conditions for receipt of the benefit had he remained in the UK . They enclosed a claim form for Mr H to complete and return with supporting medical evidence . They reminded him that IVB was not payable for a period more than 12 months before the date of claim . On 11 March Mr H wrote to OBD saying that he had paid Class 3 ( voluntary ) contributions since going to Spain . He asked whether he could qualify for IVB ; and for advice on the medical evidence required . He also asked OBD to send him form E121 on 15 April , after obtaining his contribution record . OBD replied saying that , as he had not paid Class 1 contributions since 1987 , he could not satisfy the contribution conditions for receipt of benefit ( Class 3 contributions could not satisfy the requirements ) . On 9 May Mr H wrote again pointing out that the main point of his letter of 24 January , the request for a form E121 , had been ignored . He said that it appeared from leaflet SA 29 that he had been entitled to the form when he had left the UK because he had been receiving IVB . 10.13 On 7 June OBD wrote to Mr H saying that , as he was not in receipt of RP or IVB , they were unable to provide him with form E121 . Mr H replied on 22 June referring to paragraph 16 of leaflet SA 29 ( the current version ) and saying that he was applying retrospectively for the form E121 which should have been issued to him in 1987 when he went abroad . He said that in 1987 and 1988 OBD had wrongly told him that form E121 could be issued only to a person in receipt of RP . If they had given him the right information and issued form E121 as they should have done , he would still be covered under the Spanish health service . OBD replied on 18 August apologising for the delay in doing so . They said that , as Mr H's IVB had ended on 19 March 1987 , he was no longer entitled to form E121 ; and he could not requalify for IVB because he had not paid Class 1 NI contributions since 1987 . On 3 September Mr H wrote to OBD complaining about their failure in their letters of 30 January and 6 April 1987 , 18 May and 19 July 1988 to mention the possibility of entitlement to a form E121 on the basis of receiving IVB . He said that he had the leaflet SA 29 print date January 1986 ( which had been sent to him on 30 January 1987 see paragraph 10.8 ) and observed that paragraph 16 made no mention of form E121 , unlike paragraph 16 of the later August 1993 print of the leaflet . He said that , although he had contacted OBD two months before leaving the UK , he had never been advised of the link between entitlement to IVB and to form E121 ; and he therefore could not have known about it until reading the 1993 leaflet sent to his wife ( paragraph 10.11 ) . He asked OBD why they had not noticed when they had checked his NI record in 1987 ( paragraph 10.9 ) that he was being credited with NI contributions as a result of receiving IVB ; and he asked them to send him the form E121 which they should have sent to him when he had left the UK . He added that he had not continued his claim to IVB after leaving the UK because he had not been aware that it was payable abroad . Back to top 10.14 On 11 October OBD wrote to Mr H saying that they were unable to give him a form E121 because he was not entitled to IVB ; but , in view of his comments in his letter of 3 September , they were looking again at his case . On 1 November OBD wrote to Mr H saying that , according to their records , they had sent him information about benefit entitlement abroad but he had not continued his ( IVB ) claim when he had left the UK . They said that any new claim would not succeed because of the contribution and late claim conditions ( paragraph 10.12 ) , but NI credits might be awarded if he supplied medical evidence of incapacity for work . They asked him to let them know if he wanted to make a claim . On 17 November Mr H wrote to OBD making a claim for NI credits and enclosing medical evidence . He said he was confused by the correspondence and asked whether his request for a form E121 was still being considered . On 29 November OBD told Mr H that his case would be looked at again and that he would receive a full reply to his letter of 17 November shortly . 10.15 1995 On 19 January 1995 Mr H wrote to OBD asking for a decision on his request for a form E121 . On 15 March OBD replied saying that they could issue form E121 only if Mr H was entitled to and receiving IVB ; as that was not the case , they were unable to do so . On 5 April OBD told Mr H that NI credits had been awarded from 9 September 1993 . 10.16 1996 On 9 April 1996 , after further correspondence between Mr H and OBD , Mr H asked the then Member of Parliament who jointly chaired the All Party Group for Pensioners to refer his complaint to the then Ombudsman . The Member did so on 3 May . In October 1996 an adjudication officer ( AO ) decided that , from 10 October , Mr H could not be treated as incapable of work ; and that as a result he was not entitled to NI incapacity credits from that date . ( Mr H subsequently made an unsuccessful appeal against the AO's decision . ) 10.17 In his comments on the case the Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency said that there was no evidence to suggest that Mr H had been incapacitated when he had left the UK to live in Spain ; his last medical certificate had expired on 19 March 1987 and he had made no enquiries about continuing payment of benefit abroad . The leaflet SA 29 which had been sent to him on 30 January 1987 had provided guidance on medical cover ; and it had clearly said that IVB was payable abroad and those receiving it were entitled to medical cover . The Chief Executive said that the failure on the part of OBD later , in 1988 , to include specific reference to IVB in letters was regrettable ; but had been based entirely on the information available at the time . IVB had neither been in payment nor mentioned by Mr H in his correspondence until January 1994 . Turning to Mr H's statement that , when OBD had been considering the issue of form E106 in 1987 ( paragraphs 10.9 and 10.13 ) , it should have been evident from his NI contribution record that he had been in receipt of NI credits for IVB , the Chief Executive said that , at the time of Mr H's departure from the UK , the tax year 1986 / 87 had not ended and as a result there would have been no record of any credits for that year on his NI account . He said that credits were not recorded until well after the end of the tax year . It would have been impossible , therefore , for OBD to have known in April 1997 that Mr H had been receiving IVB from his local DSS office when he had first written in January 1997 . Back to top 10.18 In conclusion , the Chief Executive said that it was unfortunate that the letters to Mr H in 1988 had not mentioned form E121 being applicable to those receiving IVB as well as RP . That had been an omission which the Department recognised . However , the Chief Executive said , Mr H had neither received nor mentioned IVB after his departure abroad . Additionally , leaflet SA 29 had provided clear guidance about medical cover and receipt of benefit abroad . Taking those facts into account , there were no grounds for reimbursement of health costs incurred by Mr H from 1 January 1989 , the expiry date of the form E106 . On 16 January 1997 the Chief Executive wrote to Mr H apologising for any trouble and inconvenience caused by the less than satisfactory service he had received . In the course of my investigation one of the Ombudsman's officers received confirmation from OBD that had Mr H claimed benefit in 1988 he would have been within time , as the requirements then stood , for payment ( paragraph 10.3 ) . Back to top Findings 10.19 The letter which OBD sent to Mr H on 30 January 1987 ( paragraph 10.8 ) was correct as far as it went but it was misleading in that it omitted information about the entitlement to medical cover in another European Community country of those receiving UK SB , IVB , maternity allowance or widow's benefit . That was a serious omission for which I criticise them . In my view , OBD should either have covered all the circumstances in which medical cover was available ; or none of them and simply directed Mr H to the information in the leaflet SA 29 , offering further advice on any particular aspect if needed . The 1986 version of leaflet SA 29 , which OBD sent to Mr H , contained all that he needed to know about medical cover abroad ; but the presentation of some of that information gave me cause for concern . 10.20 Paragraph 16 of the leaflet was the one which covered the link between IVB and medical cover ( Appendix B ) but I found the heading to the paragraph misleading in that it referred to "" State pensioners "" . It seemed to me that those like Mr H receiving IVB would not have regarded themselves as pensioners and might therefore have been dissuaded from reading further . Similarly , the text of the paragraph referred to invalidity pension . I was pleased to see that the relevant heading and the text in the later ( 1993 ) issue of the leaflet had been changed ( Appendix C ) . I noted also that the paragraph failed to make clear that IVB ( and RP and widow's benefit ) had to be in payment abroad , rather than in payment before departure , to give entitlement to medical cover . In 1994 when Mr H read both the 1986 and 1993 versions of the leaflet ( paragraphs 10.11 to 10.14 ) he was misled by the wording of paragraph 16 on that very point . Be all that as it may , paragraph 16 did not stand in isolation and , given Mr H's circumstances in 1987 , I consider it reasonable to have expected him also to have read that part of the leaflet concerned with social security benefits . If he had done so , he would have known that he could continue to claim IVB after he moved to Spain ( Appendix B ) ; and I am confident from what he said in his letter of 3 September 1994 ( paragraph 10.13 ) that that is what he would have done instead of allowing it to lapse . He would then have been entitled to a form E121 for as long as his entitlement to IVB continued . It follows that I do not think that OBD's less than comprehensive letter of 30 January 1987 was crucial to Mr H's future action ; the leaflet which they sent him at the same time should have been sufficient to set him on the right track . Back to top 10.21 Mr H asked why , when OBD checked his NI record in 1987 , the credit of NI contributions , because of his receipt of IVB , had not been spotted ( paragraph 10.13 ) . I have seen Mr H's NI account which OBD examined in April 1987 ( paragraph 10.9 ) and again in February 1988 ( paragraph 10.10 ) before issuing forms E106 . The Chief Executive has explained that , in April 1987 , the last tax year for which details were recorded was 1985 / 86 ( paragraph 10.17 ) . That year showed Class 1 NI contributions to the value of Â£ 905.64 paid on Mr H's employment with the police force . When OBD examined Mr H's NI account again in February 1988 ( paragraph 10.10 ) , the details of the tax year 1986 / 87 had been recorded . They showed Class 1 NI contributions to the value of Â£ 144.96 paid on Mr H's employment with the police force , 30 NI credits awarded by the local Benefits Agency office , and nine credits awarded by the local Unemployment Benefit office . I am satisfied that the information on Mr H's NI account was not such that OBD , either in April 1987 or February 1988 , should have taken action other than they did . 10.22 That is though not the end of the matter . On 21 April 1988 Mr H asked OBD for a form E121 believing , after discussion with the Spanish authorities , that the occupational pensions received by himself and his wife qualified them for medical cover in Spain ( paragraph 10.10 ) . The response he received that only those receiving UK RP qualified for the form was clearly wrong . Moreover , when Mr H challenged the advice OBD repeated it a second time despite their attention having been drawn to the wording on the form E121 which referred to pensions other than those for retirement ( paragraph 10.4 ) . That was a serious error for which I criticise OBD . The question which arises from their error is what would have been the outcome if it had not occurred . As I saw it , if OBD had given Mr H as they should have done a full description of the benefits and pensions which entitled a person to a form E121 , he would have begun the sort of enquiries which he began six years later in 1994 ( paragraph 10.11 ) . Moreover , I am satisfied that those enquiries would have led to the realisation that he could have continued his claim to IVB after going to live in Spain . It seemed to me , therefore , that the incorrect information which OBD had given to Mr H in 1988 had prevented him from making a late claim for SB / IVB which he otherwise would have made ; and I thought that DSS should put that right by placing him as far as that was now possible in the position in which he would have been had he made such a claim . I suggested that should involve DSS taking a view on the value of any lost entitlement to benefit ; of any voluntary NI contributions which Mr H had paid unnecessarily ; and of any medical costs incurred as a consequence of lost entitlement to medical cover . Accordingly , I asked the Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency to consider Mr H's case in the light of my comments . Back to top 10.23 I am pleased to report that the Chief Executive replied that it had been decided to make Mr H an ex gratia payment subject to enquiries to determine whether he had satisfied the conditions for benefit in the period from 1988 to 1994 ; and to the production of evidence of his medical costs . DSS subsequently awarded Mr H an ex gratia payment of Â£ 35,648.74 to replace his lost statutory entitlement to SB , IVB and incapacity benefit from 21 March 1988 ( the maximum backdating which could have been allowed in Mr H's case under the law at the time was one month ) to 9 October 1996 ( when he was deemed capable of work see paragraph 10.16 ) ; and an ex gratia payment of Â£ 3,901.98 to meet the cost of medical insurance which Mr H incurred in the period from 1 January 1989 to 31 December 1996 plus interest on that sum of Â£ 909.86 . DSS will also pay Mr H interest on the sum of Â£ 35,648.74 which they have yet to calculate and which is likely to amount to between Â£ 9,500 and Â£ 10,000 . In addition , they have undertaken either to award Class 1 NI credits to Mr H in respect of the period from 21 March 1988 to 9 October 1996 and to refund with interest the Class 3 ( voluntary ) contributions which he paid for that period ; or to reimburse him the cost of the Class 3 contributions with compensation for the loss of use of the money . 10.24 One final matter deserves mention . My investigation has shown that Mr H's claim of misdirection , which he made in January 1994 ( paragraph 10.11 ) , was handled badly by OBD . They failed to address the issue , despite several letters from him ( paragraphs 10.12 and 10.13 ) , for some nine months and then only superficially ( paragraph 10.14 ) . I criticise them for their poor response to Mr H's representations . Back to top Conclusion 10.25 OBD dealt poorly with Mr H's enquiries about medical cover both before and after he moved to live in Spain . The incorrect information which they gave him in 1988 caused him financial loss for which DSS have agreed fully to compensate him by awarding ex gratia payments of Â£ 35,648.74 to replace his lost statutory entitlement to benefit plus interest on that sum which is likely to amount to between Â£ 9,500 and Â£ 10,000 ; Â£ 3,901.98 to meet the cost of medical insurance plus Â£ 909.86 interest on that sum ; and undertaking either to refund with interest Class 3 ( voluntary ) NI contributions which Mr H has paid unnecessarily or to reimburse him the cost of the Class 3 contributions which he has paid in respect of the period from 21 March 1988 to 9 October 1996 with compensation for the loss of use of the money . I regard all that , together with the Chief Executive's apologies for OBD's poor service ( paragraph 10.18 ) , as a satisfactory response to a justified complaint .

1653	"Kingsbridge ( also known as Lower Riverdale ) is a working - and middle-class residential neighborhood geographically located in the northwest portion of The Bronx in New York City . Kingsbridge is actually made up of three distinct neighborhoods : Kingsbridge proper , Kingsbridge Heights , and Van Cortlandt Village . The neighborhood is considered a part of Bronx Community Board 8 , and is sometimes considered a sub-section of Riverdale , since it shares the same zip code 10463 with Riverdale . Kingsbridge proper's ill-defined boundaries are Van Cortlandt Park to the north , Bailey Avenue to the east , West 230st Street to the south , and Broadway to the west . Kingsbridge is patrolled by the New York City Police Department ' s 50th Precinct . Contents Kingsbridge has detached , semi detached , and attached homes , and Broadway has apartment buildings where many Dominicans reside . Streets connecting Riverdale and Kingsbridge include "" step streets "" , with stairways of as many as 160 steps climbing the slope . Some jokingly refer to Riverdale as the "" rich uncle "" of Kingsbridge which has its origins during the Irish period . The neighborhood is also part of a business improvement district that is home to 200 merchants , which is one of the largest retail shopping districts in the Bronx . River Plaza Shopping Center is located nearby ( in Marble Hill , Manhattan ) but it is not part of the business improvement district . During the past several years there have been significant improvements in the infrastructure of the community . For example , the parks have been improved significantly and there are new elementary schools on 230th Street . Nathalie Avenue in the 1890s , now called Kingsbridge Terrace 50th Precinct The neighborhood is named for the King's Bridge , erected in 1693 by Frederick Philipse , a local lord loyal to the British monarch . The bridge spanned a now-filled-in section of Spuyten Duyvil Creek , roughly parallel to today's 230th Street . The King's Bridge was part of Boston Post Road , connecting southern Westchester County ( which later became the Bronx ) with Marble Hill , once part of Manhattan Island and still part of the borough of Manhattan . The bridge is said to still be in place , having been buried when the creek bed was filled in . The creek's water flow was redirected to the new and deeper shipping canal , south of Marble Hill . Until the latter part of the 19th century Riverdale , Kingsbridge , and other areas now in the northwest Bronx were part of the Town of Yonkers . The areas that are inside the modern-day New York city line broke off to form the Town of Kingsbridge . In 1874 , the City of New York annexed three towns that later became the western half of The Bronx , including the Town of Kingsbridge . As the trains to Manhattan were built in the 20th century , a stop in the northwest Bronx along the Hudson River called Riverdale-on-Hudson , now Riverdale , was created . This gave rise to the Riverdale neighborhood . The remainder of the old Town of Kingsbridge developed into the modern-day Kingsbridge neighborhood . Kingsbridge has a population of over 10,000 . It was once a neighborhood of predominately Irish immigrants . From the late 1970s the Irish population has decreased significantly , being replaced by large numbers of African-Americans , Hispanics , Asians , Albanians , and Greeks . The largest Hispanic group in Kingsbridge today are Dominicans , replacing the earlier Puerto Ricans and Cubans , who were the first Hispanics to settle in the neighborhood in the 1970s . There still is a strong Irish population centered on Bailey Avenue and Tibbett Avenue . The Dominicans predominantly live along Broadway and adjacent side streets , with a predominantly mixed ethnic area east and west of Broadway . The Irish legacy can still be seen in the Roman Catholic churches and schools that serve the current residents , such as the St. John's Roman Catholic Church on Kingsbridge Avenue near 231st Street , and its two schools ; the elementary school on Godwin Terrace ( just south of 231st Street ) , and the junior high school on Kingsbridge Avenue just a block north of 231st Street . In northern Kingsbridge the Visitation Roman Catholic Church and School is located on West 239th street . To the east , on Sedgwick Avenue is Our Lady of Angels Church and School . For recreation Gaelic Park , ( now operated by Manhattan College ) , is located on 240th Street & Broadway and is the venue for a variety of sports including Gaelic football and hurling . The neighborhood is also home to Manhattan College . The area is patrolled by the 50th Precinct located at 3450 Kingsbridge Avenue . NYCHA property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 8 at 2794 Randall Avenue in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx . Kingsbridge was home to the 77-year-old Stella D ' Oro factory , which was relocated to Ashland , Ohio when Stella D ' Oro was sold to Lance after labor unrest in 2009 .

447	This domain identifies a group of enzymes belongs to the GHMP kinase domain superfamily in the archaea . GHMP kinases are a unique class of ATP-dependent enzymes ( the abbreviation of which refers to the original members : galactokinase , homoserine kinase , mevalonate kinase , and phosphomevalonate kinase ) [ 1 ] . Enzymes belonging to this superfamily contain three well-conserved motifs , the second of which has the typical sequence Pro-X-X-X-Gly-Leu-X-Ser-Ser-Ala and is involved in ATP binding [ 2 ] . The phosphate binding loop in GHMP kinases is distinct from the classical P-loops found in many ATP / GTP binding proteins . The bound ADP molecule adopts a rare syn conformation and is in the opposite orientation from those bound to the P-loop-containing proteins [ 2 ] . GHMP kinases display a distinctly bilobal appearance with their N-terminal subdomains dominated by a mixed beta-sheet flanked on one side by alpha-helices and their C-terminal subdomains containing a four stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet [ 3 , 2 , 4 , 5 ] . There are currently no experimental data for members of this family , and their exact biochemical and biological functions are not known yet .	Information/Explanation

The scientific revolution entailed a major change in viewing the ocean basins and continents . Before the scientific revolution , the ocean basins were viewed as passive containers for the oceans . The continents and ocean basins were viewed as permanent features that had remained in their present positions through most of Earth's history . The marine mineral provisions of the Convention were written in terms of this old view , which only recognized those marine mineral deposits that had been derived from erosion of land and carried into the ocean in particulate or dissolved form by rivers . These minerals comprised heavy metal deposits ( tin , gold , etc. ) and gemstones ( especially diamonds ) deposited in sediments on continental margins , and manganese nodules precipitated on the floor of the deep ocean from metals dissolved in seawater . The scientific revolution revealed that the ocean basins are dynamic features that open and close on a time scale of millions of years , with concomitant movement of the land areas known as continental drift . The scientific revolution recognized the ocean basins as sources of types of mineral deposits in addition to those previously known . These newly recognized types of marine mineral resources include polymetallic sulphides containing copper , zinc , silver and gold in varying amounts . Polymetallic sulphide deposits are concentrated over thousands of years by seafloor hot springs at sites along an active global submerged volcanic mountain range that extends through all the ocean basins of the world . Polymetallic sulphide deposits also occur at sites associated with volcanic island chains such as those along the western boundary of the Pacific Ocean . Another newly recognized type of marine mineral resource is cobalt-rich iron-manganese crusts that are precipitated over millions of years on the submerged flanks of inactive underwater volcanoes from metals dissolved in seawater derived from input of metals by both rivers and seafloor hot springs . The hot springs not only concentrate polymetallic sulphide deposits and disperse metals into the oceans that contribute to the accumulation of cobalt-rich iron-manganese crusts , but also provide chemical energy from the Earth's interior that is used by microbes for their growth . The microbes are at the base of the food chain of an ecosystem of life forms at the hot springs that is largely independent of the light energy that fuels the photosynthesis in plants at the base of the food chain on land . The microbes are proving important as the source of new compounds for industrial and medical applications , and also include primitive forms that may hold the key to the origin of life . A current challenge is to incorporate these new mineral resources into the Convention regime in a way that protects the valuable life forms that they host . Polymetallic massive sulphide deposits at the modern seafloor and their resource potential2 Since 1979 , polymetallic massive sulphide deposits have been found at water depths up to 3,700 m in a variety of tectonic settings at the modern seafloor , including mid-ocean ridges , back-arc rifts and seamounts . Many of the sulphide deposits consist of a black smoker complex on top of a sulphide mound which commonly is underlain by a stockwork zone . It has been widely established that circulating seawater which is modified in a reaction zone close to a subaxial magma chamber is the principal carrier of metals and sulphur which are leached out of the oceanic basement . Precipitation of massive and stockwork sulphides at and beneath the seafloor takes place in response to mixing of the high-temperature ( up to 400 Â° C ) metal-rich hydrothermal seawater fluid with ambient seawater . Polymetallic seafloor sulphide deposits can reach considerable size ( up to 100 million tonnes ) and often carry high concentrations of copper ( chalcopyrite ) , zinc ( sphalerite ) and lead ( galena ) in addition to gold and silver . It has been clearly documented that the mineralogical and chemical composition of polymetallic massive sulphides at the basalt-dominated mid-ocean ridges differs from those at back-arc spreading centres which are associated with more felsic volcanic rocks ( dacite , rhyolite ) . The latter are more similar to major sulphide deposits that are being mined on land today but which were once formed at spreading centres of paleo-oceans . Extremely high concentrations of gold ( up to 230 g / t with an average of 26 g / t for 40 samples analysed ) have recently been found in a new type of seafloor mineral deposit located in the crater of an extinct volcano in the territorial waters of Papua New Guinea . The particular style of mineralization and alteration bears many similarities to so-called "" epithermal gold deposits "" so far only known on the continents . In addition to circulating seawater , magmatic fluids carrying high concentrations of gold appear to be a significant metal source and are likely responsible for the strong precious metal enrichment . This type of mineralization is most likely to exist in other arc-related environments of the world's oceans . Due to the high concentration of base and precious metals , seafloor polymetallic sulphide deposits have recently attracted the interest of the international mining industry . The recovery of some of these deposits appears to be both economically and environmentally feasible due to certain advantages over land-based deposits and will likely become a reality within the present decade . Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts : geology , resources and technology3 Cobalt-rich iron-manganese crusts occur throughout the global ocean on seamounts , ridges and plateaux where currents have kept the rocks swept clean of sediments for millions of years . Crusts precipitate from cold ambient seawater onto rock substrates , forming pavements up to 250 mm thick . Crusts are important as a potential resource primarily for cobalt , but also for titanium , cerium , nickel , platinum , manganese , thallium , tellurium , tungsten , bismuth , zirconium and other metals . Crusts form at water depths of about 400-4 , 000 m , with the thickest and most cobalt-rich crusts occurring at depths of about 800-2 , 500 m . Gravity processes such as landslides , as well as sediment cover , submerged and emergent reefs , and currents control the distribution and thickness of crusts . Crusts occur on a wide variety of substrate rocks , making it difficult to distinguish the crusts from the substrate using remotely sensed data , which is an important aspect in terms of developing exploration technologies . Fortunately , crusts can be distinguished from the substrates by their much higher levels of gamma radiation . The physical properties of crusts , such as high mean porosity ( 60 per cent ) and extremely high mean surface area ( 300 m2 / g ) , as well as their incredibly slow rates of growth ( 1-6 millimetres per million years ) , are instrumental in allowing for the adsorption of large quantities of economically important metals from seawater onto the crust surfaces . Crusts are composed of the minerals vernadite ( manganese oxide ) and feroxyhyte ( iron oxide ) , with moderate amounts of carbonate fluorapatite ( CFA ) in thick crusts and minor amounts of quartz and feldspar in most crusts . Elements that commonly adsorbed on the vernadite include cobalt , nickel , zinc and thallium , and on the iron oxide , copper , lead , titanium , molybdenum , arsenic , vanadium , tungsten , zirconium , bismuth and tellurium . Bulk crusts contain maximum cobalt contents of up to 1.7 per cent , nickel to 1.1 per cent , and platinum to 1.3 parts per million ( ppm ) . Average cobalt contents of up to 0.5 to 1 per cent for large regions of the oceans make crusts the richest potential ore for cobalt that exists , onshore as well as offshore . Cobalt , nickel , titanium and platinum concentrations decrease , whereas silicon and aluminium increase in continental-margin crusts and in crusts with close proximity to West Pacific volcanic arcs . Vernadite-related elements decrease , whereas iron and copper increase with increasing water depth of crust occurrence . Cobalt , cerium , thallium , titanium , lead , tellurium and platinum are strongly concentrated in crusts over other metals because they are incorporated by oxidation reactions that produce more stable , less mobile compounds . Total rare-earth elements commonly vary between 0.1 per cent and 0.3 per cent and are derived from seawater along with other hydrogenetic elements , cobalt , manganese , nickel , etc. Cerium is a rare-earth element that is strongly enriched in crusts and has important economic potential . The seamounts and ridges on which crusts grow obstruct the flow of oceanic water masses , thereby creating a wide array of seamount-generated currents of generally enhanced energy relative to flow away from the seamounts . The effects of these currents are strongest at the outer rim of the summit region of seamounts , the area where the thickest crusts are found . Those seamount-specific currents also enhance turbulent mixing and produce upwelling , which increases primary productivity . These physical processes affect seamount biological communities , which vary from seamount to seamount . Seamount communities are characterized by relatively low density and low diversity where the crusts are thickest and cobalt-rich . The make-up of the seamount communities is determined by current patterns , topography , bottom sediment and rock types and coverage , seamount size , water depth , and size and magnitude of the oxygen-minimum zone . Environmental impact documents will require a much better understanding of seamount ecosystems and communities than currently exits . About 40 research cruises have been dedicated to the study of cobalt-rich crusts , mainly by Germany , Japan , United States of America , the Republic of Korea , the Russia Federation , China and France . The estimate of 40 cruises does not include some cruises completed by the USSR ( and later the Russia Federation ) and China that are not available to the author . However , based on an estimated 42 research cruises from 1981 through 2001 , it is suggested that minimum expenditures were about US $ 32 million for ship and associated scientific operations related to fieldwork , and $ 42 million for shore-based research , for a total investment of about $ 74 million . Research and development on the technology for mining crusts are only in their infancy . Detailed maps of crust deposits and a comprehensive understanding of small-scale seamount topography are not available , but are required to design the most appropriate mining strategies . Typical field operations for exploration have been to produce SeaBeam bathymetric maps and derivative back-scatter and slope-angle maps , along with seismic profiles , which are used together to select sampling sites . For reconnaissance work , 15 to 20 dredge hauls and cores are taken per seamount . Then video-camera surveys delineate crust , rock and sediment types and distributions , as well as crust thicknesses if possible . These exploration activities require the use of a large , well-equipped research vessel because of the large number of bottom acoustic beacons , the large towed equipment and the volume of samples collected . During advanced stages of exploration and site-specific surveys , it is suggested to use deep-towed side-scan sonar including swath bathymetry , and tethered remotely operated vehicles ( ROVs ) for mapping and delineation of small-scale topography . Extensive sampling of deposits can be accomplished by dredging , coring , using ROVs , and a device to take close-spaced samples that has not yet been developed . Gamma-radiation surveys will delineate crust thicknesses and the existence of crusts under thin blankets of sediment . Current-meter moorings will be required for an understanding of the seamount environment and biological sampling and surveys will be necessary . Twelve criteria have been developed for exploration for and exploitation of crusts : ( a ) Regional criteria ( i ) Large volcanic edifices shallower than 1 , 000-1 , 500 m ; ( ii ) Volcanic edifices older than 20 million years ; ( iii ) Volcanic structures not capped by large atolls or reefs ; ( iv ) Areas of strong and persistent bottom currents ; ( v ) A shallow and well-developed oxygen-minimum zone ; ( vi ) Areas isolated from input of abundant fluvial and eolian debris . ( b ) Site-specific criteria ( vii ) Subdued small-scale topography ; ( viii ) Summit terraces , saddles and passes ; ( ix ) Slope stability ; ( x ) Absence of local volcanism ; ( xi ) Average cobalt contents â¥ 0 . 8 per cent ; ( xii ) Average crust thicknesses â¥ 40 mm . Crust mining is technologically more difficult than manganese nodule mining . Recovery of nodules is relatively easy because they sit on a soft-sediment substrate , whereas crusts are weakly to strongly attached to substrate rock . For successful crust mining , it is essential to recover the crusts without collecting substrate rock , which would significantly dilute the ore grade . Five possible crust mining operations include fragmentation , crushing , lifting , pick-up and separation . The proposed method of crust recovery consists of a bottom-crawling vehicle attached to a surface-mining vessel by means of a hydraulic-pipe lift system and an electrical umbilical . The mining machine provides its own propulsion and travels at a speed of about 20 cm / s. Material throughput for the base-case mining scenario is 1,000,000 t / y . That scenario allows 80 per cent fragmentation efficiency and 25 per cent dilution of crust with substrate as reasonable miner capabilities . Some new and innovative systems that have been suggested for crust mining include water-jet stripping of crusts from the substrate , in situ leaching techniques and sonic removal of crusts from substrates . These suggestions offer promise and need to be further developed . The importance to the world economy of metals contained in crusts is reflected in their patterns of consumption . The primary uses of manganese , cobalt and nickel are in the manufacture of steel , to which they provide unique characteristics . Cobalt is also used in the electrical , communications , aerospace , and engine and tool manufacturing industries . Nickel is used additionally in chemical plants , petroleum refineries , electrical appliances and motor vehicles . Cobalt is produced as a by-product of copper mining and consequently the supply of cobalt is tied to the demand for copper . This is also true for tellurium , which is produced as a by-product of both copper and gold mining . This uncertainty in supply has caused industry to seek alternatives to cobalt and tellurium , resulting in only a modest growth in their markets over the past decade , and consequently relatively low prices . If substantial alternative sources of these metals are developed , there should be a greater incentive to reintroduce them in products and expanding markets . It has recently been determined that crusts contain metals other than manganese , cobalt , nickel , copper and platinum that may offer additional incentives in recovery . For example , titanium has the highest value after cobalt , cerium has a greater value than nickel , zirconium is equivalent to nickel , and tellurium has nearly twice the value of copper . This analysis assumes that economic extractive metallurgy can be developed for each of those metals . Based on grade , tonnage and oceanographic conditions , the central-equatorial Pacific region offers the best potential for crust mining , particularly the exclusive economic zone of Johnston Island ( United States ) , the Marshall Islands and international waters in the Mid-Pacific Mountains , although the exclusive economic zone of French Polynesia , Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia should also be considered . Supplies of the many metals found in crusts are essential for maintaining the efficiency of modern industrial societies and in improving the standard of living in the twenty-first century . There is a growing recognition that cobalt-rich crusts are an important potential resource . Accordingly , it is necessary to fill the information gap concerning various aspects of crust mining through research , exploration and technology development . Sulphide mineral resource exploitation and the hydrothermal vent fauna4 More than 500 new animal species have been described from deep-sea hydrothermal vents since their discovery in 1977 . Deep-sea vents have a high scientific value because they contain a large number of endemic and unusual species and are refuges for close relatives of ancient forms of life . Because they are visually spectacular , extreme environments , vent ecosystems have generated widespread public interest and are a resource which can be used to inform the public about earth processes and the way in which scientists work . It is not currently possible to predict how rapidly vent sites may recover from mining operations . Some organisms will be directly killed by mining machinery , while others nearby risk smothering by material settling from plumes of particulate matter . Individuals surviving these perturbations would be subject to a radical change in habitat , and the exploited sites will have a lesser scientific and educational value . Long-lived vent fields that host the largest mineral deposits are likely to be the most ecologically stable and have the highest biodiversity . A concentration of mining activities at such sites could produce regional effects on biological processes and organism abundance , to the point where the survival of some species could become an issue . The management or protection of all of the world's marine hydrothermal and seep sites is an unrealistic goal . Discussions should focus instead on the criteria for identifying sites for future protection that are of critical importance , or particularly sensitive to disturbance , because of their scientific or educational value or their significance for species survival .

986	Councils will not slow down despite recycling target capping 15 December 2004 High-performing councils have said they will not be slowing down their recycling efforts even though the government has capped all recycling targets at 30 % . Concern had been expressed this week that high-performing councils might ease off their recycling efforts because Defra decided to limit recycling targets for 2005 / 06 . Just over 100 English councils had been set household waste recycling targets of 30 % or higher before Defra's ruling late last week . But many of the high-performing councils have said that they will still aim to reach the 30 % mark or higher . Some authorities believe that Defra's decision may have been taken to win pre-election favour by limiting pressure on the Council Tax . They feel that recycling targets will go up again after an election . Other reasons given by the councils for not slowing their recycling included forthcoming Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme targets , recycling grants provided by Defra and the importance of maintaining public motivation for recycling . Several councils stated that , due to the increase in waste produced by their residents , they were unlikely to achieve the original targets , and some said 30 % was still too high . In total 103 councils are affected by the recycling cap , with those such as Daventry and Lichfield district councils already achieving household waste recycling rates above 40 % .

Nature of problem : The program calculates elastic scattering differential cross sections , probabilities , and cross sections for inelastic scattering in nuclear collisions at intermediate and high energies ( Elab > = 50 MeV / nucleon ) . It is particularly useful in the analysis of experiments with stable and unstable nuclear beams running at several intermediate-energy heavy ion accelerators around the world . Solution method : Eikonal wavefunctions are used for the scattering . For each "" impact parameter "" entering the scattering matrix elements , one solves coupled-channels equations for the time dependent Coulomb + nuclear field expanded into multipoles . A four-point Runge-Kutta procedure is used to solve the coupled-channels equations . The elastic scattering is calculated purely with the eikonal approximation . The coupled-channels is a separate calculation for the inelastic amplitudes . The inelastic couplings , therefore , have no effect on the obtained elastic scattering cross sections . Running time : Almost all the CPU time is consumed by the solution of the coupled-channels equations . It is about 2 min on a 1GHz Intel P4-processor machine for the inclusion of 5 nuclear states ."

925	"WEST BRITON , July 13 , 1838 John KINSMAN , 23 , was charged with having feloniously broken into the dwelling house of William TREVAN , and stolen therefrom 37 sovereigns , seven half-crowns , and three shillings . Mr. E. Coode having stated the case called William TREVAN , who said that he lived in Will Town , in the parish of St. Dominick ; he as a labouring man , and worked under the surveyor of roads . Had a wife , but no family , was in the habit of purchasing barley , potatoes , and other things for feeding pigs ; his wife had been a very independent woman , and had contrived to save some money . In the month of April , prosecutor had 37 sovereigns , seven half-crowns , and three shillings ; he kept it in a large red pocket-book , in a little box locked ; it was kept by his bed-side ; his house consisted of a bed-room , a room under the back house , a pig's house , and garden ; there was another house under the same roof , occupied by a neighbour ; there was a door leading from the kitchen to the back room , and another into the orchard ; saw the money last on the 29th of April ; his wife went to the box after that , and witness went on Sunday the 6th of May ; the pocket-book then contained the money ; remembered Wednesday , the 9th of May ; having passed through the back-door , witness barred it , and let the dropper fall , to prevent the bar being pushed back ; went to work at six o ' clock , and left his wife at home ; she was in the habit of going to work too ; Wednesday was Callington market day , and it was arranged that witness and his wife should meet there in the evening ; his wife was about nine years ago an inmate of the lunatic asylum ; she recovered from that illness and remained well until now ; witness left her at home ; she had been confined three weeks , and was not able to come and give evidence ; in consequence of what she told witness on Wednesday , he went home and examined the door of the back house ; there was a great hole broken in about half way up the door that leads from the orchard , and which he had barred in the morning . Witness found the box in the back-house ; the clothes were tumbled , and the box had been opened ; did not find his pocket-book or money there ; witness found two crooked sticks in the orchard , by which one of the doors could be opened after the hole was made . Knew the prisoner , he once occupied a room over the back house ; he was in the habit of coming to witness' house a great deal , and knew the premises very well ; he was there on the 5th of May , and witness did not see him between that day and the 9th . The prisoner was a miner . Cross-examined by Mr. John - Witness left his wife at home ; was quite sure that on the 6th of May , the prisoner did not rob the money , though it was on a Sunday night . Witness never showed the money to the prisoner , but his wife told the wife of the prisoner what money they had . Re-examined : Was at home when the prisoner called on the 6th of May , and they both left together ; the prisoner's wife left a waiter and umbrella for half-a-crown that prosecutor lent the prisoner to pay his rent ; his mother came shortly afterwards to redeem the umbrella and left the waiter ; the prisoner came on the 6th to know whether he might have the waiter and witness replied in the affirmative . The prisoner lived at Calstock . Thomas Peters lived at Metherill , between Calstock and Will Town ; recollected seeing the prisoner at Metherill on the day of the robbery between seven and eight o ' clock in the morning ; he went towards Callington where he said he was going . Cross-examined : Metherill was about two miles from Will Town . It was the high road where the prisoner was , and witness had seen him there many times before . Abraham BODDY lives at Metherill , and was at Callington on the day of the robbery ; on his return , he met the prisoner , between eight and nine in the morning , at a place called Cleave , and said he would be going from Will Town to Callington ; by going through a wood from Cleeve to Will Town , nearly half a mile would be saved , and the prisoner might have gone that way . The prisoner had his jacket off , and was walking at a pretty good pace . Cross-examined by Mr. Bennallack - Mertherill lies east from Will Town , and Cleave lies between both . Joseph COCKING examined : I live at Latchley , in the parish of Calstock ; am captain and manager of Gunnis Lake mine ; the last pay-day of April was the 28th ; that was also a setting day ; knows the prisoner ; he came there on the 28th , and took a pitch on the mine ; after the day was over , we had several who applied to have some money lent to them , and the prisoner applied for the loan of 5s . I refused to lend it , because he had not worked ; he said he had no money to live upon , and I told him that if he would work a short time I would lend him some ; he came to work after the 28th , and on the 3rd of May I went down with him . I came up with him on Monday the 7th , and I do not know that he again came on the mine till the next Wednesday , when I was sent for about ten o ' clock ; I was on the western part of the mine , and was sent for to come down to the smith's shop , where the prisoner was making a disturbance , having beat his wife and knocked down his sister ; he had his clothes in a bundle ; I told him he must leave the mine - that he should not work there any more ; he said he would not leave , and I went to put him off the mine , and said "" you have not a shilling to live upon , and why do you act in this way ? "" He said "" I can show more sovereigns than you can . "" I said "" where did you get sovereigns from - for it is very strange , as when you came here you were starving . "" He did not show me any ; I had not paid him any wages between the 28th of April and that time . Abel HARPER sworn : I am a miner living in Calstock , and working at Gunnis Lake Mine ; I know a beer shop kept there by a person called Doidge ; it is not very far from Gunnis Lake ; I was there on the 5th of May , and recollect seeing the prisoner there about nine o ' clock in the evening ; he asked me whether I would go to Tavistock with him the next day ; he said I should have a sovereign if I wanted it , to go along with him the next day ; I saw one sovereign ; I agreed to go with him ; I went with him and his brother . On the road to Tavistock we stopped at different homes and took refreshments for which the prisoner and his brother paid ; on the road between Gunnis Lake he showed me some sovereigns ; when we got to Tavistock , we had plenty to eat and drink ; we went to a shop where they sold drapery , and the prisoner and his brother purchased six silk handkerchiefs and two pair of stockings ; saw the money paid , but ca n't say how much ; we then went to a beer shop kept by Lamb , and the prisoner purchased a gun there ; the price of it was two sovereigns , and he paid for it in sovereigns ; then the prisoner also purchased the jacket he has on and a waistcoat and hat ; he gave Â£ 1 for the coat ; the hat cost 9s . , and he paid for both . His brother is a miner . We then went home , and I had as much meat and drink as I pleased ; he paid for all . William CROCKER examined : I am a constable and farmer residing at Calstock ; in consequence of the robbery I went in search of the prisoner with a person named Crab , and saw him in a public house at Calstock town ; I told him that he was suspected of the robbery , as , the day before , he had had money lavishing pretty freely ; he said he had not committed any robbery ; he said nothing else to me ; I took him into custody ; I went out to look after my horse , and was absent about a quarter of an hour ; on my return , Crab said the prisoner had said "" this is the hand that got the money , and Trevan shall never have it . "" I do n't recollect that the prisoner said anything to that ; all he said to me was that he had not done it . William CRAB corroborated the testimony given by Mr. Crocker , swearing distinctly to the confession made by the prisoner in Mr. Crocker's absence . The witness underwent a long cross-examination , by Mr. John , relative to his pursuits in life , from which it appeared he had twice been in the London police , but he had both times obtained leave to quit the service . He had , since then , occupied himself occasionally at his trade as a woolstapler , and had otherwise whiled away his leisure as a bailiff's follower . These things Mr. John did not forget to comment upon in his address to the jury , but the Learned Chairman afterwards said that there was nothing dishonourable in any of these pursuits when properly followed , as appeared to be the case in the present instance . The last witness called was Susan MORGAN , the mother-in-law of the prisoner , who stated that on the 9th of May , the prisoner paid her 24s . which he had owed her for nearly twelve months . Mr. John having addressed the jury , the Chairman summed up , and the jury found the prisoner guilty of the larceny but not of house-breaking . The Court sentenced him to seven years' transportation . On hearing his sentence , the prisoner said , with great nonchalance , "" I 'd rather be transported for life than go home to my wife .

1195	"Take Action â Now ! If it 's going to be , it 's up to me In my clinical practice , I treat people who suffer from just about every imaginable emotional malady â depression , anxiety , anger , addictions , eating disorders , sexual malfunctions , obsessions and compulsions , borderline personality disorders , impulsive acting out , relationship dysfunction , and on and on . To every single one of my patients , I emphasize how important it is for them to step up to the plate and take responsibility for their recovery . How do I do this ? I first help them understand the precise nature and cause of their problems . Then , in the spirit of what the psychologist Carl Rogers taught , "" Insight is necessary but not sufficient , "" I do my best to convince them that , to get better , they need to work hard , really hard , not only during our sessions , but also in the days between our sessions . I tell them : "" The measly forty-five minutes you spend with me each week pales in comparison to the hours you spend with yourself , unwittingly rehearsing and practicing your irrational thinking and dysfunctional behavior . I 'll do everything in my power to teach you what to do , but , if you do n't work your therapy every day , you could very well come to our next appointment next week worse than better . "" In this vein , I make it a point to never let a patient leave my office without at least one between-session therapy assignment . It can be some therapeutic reading , a cognitive restructuring assignment , a behavioral task , or some combination of all three . It never fails that when patients works their therapy , every day , with vigor and focus , they get better . The same dedication to work applies to creating happiness .

If you do n't , it wo n't . It 's that simple . ACT So , dear reader , here 's your chance to get organized , get focused , and most important , get to work to increase your happiness quotient . I share below a three-step process I call ACT â A refers to creating your Action Plan for Happiness ; C has to do with your massive Commitment to do what it takes to bring more pleasure , satisfaction , and happiness into your life ; T means Turning On the Action . So , let 's swing into ACTion â now ! Action Plan For Happiness Starting way back on February 19 , 2013 , and then each month thereafter , I have published a series of thirty blogs , each with a profound , powerful happiness action strategy . The first ten focused on ways to be happy with yourself ( blogs 2 / 19 / 13 â 10 / 31 / 13 ) , the next ten on how to create happiness with others ( 11 / 30 / 13 â 8 / 31 / 14 ) , and the last ten on ways to be happy with life in general ( 9 / 30 / 14 â 6 / 30 / 15 ) . In each package of ten , the first five strategies are cognitive or attitudinal , the second five behavioral things to do . Whether you 've followed my blogs month-by-month , logged in here and there , or are a first-timer , I suggest that you take the time to browse through these blogs . This may take some time and energy on your part . But , I think your happiness is worth it , do n't you ? Once you 've done this , you are to select one strategy you will begin to do to be happier with yourself , with others , and with life . Write them down below . For each , make notes about where , when , and with whom you 'll act out these strategies . My Action Plan Happiness With Self Strategy : Happiness With Others Strategy : Happiness With Life Strategy : Commitment All right , great job ! You 've created a concrete happiness action plan that can add tons of pleasure and satisfaction to your life . But , all the plans in the world , without action , will be useless . You need to commit to follow through . Consider what the genius , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe : "" At the moment of commitment , the entire universe conspires to assist you . "" Here now are three ways for you to get and stay motivated to act out your Action Plan for Happiness each and every day . 1 . Benefits / Costs . Too often people focus on how difficult and cumbersome it is to do what is good for them . They tell themselves , "" It 's too hard , "" "" I do n't have the time , "" "" I 've got too much to do . "" Worse , they often also focus on the benefits of the short-range pleasure of lounging and doing nothing : "" I think I 'll just flip on the TV / read the newspaper while I sip coffee / kick up my feet and close my eyes . "" Unwittingly , this combination of focusing on the cost of action and on the pleasures of inaction demotivates them from acting to bring themselves long-range happiness . You want to reverse this by using costs and benefits to your advantage . What you want to do is focus both on the benefits of following through on your happiness action plan and the costs of inaction . If you keep clear about the benefits of doing and the costs of not doing , you strengthen your commitment to act . Now , take a few minutes to identify as many benefits to acting on your happiness action plan and as many costs as you to not acting . Remember : Your happiness may very well depend on your motivation . My Benefit / Cost Motivator The Profound Benefits of Happiness Action : The Profound Cost of Happiness Inaction : 2 . Rewards and Punishments . It is human nature to move toward pleasure and away from pain . The good news is that you can purposely use pleasure and pain to your advantage by rewarding yourself for acting on your action plan and punishing yourself for choosing not to act . Take a few minutes to do the exercise below . My Reward / Punishment Plan Reward : What do I have available every day that I enjoy ( e.g. , reading the newspaper , lounging in the hot tub , dessert ) that I will only allow myself to enjoy if I act on my Action Plan ? Punishment : What is something I dislike that I will use to punish myself for failing to act on my Action Plan ( e.g. , cleaning the bathroom , sending a $ 50 check to your least favorite political candidate , doing 25 push-ups ) ? 3 . Support . Athletes have coaches , creative writers have editors , politicians have advisers . These individuals recognize that it is next to impossible for them to create the results they 're after without a strong support system . The same goes for people like you and me who want to be happier in our lives . It is always helpful to have people who will commit themselves to supporting us to achieve our goals . Below , list three people you trust whom you will ask to support you on following through on your Action Plan for Happiness . What exactly will you ask them to do ? Turning On The Action The last and most important step is for you to act . Yes , act . Nothing ever happens without a person doing what is necessary to make it happen . Let me quote again from Goethe : "" Knowing is not enough ; we must apply . Willing is not enough ; we must do . "" So , now , right now , begin the process of integrating your Action Plan into the fabric of your life . To help you hold yourself accountable , I offer to you the following chart for you to record what you have done . Make fifty-two copies . Then , each week check off daily when you have acted on your plan . Going Forward I want to end this blog by quoting , one last time , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe . He said : "" Whatever you can do or dream you can , begin it . Boldness has genius , power and magic in it . "" There 's so much wisdom in that quote . But , to pare it down to its basics , it communicates in beautiful words what I 've preached throughout this blog : act , act boldly , because that , and only that , is the royal road to bring happiness into your life . Please , for you , not for me , begin to act on your Action Plan for Happiness , for your boldness has the power to magically change your life for the better . As always , know that I support you in your quest for Happiness on Purpose . Contact me at anytime by email and I will respond . Looking ahead , I will devote the next several blogs to teaching you how to bring more happiness into your relationship with your significant other . I look forward to it , as I hope you do . In the meantime , live healthy , happy , and with passion ."	Instruction
932	"Chapter indexed HTML of Villette , the novel by Charlotte Bronte ebooks of essential English literature free to read online sponsored external link to Lighting site II - Paulina Some days elapsed , and it appeared she was not likely to take much of a fancy to anybody in the house . She was not exactly naughty or wilful : she was far from disobedient ; but an object less conducive to comfort--to tranquillity even--than she presented , it was scarcely possible to have before one's eyes . She moped : no grown person could have performed that uncheering business better ; no furrowed face of adult exile , longing for Europe at Europe's antipodes , ever bore more legibly the signs of home sickness than did her infant visage . She seemed growing old and unearthly . I , Lucy Snowe , plead guiltless of that curse , an overheated and discursive imagination ; but whenever , opening a room-door , I found her seated in a corner alone , her head in her pigmy hand , that room seemed to me not inhabited , but haunted . And again , when of moonlight nights , on waking , I beheld her figure , white and conspicuous in its night-dress , kneeling upright in bed , and praying like some Catholic or Methodist enthusiast--some precocious fanatic or untimely saint--I scarcely know what thoughts I had ; but they ran risk of being hardly more rational and healthy than that child's mind must have been . I seldom caught a word of her prayers , for they were whispered low : sometimes , indeed , they were not whispered at all , but put up unuttered ; such rare sentences as reached my ear still bore the burden , "" Papa ; my dear papa ! "" This , I perceived , was a one-idea 'd nature ; betraying that monomaniac tendency I have ever thought the most unfortunate with which man or woman can be cursed . What might have been the end of this fretting , had it continued unchecked , can only be conjectured : it received , however , a sudden turn . One afternoon , Mrs. Bretton , coaxing her from her usual station in a corner , had lifted her into the window-seat , and , by way of occupying her attention , told her to watch the passengers and count how many ladies should go down the street in a given time . She had sat listlessly , hardly looking , and not counting , when--my eye being fixed on hers--I witnessed in its iris and pupil a startling transfiguration . These sudden , dangerous natures--_sensitive_ as they are called--offer many a curious spectacle to those whom a cooler temperament has secured from participation in their angular vagaries . The fixed and heavy gaze swum , trembled , then glittered in fire ; the small , overcast brow cleared ; the trivial and dejected features lit up ; the sad countenance vanished , and in its place appeared a sudden eagerness , an intense expectancy . "" It _is_ ! "" were her words . Like a bird or a shaft , or any other swift thing , she was gone from the room , How she got the house-door open I can not tell ; probably it might be ajar ; perhaps Warren was in the way and obeyed her behest , which would be impetuous enough . I--watching calmly from the window -- saw her , in her black frock and tiny braided apron ( to pinafores she had an antipathy ) , dart half the length of the street ; and , as I was on the point of turning , and quietly announcing to Mrs. Bretton that the child was run out mad , and ought instantly to be pursued , I saw her caught up , and rapt at once from my cool observation , and from the wondering stare of the passengers . A gentleman had done this good turn , and now , covering her with his cloak , advanced to restore her to the house whence he had seen her issue . I concluded he would leave her in a servant's charge and withdraw ; but he entered : having tarried a little while below , he came up-stairs . His reception immediately explained that he was known to Mrs. Bretton . She recognised him ; she greeted him , and yet she was fluttered , surprised , taken unawares . Her look and manner were even expostulatory ; and in reply to these , rather than her words , he said , -- "" I could not help it , madam : I found it impossible to leave the country without seeing with my own eyes how she settled . "" "" But you will unsettle her . "" "" I hope not . And how is papa's little Polly ? "" This question he addressed to Paulina , as he sat down and placed her gently on the ground before him . "" How is Polly's papa ? "" was the reply , as she leaned on his knee , and gazed up into his face . It was not a noisy , not a wordy scene : for that I was thankful ; but it was a scene of feeling too brimful , and which , because the cup did not foam up high or furiously overflow , only oppressed one the more . On all occasions of vehement , unrestrained expansion , a sense of disdain or ridicule comes to the weary spectator's relief ; whereas I have ever felt most burdensome that sort of sensibility which bends of its own will , a giant slave under the sway of good sense . Mr. Home was a stern-featured--perhaps I should rather say , a hard - featured man : his forehead was knotty , and his cheekbones were marked and prominent . The character of his face was quite Scotch ; but there was feeling in his eye , and emotion in his now agitated countenance . His northern accent in speaking harmonised with his physiognomy . He was at once proud-looking and homely-looking . He laid his hand on the child's uplifted head . She said -- "" Kiss Polly . "" He kissed her . I wished she would utter some hysterical cry , so that I might get relief and be at ease . She made wonderfully little noise : she seemed to have got what she wanted--_all_ she wanted , and to be in a trance of content . Neither in mien nor in features was this creature like her sire , and yet she was of his strain : her mind had been filled from his , as the cup from the flagon . Indisputably , Mr. Home owned manly self-control , however he might secretly feel on some matters . "" Polly , "" he said , looking down on his little girl , "" go into the hall ; you will see papa's great-coat lying on a chair ; put your hand into the pockets , you will find a pocket - handkerchief there ; bring it to me . "" She obeyed ; went and returned deftly and nimbly . He was talking to Mrs. Bretton when she came back , and she waited with the handkerchief in her hand . It was a picture , in its way , to see her , with her tiny stature , and trim , neat shape , standing at his knee . Seeing that he continued to talk , apparently unconscious of her return , she took his hand , opened the unresisting fingers , insinuated into them the handkerchief , and closed them upon it one by one . He still seemed not to see or to feel her ; but by-and-by , he lifted her to his knee ; she nestled against him , and though neither looked at nor spoke to the other for an hour following , I suppose both were satisfied . During tea , the minute thing's movements and behaviour gave , as usual , full occupation to the eye . First she directed Warren , as he placed the chairs . "" Put papa's chair here , and mine near it , between papa and Mrs. Bretton : _I_ must hand his tea . "" She took her own seat , and beckoned with her hand to her father . "" Be near me , as if we were at home , papa . "" And again , as she intercepted his cup in passing , and would stir the sugar , and put in the cream herself , "" I always did it for you at home ; papa : nobody could do it as well , not even your own self . "" Throughout the meal she continued her attentions : rather absurd they were . The sugar-tongs were too wide for one of her hands , and she had to use both in wielding them ; the weight of the silver cream-ewer , the bread-and-butter plates , the very cup and saucer , tasked her insufficient strength and dexterity ; but she would lift this , hand that , and luckily contrived through it all to break nothing . Candidly speaking , I thought her a little busy-body ; but her father , blind like other parents , seemed perfectly content to let her wait on him , and even wonderfully soothed by her offices . "" She is my comfort ! "" he could not help saying to Mrs. Bretton . That lady had her own "" comfort "" and nonpareil on a much larger scale , and , for the moment , absent ; so she sympathised with his foible . This second "" comfort "" came on the stage in the course of the evening . I knew this day had been fixed for his return , and was aware that Mrs. Bretton had been expecting him through all its hours . We were seated round the fire , after tea , when Graham joined our circle : I should rather say , broke it up--for , of course , his arrival made a bustle ; and then , as Mr. Graham was fasting , there was refreshment to be provided . He and Mr. Home met as old acquaintance ; of the little girl he took no notice for a time . His meal over , and numerous questions from his mother answered , he turned from the table to the hearth . Opposite where he had placed himself was seated Mr. Home , and at his elbow , the child . When I say _child_ I use an inappropriate and undescriptive term--a term suggesting any picture rather than that of the demure little person in a mourning frock and white chemisette , that might just have fitted a good-sized doll--perched now on a high chair beside a stand , whereon was her toy work-box of white varnished wood , and holding in her hands a shred of a handkerchief , which she was professing to hem , and at which she bored perseveringly with a needle , that in her fingers seemed almost a skewer , pricking herself ever and anon , marking the cambric with a track of minute red dots ; occasionally starting when the perverse weapon--swerving from her control--inflicted a deeper stab than usual ; but still silent , diligent , absorbed , womanly . Graham was at that time a handsome , faithless-looking youth of sixteen . I say faithless-looking , not because he was really of a very perfidious disposition , but because the epithet strikes me as proper to describe the fair , Celtic ( not Saxon ) character of his good looks ; his waved light auburn hair , his supple symmetry , his smile frequent , and destitute neither of fascination nor of subtlety ( in no bad sense ) . A spoiled , whimsical boy he was in those days . "" Mother , "" he said , after eyeing the little figure before him in silence for some time , and when the temporary absence of Mr. Home from the room relieved him from the half-laughing bashfulness , which was all he knew of timidity --- "" Mother , I see a young lady in the present society to whom I have not been introduced . "" "" Mr. Home's little girl , I suppose you mean , "" said his mother . "" Indeed , ma ' am , "" replied her son , "" I consider your expression of the least ceremonious : Miss Home _I_ should certainly have said , in venturing to speak of the gentlewoman to whom I allude . "" "" Now , Graham , I will not have that child teased . Do n't flatter yourself that I shall suffer you to make her your butt . "" "" Miss Home , "" pursued Graham , undeterred by his mother's remonstrance , "" might I have the honour to introduce myself , since no one else seems willing to render you and me that service ? Your slave , John Graham Bretton . "" She looked at him ; he rose and bowed quite gravely . She deliberately put down thimble , scissors , work ; descended with precaution from her perch , and curtsying with unspeakable seriousness , said , "" How do you do ? "" "" I have the honour to be in fair health , only in some measure fatigued with a hurried journey . I hope , ma ' am , I see you well ? "" "" Tor-rer-ably well , "" was the ambitious reply of the little woman and she now essayed to regain her former elevation , but finding this could not be done without some climbing and straining--a sacrifice of decorum not to be thought of--and being utterly disdainful of aid in the presence of a strange young gentleman , she relinquished the high chair for a low stool : towards that low stool Graham drew in his chair . "" I hope , ma ' am , the present residence , my mother's house , appears to you a convenient place of abode ? "" "" Not par-tic-er-er-ly ; I want to go home . "" "" A natural and laudable desire , ma ' am ; but one which , notwithstanding , I shall do my best to oppose . I reckon on being able to get out of you a little of that precious commodity called amusement , which mamma and Mistress Snowe there fail to yield me . "" "" I shall have to go with papa soon : I shall not stay long at your mother's . "" "" Yes , yes ; you will stay with me , I am sure . I have a pony on which you shall ride , and no end of books with pictures to show you . "" "" Are _you_ going to live here now ? "" "" I am . Does that please you ? Do you like me ? "" "" No. "" "" Why ? "" "" I think you queer . "" "" My face , ma ' am ? "" "" Your face and all about you : You have long red hair . "" "" Auburn hair , if you please : mamma , calls it auburn , or golden , and so do all her friends . But even with my ' long red hair ' "" ( and he waved his mane with a sort of triumph--tawny he himself well knew that it was , and he was proud of the leonine hue ) , "" I can not possibly be queerer than is your ladyship . "" "" You call me queer ? "" "" Certainly . "" ( After a pause ) , "" I think I shall go to bed . "" "" A little thing like you ought to have been in bed many hours since ; but you probably sat up in the expectation of seeing me ? "" "" No , indeed . "" "" You certainly wished to enjoy the pleasure of my society . You knew I was coming home , and would wait to have a look at me . "" "" I sat up for papa , and not for you . "" "" Very good , Miss Home . I am going to be a favourite : preferred before papa soon , I daresay . "" She wished Mrs. Bretton and myself good-night ; she seemed hesitating whether Graham's deserts entitled him to the same attention , when he caught her up with one hand , and with that one hand held her poised aloft above his head . She saw herself thus lifted up on high , in the glass over the fireplace . The suddenness , the freedom , the disrespect of the action were too much . "" For shame , Mr. Graham ! "" was her indignant cry , "" put me down ! "" -- and when again on her feet , "" I wonder what you would think of me if I were to treat you in that way , lifting you with my hand "" ( raising that mighty member ) "" as Warren lifts the little cat . "" So saying , she departed ."	Prose/Lyrical
1350	"Domestic Violence - A Workplace Issue She was one of the top customer service reps in the company . To her coworkers , Suzanne seemed to have it all - a doting husband , children , a lovely home and a successful career . Every night at the end of her shift , her husband was waiting outside in their car for her , and she was out the door promptly at five . One day her manager approached her just before quitting time and asked to speak with her in his office . She became flustered and asked if it could n't wait until the next day . He shrugged her off . "" It 'll only take a few minutes . I wo n't keep you long . "" He was true to his word but when Suzanne opened the door to leave her manager's office , her fuming husband was standing there . He ordered her to go to the car . What Suzanne's colleagues did n't know was that she spent the following two days being insulted , assaulted and locked in her own bedroom , all at the hands of her "" devoted "" husband . What is domestic violence ? Domestic violence ( also called battering or intimate partner violence ) is a pattern of abusive behaviour used by a person to gain power and control over his or her partner in an intimate relationship . The abusive behaviour can include intimidation , verbal abuse , emotional attacks , threats or use of violence , sexual assault , and homicide . The batterer may also use other means to control his or her victim , such as controlling finances , interfering in the victim's work , isolation , limited or no communication , blaming , apologies , promises to change and gifts . Victims of domestic violence come from all walks of life , however the majority are women . The SafeWork website reports that in the United States , 1 in 3 women will report being physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives . Domestic violence tends to become more severe over time with the highest number of assaults and homicides occurring after victims leave their abusive partners . So why is domestic violence a workplace issue ? When a victim leaves the abusive relationship , the abuser knows that the one place the victim can be found is at work . Ten signs of domestic violence If you suspect that one of your employees or colleagues may be in an abusive relationship , look for a pattern of these signs : Injuries such as bruises , black eyes , or broken bones with no , or unlikely explanations such as blaming the injuries on falls or being clumsy Large number of phone calls , emails , and texts from a current or former partner and reluctance to respond to them Disruptive visits to work by current or former partner What employers can do As an employer , you have the power to keep your employees safe at work . Ultimately , this will also protect your community as well as your company's bottom line . You can start by developing a domestic violence policy . You can also train your managers , supervisors and all employees about proper response steps , and raise awareness about the issue . Train managers and supervisors to : recognize - be aware of signs of violence for potential victims and abusers refer - know who to call internally and externally if a situation of domestic violence becomes known Training should include issues of privacy and confidentiality . Start a program in your workplace to address domestic violence : Make prevention of and response to domestic violence part of your workplace violence prevention program . Create awareness by talking about domestic violence with your employees . Communicate that your workplace is a safe environment for them to reach out for help with domestic violence . Provide employees with information on how to recognize the signs of a troublesome or abusive relationship so they know when to seek assistance for themselves or for co-workers . Make information on counseling and support resources available both inside and outside the organization . Educate employees regarding security procedures available to keep themselves and others safe in the workplace , including where and how to report a potential threat and how to avoid unintentionally giving the abuser access to the victim . remove the employee's name and phone number from automated phone messages or directories ; do n't give out any employee's personal information to others ; ensure the employee knows the specifics of your workplace policy and how to report any incident or threat ; rework the employee's work assignment or schedule . Develop an effective workplace response to domestic violence that includes an organizational safety plan as well as working with victims to develop individualized workplace safety plans . Domestic violence is a workplace issue . In April 2009 Ontario tabled Bill 168 , an act to amend the Occupational Health and Safety Act . The proposed bill specifically addressed the issue of domestic violence in the workplace by requiring Ontario employers to "" take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances "" to protect workers from domestic violence that would likely cause physical injury to workers in the workplace . This obligation on the employer arises only if the employer is - or should be - aware of the situation . What constitutes "" domestic violence "" is not defined . The new legislation is expected to be passed in the Fall 2009 . Hazard Alerts Print this article Lead in the Workplace Last year , some childhood lead poisonings in Maine came from an unusual source . Parents got lead dust on their clothes at work and then carried it into their cars , inadvertently exposing their children . Workers can be exposed to lead in the workplace by inhaling fumes and dusts , or by accidentally ingesting it from lead-contaminated hands , food , drinks , cosmetics , tobacco products , and clothing . As in the case of the family in Maine , workers can take lead home on their clothes , skin , hair , tools , and in their vehicles , potentially exposing their families to harmful health effects . In an updated health and safety bulletin , Work Safe Alberta offers guidance on lead in the workplace and how to protect workers and their families from lead exposure . Lead exposure Until the 1980s , the main sources of lead exposure for Canadians were lead paint and emissions from cars using leaded gasoline ( which stopped in Canada in 1990 , except for some specific types of vehicles ) . Today lead is used in many of the following products : batteries lead shielding for x-rays crystal ceramics and pottery glazes stained glass lead solder - used in water pipes in older homes , electronics , radiator shops cosmetics - many of the pigments and other substances used in cosmetics contain lead pesticides ( lead arsenate ) ammunition lead weights and tools electroplating glass in computer monitors Occupations with lead exposure risks include : Cable splicing Construction Manufacturing of ammunition , ceramics , electrical components , pottery and lead batteries Stained glass Mining Painting Radiator repair Recovery of gold and silver Repair and reclamation of lead batteries Smelting Welding Health effects The most common ways that workers are exposed to lead are inhalation of airborne lead dust or fumes and accidental ingestion . Workers ingest lead by touching the face and handling cigarettes or food when their hands are contaminated with lead . About 5 to 15 percent of the lead an adult ingests is absorbed into their body . Lead is not normally absorbed through the skin unless there is a break in the skin such as a cut or scrape . Symptoms of acute lead poisoning include headache , excessive tiredness , nausea , abdominal cramps , and joint pain . Other effects such as a metallic taste in the mouth , vomiting and constipation or bloody diarrhea can also occur . Harmful effects due to short-term exposure to inorganic lead compounds are rarely seen any more because of strict controls used in workplaces where lead exposure might occur . However , lead accumulates in the body where it can be stored for decades and released back into the blood long after the original exposure . Inorganic lead compounds are well known to cause significant health effects following long-term ( chronic ) exposure , including effects on the : Reproductive system ( causing effects on fertility and developmental effects in children ) Nervous system Digestive system Cardiovascular and blood system Kidneys Work Safe Alberta's health and safety bulletin provides greater detail on the health effects as well as information on managing lead in the workplace , exposure levels , monitoring methods , and preventive measures .

If you 're new at this game it will pay you to be bit careful with how you proceed at first . For instance , when dealing with old furniture do n't just assume that you need to strip away the battered old surface . In many cases this is just not necessary . Many of those early finishes such as shellac and varnish can be restored beautifully , unlike modern laminates or urethaned surfaces . Even pieces that have to be stripped because they 've been painted over can still be brought back to life without having to attempt a French polish job which may end in disaster . There is a product on the market called Restor-A-Finish which can do amazing some might even say , unbelievable things . All you need apart from a tin of Restor-A-Finish is some 0000 grade steel wool and some clean cloth . If your piece of furniture was polished years ago using shellac or varnish , your job is likely to be pretty easy and very rewarding . How do you tell ? A rule of thumb is that anything manufactured before 1960 will have been finished in a fairly traditional manner and not with a polyurethane type material .

204	"re document forming part of the reports of states parties latvia [ 26 February 2002 ] Paragraphs Page General information The Republic of Latvia is an independent and democratic State situated in north-eastern Europe on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea covering 64,589 square kilometres . The State borders with the Republic of Estonia in the north , with the Republic of Lithuania in the south and with the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation in the east . The landscape of the country is marked by lowland plains and rolling hills and most of the countryside is less than 100 metres above sea level . The country historically and culturally is divided into four regions : Kurzeme , Latgale , Zemgale and Vidzeme . There are 7 cities , 69 towns , 26 districts and 483 local municipalities in Latvia . The capital of the Republic of Latvia is Riga . The official language of the State is Latvian , which is one of the oldest of the Indo-European languages and is spoken by approximately 70-75 per cent of the population . The national currency is the lats ( LVL ) , officially pegged to the SDR ( Special Drawing Rights ) basket of currencies at the rate of 0.7997 SDR / LVL . The table below represents the basic statistical data on the characteristics of the Latvian population for the year 2000 / 01 . Table ( continued ) Demographic characteristics In year 2000 the population census was held throughout the country . There were 2,375,000 inhabitants , approximately 1,093,000 males and 1,282,000 females , permanently residing in the territory of Latvia . At the beginning of the year 2001 408,700 Latvians were under 15 , 1,448,400 aged from 15 to 59 and 509,000 aged 60 and over . According to the previous population census held in 1989 , the percentage of the population under 15 fell from 21.4 per cent to 17.3 per cent but the percentage of the population aged 60 years and over increased from 17.4 per cent to 21.5 per cent . The overall decline in the State's population since 1996 is given below . ( Population figures have been revised on the basis of the results of the 2000 population census . As a consequence of tremendous political and socio-economic changes in the State since 1991 , the natural population growth has been negative . However , in 1999 the natural growth slowly improved . In 1999 , the number of children born in comparison with 1998 increased by 5.4 per cent . Furthermore , in 2000 the death rate per 100,000 residents was 1,357 - slightly lower than in 1999 . The natural population growth is given below . The death rate of newborns has decreased from 15.8 per 1,000 in 1996 to 10.4 per 1,000 in 2000 . The number of cases of maternal death per 100,000 babies born alive had decreased from 40.4 in 1996 to 24.8 in 2000 . The Government has taken appropriate measures to improve the demographic situation ; thus , the Ministry of Welfare elaborated and the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia in February 2001 adopted "" The Strategy of Health Care of Mother and Child in Latvia "" . Ethnic characteristics During the 1990s the proportion of ethnic Latvians slightly increased while the proportion of Russians , Byelorussians , Ukrainians , Poles and other ethnic groups decreased . During 2000 the number of Latvians was also slightly higher , compared with other national groups living in Latvia . The distribution of Latvia's population by ethnic origin between 1935 and 2001 is shown in the table below . Long-term historical cohabitation and friendly relations among different ethnic groups have made Latvia a place where significant conflicts among various ethnic and religious groups have not been possible . After regaining independence , the Government elaborated a policy to accommodate its various groups and their many cultural and religious traditions . The model which was chosen could be called "" a national State with a multicultural society "" : national in the sense that a condition of integration is one official State language and a unified territory , and multicultural in the sense that there is no common or State-supported religion and there are schools with different languages of instruction and conditions promoting development of all cultures . Since 1999 the State Programme of Integration of Society has been carried out and a special institution - the Fund for the Integration of the Society - is in the process of formation . The goals of the programme are to form a democratic , consolidated civil society founded on shared basic values , to provide for all people permanently residing in Latvia access to contemporary living standards , and to promote welfare , education , security and favourable relations between the various ethnic groups . Economic indicators Latvia has made significant advances in its economic , financial and social development since regaining its independence in 1990 , and has embraced comprehensive market economy reform . During the last several years , Government agreed on and continued the structural reform of the economy by accelerating privatization , strengthening the banking sector and the financial system in general , and stabilizing the overall situation in industry and agriculture . GDP growth has been based on a broad range of developments . Particularly strong advances have been made during the last decade in the transportation and financial sectors , in communication services and commerce . Since the beginning of the transition to a market economy , the Government has implemented a strict fiscal policy through a major revenue mobilization combined with expenditure restraint . Latvia has made substantial progress in establishing the State institutions needed for fiscal management in a market economy . Consistently tight monetary and successful financial policies have been reflected in the continuous fall of inflation from 958.6 per cent in 1992 to 23.1 per cent in 1995 , 13.1 per cent in 1996 and 7.0 per cent in 1997 . In 1998 the annual inflation rate fell to 2.8 per cent , in 1999 the annual inflation rate was at 3.2 per cent and in 2000 it was 1.8 per cent . The table below shows the key indicators of economic development of the State ( the data for 2001 are estimates ) . Table ( continued ) The unemployment rate since 1998 has been decreasing slightly , although the rate is still relatively high . In order to address this issue , the National Employment Plan is elaborated annually . The main aims of the Plan are to prevent young unemployed people from becoming long-term unemployed ; to eliminate barriers to business and restrictions to starting entrepreneurial activity ; to strengthen cooperation between the Confederation of Employers and the Confederation of Free Trade Unions ; to implement measures aimed at ensuring equal opportunities for women and men in the labour market ; to reduce gender inequality in the area of employment and revenues ; and to encourage family-friendly social and labour policies . The basic detailed unemployment data in Latvia are the following : The gross wage earned by people employed in the national economy in 2000 grew on average by 6.1 per cent in comparison with the preceding year and reached almost 150 lats . The table below indicates the income of residents of the Republic of Latvia . The Government recognizes that notwithstanding the country's substantial development and economic growth , the polarization of the society still continues . The results of the household budget surveys show that average household income per person is increasing , but simultaneously the income of the poorest members of society is decreasing even more . ii . political structure Historical background Historically , the territory of Latvia has always been regarded as a trading and transportation crossroads and has long served as a bridge between Western Europe and Russia . The ancestors of the Latvian nation settled on Latvian soil more than 4,000 years ago . Today Latvia has a multi-ethnic society and culture that has developed because of the historical , economic and social evolution of the country , providing good possibilities for using Latvia as a stable location to work in the Eastern and Western markets . The Republic of Latvia as a national State was proclaimed on 18 November 1918 in accordance with the principles of international law , and since then its de iure legal personality has never been interrupted . Latvia was granted international recognition in 1920 and became a member of the League of Nations in 1921 . It has been continuously recognized as a State by other countries since 1920 despite occupations by the Soviet Union ( 1940-1941 , 1945-1991 ) and Nazi Germany ( 1941-1945 ) . The will and the right to self-determination of the people of Latvia was expressed in April 1920 when the people of Latvia gave their mandate to the Constitutional Assembly chosen in universal , equal , direct and proportional elections . The nation was united by the Latvian Provisional Government and on 11 August 1920 a peace treaty with Russia was signed in which Russia recognized Latvia's independence . In February 1922 , the Assembly adopted the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia , which is still in force with some amendments , among them chapter VIII on Fundamental Human Rights , adopted in 1998 . Until 1940 , Latvia witnessed impressive economic growth , a flourishing cultural life and a marked improvement in its standard of living . To guarantee the State's economic and social stability , the Government of Latvia launched a programme of agrarian reform . Latvian culture was encouraged and ethnic minorities , which comprised around 25 per cent of the population , were granted educational rights . The ultimatum of 16 June 1940 from the Government of the Soviet Union to the Latvian Government , asking for its resignation , and the ensuing military aggression , resulted in the occupation of Latvia . The elections of 14 and 15 July 1940 of the Parliament ( Saeima ) of occupied Latvia were held under conditions of political terror after an illegal and unconstitutional elections law had been adopted . Of the 17 lists of candidates submitted , only one was permitted in the elections - the list of the Working People's Bloc . The pre-election platform of the Bloc did not include any demand to establish Soviet power in Latvia or to join the Soviet Union . Furthermore , the results of the elections were falsified . The illegally and fraudulently formed Parliament did not represent the will of the Latvian people . It had no constitutional powers to change the system of government and bring to an end the sovereignty of Latvia . Only the people had the right to decide these matters , but no referendum was held . The incorporation of Latvia into the Soviet Union in 1940 is considered to be invalid also in accordance with international law . The will of the people of Latvia for freedom was expressed in the elections of the Latvian Supreme Council in 1990 of which a majority afterwards expressed the determination to restore the independence of Latvia . The Declaration of the Supreme Council of the Latvian SSR "" On the Renewal of the Independence of the Republic of Latvia "" was adopted on 4 May 1990 . Being determined to restore de facto the free , democratic and independent Republic of Latvia , the Supreme Council of the Latvian SSR on that date declared illegal the joining of Latvia to the Soviet Union . Furthermore , it decided to re-establish the authority of the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia , adopted by the Constitutional Assembly on 15 February 1922 , in the entire territory of Latvia . On 17 September 1991 Latvia became a full-fledged member of the United Nations . Since 1995 it has been a member State of the Council of Europe . On 12 June 1995 , an Association Agreement was signed with the European Community and its member States , which came into force in February 1998 . Political framework The legislative power is granted to the Saeima ( Parliament ) as well as to the people to the extent provided for by the Satversme ( Constitution ) . Furthermore , the Saeima approves the appointment of the judges of courts of all levels and declares amnesties . It consists of 100 Saeima members elected in general , direct , secret and proportional elections . The Saeima is elected for a period of four years . The Saeima elects the President of the State for a period of four years and the same person can not hold the office of President of the State for more than two consecutive terms . The President of the State fulfils rather representative functions , however , it is the President of the State who nominates the Head of the Government - the Prime Minister . The Prime Minister forms the Government ( the Cabinet of Ministers ) - the executive power of the State - and receives the confidence of the Saeima ( Parliament ) . Latvia has a three-level court system - district / city courts , regional courts and the Supreme Court . The establishment of the Satversme Court ( Constitutional Court ) in 1996 completed the judicial reform in Latvia . The Public Prosecutor's Office , the Collegium of Sworn Advocates and the Collegium of Notaries are the indispensable elements of the judicial system of the Republic of Latvia . iii . general legal framework within which human rights are protected Article 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia ( Satversme ) provides that Latvia is an independent democratic republic . This principle sets forth certain exact requirements for the Latvian legal system , which also influence the implementation of the obligations under the international human rights instruments . On 4 May 1990 the Supreme Council of the Soviet Republic of Latvia being concerned about the compliance of national law with international law principles in the sphere of human rights , adopted the Declaration on Accession to International Acts of Human Rights . By the Declaration Latvia acceded to 51 international documents ( declarations and conventions ) , inter alia the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . The Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights entered into force on 22 September 1994 ; thus , the Republic of Latvia recognizes the competence of the Human Rights Committee to receive and consider communications from individuals who claim to be victims of a violation by the State of the human rights set forth in the Covenant . Moreover , on 27 June 1997 the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 4 November 1950 entered into force in the Republic of Latvia . Thus , Latvia has accepted the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights and accordingly an individual may complain about a violation of his / her rights provided for by the European Convention directly to the Court . In October 1998 , the Constitution of Latvia ( Satversme ) was amended and chapter VIII on Fundamental Human Rights was included . The adoption of these amendments clarified the debate concerning the role and legal status of human rights in the State's legal system . It also added a more concrete understanding to the principle of democracy , as embodied in article 1 of the Satversme . Accordingly , article 89 states : "" The State shall recognize and protect fundamental human rights in accordance with the present Constitution , laws and international agreements binding upon Latvia . "" Article 91 of the Constitution encompasses both the principle of equality and the principle of non-discrimination . This article states : "" All human beings in Latvia shall be equal before the law and the courts . Human rights shall be secured without discrimination of any kind . "" Other newly included articles of the Constitution list fundamental human rights guaranteed by the State and also provide for possible restrictions on the exercise of these rights imposed by the State . International human rights treaties are directly applicable in the domestic legal system . They override norms of statutory law in case of a conflict of norms . It should be emphasized that international human rights norms are understood to have special status in relation to statutory laws because of their special aim and object and a direct link to the principle of democracy as embodied in Satversme . Thus , Satversme and international human rights treaties binding for Latvia provide for the catalogue of human rights and freedoms in the State . Regarding the institutional protection of human rights , the independent judiciary and the administrative process are the key elements . The courts are the main judicial institutions having jurisdiction over issues of respect and observance of human rights . According to the Law on the Judicial Power Latvia has a three-level court system . The district / city courts try civil , criminal and administrative cases ; they function mostly as courts of first instance . There are regional courts in each of the regions of Latvia and in the capital , Riga , that try those civil and criminal cases that fall within their authority under the Law on Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure ; regional courts are also the courts of appeal for those cases that have been tried by district / city courts . The Supreme Court is the court of appeal and cassation for all cases tried by regional courts and district / city courts . The Supreme Court acts also as the first instance court for several cases according to the Law on the Judicial Branch . According to article 3 of the Law on the Judicial Branch every individual has the right to be protected by the court against infringements upon his / her life , health , personal freedom , honour , reputation and property . All individuals have equal rights to have their case heard fairly and publicly by an independent and impartial court , which determines his / her civil rights and obligations , or the validity of any criminal charge against him / her . Article 4 of the above-mentioned Law states that all individuals are equal before the law and the court , and have an equal right to be protected by law . Justice is administered by the court irrespective of the person's origin , social status and property , race and nationality , sex , education , language , religious affiliation , type and nature of occupation , place of residence , and political or other views . According to article 17 of the Law on the Constitutional Court ( Satversme Court ) individuals whose fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution have been violated have the right to "" submit an application to initiate a case regarding compliance of laws and international agreements signed or entered into by Latvia - even before the Saeima has confirmed the agreement - with the Constitution ; compliance of other normative acts or their parts with the legal norms ( acts ) of higher legal force ; as well as compliance of national legal norms of Latvia with international agreements entered into by Latvia which are not contrary to the Constitution "" . In 1995 , the Regulations on the Process of Administrative Acts of the Cabinet of Ministers were adopted , establishing the procedure by which individuals may ask for , or complain about , or appeal against an administrative act adopted by a public institution . There are two main situations where an individual may appeal before the court against an administrative act : when the administrative act violates his / her rights provided in the Constitution of Latvia , international human rights instruments binding on Latvia or a statutory law ; or when the procedure governing the adoption of an administrative act has been abused . The law on the Prosecutor's Office and the Law "" On the Police "" provide that the Prosecutor's Office and the police also protect individuals against infringements upon their life , health , personal freedom , honour , reputation and property . According to the Law "" On the Repayment of Damages or Losses Caused by Unlawful or Unfounded Acts of Investigators , the Prosecutor's Office or the Court "" , material compensation is paid to individuals who have suffered from unlawful or unfounded acts by State officials . Furthermore , the State Human Rights Office , the independent national institution , has a duty to review any claim of infringement of human rights in Latvia and immediately react on a violation of an individual's rights , and on its own initiative , to investigate . iv . information and publicity Whenever the Republic of Latvia concludes an international agreement , the text of the agreement is translated into Latvian and published in the official newspaper , Latvijas VÄstnesis . In addition , the text in the original language of the agreement is published as well ( usually in English ) . This procedure applies also to international human rights instruments . Furthermore , the State institutions have access to the normative acts and international treaties and conventions in force in Latvia in the electronic database of the State . In addition , information on various international human rights instruments have been published in booklets by the State Human Rights Office . UNDP , UNHCR , UNESCO and UNICEF have opened representative offices that are functioning , with good results , in Latvia . Publications about human right issues have appeared and have been made available to any member of the society : "" Guidebook of Human Rights Tolerance "" , "" Human Rights Album "" ( published by the European Union ) , "" Concise Explanation of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights "" and others . Booklets on the rights of the child have been published and distributed by the Children Rights Protection Centre . The Latvian Human Rights Institute , which is the independent section of the State University quarterly , publishes a legal journal - Latvian Human Rights Quarterly - which contains articles on human rights issues in Latvia and abroad , international treaties and national laws , decisions of the European Court of Human Rights as well as of national courts concerning violations of human rights , as well as information on various activities ( conferences , seminars , courses on human rights ) provided by the Latvian Human Rights Institute or other institutions in Latvia . The national reports on the implementation of the human rights conventions in Latvia are prepared by working groups consisting of representatives of ministries and other State institutions and headed by the Representative of the Government before International Human Rights Organizations . Although the publication of reports is not required in national legislation , the practice to do so is developing . As a result of the cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Latvian Human Rights Institute , the report and debate concerning the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was published in the Official Gazette and the Latvian Human Rights Quarterly . The Views of the Human Rights Committee on individual applications concerning possible violations of the Covenant were also published in the Official Gazette .

238	"Regulations Governing the Status , Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials , and Experts on Mission United Nations New York , 2002 ST / SGB / 2002 / 9 18 June 2002 Secretary-General's bulletin Regulations Governing the Status , Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials , and Experts on Mission The Secretary-General promulgates the following Regulations Governing the Status , Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials , and Experts on Mission ( hereinafter "" the Regulations "" ) . Section 1 General provisions 1.1 By its resolution 56 / 280 of 27 March 2002 , the General Assembly adopted the Regulations . 1.2 The text of the Regulations is attached to the present bulletin . Section 2 Final provision The present bulletin shall enter into force on 1 July 2002 . ( Signed ) Kofi A. Annan Secretary-General Contents Introduction Article 105 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations empowers the General Assembly to make recommendations with a view to determining , inter alia , the privileges and immunities of officials of the Organization or to propose conventions to Member States for this purpose . The Assembly did so by adopting the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations on 13 February 1946 ( hereinafter called "" the General Convention "" ) . The United Nations has persons performing full-time services for it , at the direction of its legislative organs , who are not staff . For example , article 13 of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit ( approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 31 / 192 of 22 December 1976 ) provides that the Inspectors shall have the status of officials of the Organization but shall not be staff members . In addition , pursuant to article V , section 17 , of the General Convention , the Secretary-General has specified and submitted to the Assembly proposals that a number of persons who occupy certain positions within the Organization be accorded privileges and immunities under articles V and VII of the General Convention , even though they are not staff members . Those persons are the presiding officers of United Nations organs performing functions for the Organization on a substantially full-time basis ( for example , the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the International Civil Service Commission ) . Those officials are not in a separate category under the General Convention , but their names are submitted by the Secretary-General to the host country together with those of Secretariat officials who are staff members . These persons have been consistently referred to by the General Assembly as "" officials other than Secretariat officials "" . Experts on mission may be retained by way of a contract known as a consultant contract , which sets out the terms of their appointment and the tasks that they must discharge . Other individuals may have the status of experts on mission , even though they do not sign a consultant contract , if they are designated by United Nations organs to carry out missions or functions for the United Nations ( for example , rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights , rapporteurs and members of its Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and members of the International Law Commission ) . Article VI of the General Convention provides that experts ( other than officials coming within the scope of article V ) shall be accorded privileges and immunities necessary to enable them to carry out their missions for the United Nations and specifies a number of those privileges and immunities . Article VII , section 26 , of the General Convention provides that facilities similar to those specified in section 25 ( concerning applications for visas and facilities for speedy travel ) shall be accorded to experts and other persons who are travelling on the business of the United Nations . The Regulations contained in the present bulletin will apply to officials other than Secretariat officials , and to experts on mission . The Regulations are in most parts very general since they must apply to all officials other than Secretariat officials , and experts on mission . However , the application of the Regulations and the commentary to officials other than Secretariat officials , and to experts on mission who perform functions in respect of the United Nations and other organizations in the common system in accordance with their mandates ( e . g . , the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the International Civil Service Commission and the Inspectors of the Joint Inspection Unit ) , is explained in various provisions of the Regulations and the commentary ( see , e . g . , regulation 1 ( f ) , paragraph 3 of the commentary to regulation 1 ( a ) and the commentary to Regulation 1 ( b )) . The Regulations contained in the present bulletin will form part of the contract of employment or terms of appointment of any individual , including officials other than Secretariat officials , and experts on mission , who are appointed through Assembly action or through the actions of other representative bodies . Role of the commentary Each provision of the Regulations set out in the present bulletin is followed by a commentary . The commentary is designed to explain those provisions and will thus be of help to those persons subject to the Regulations . The commentary is not part of the Regulations adopted by the Assembly , and so is not a legal norm ; nor does it have the legal force of a rule . It is , however , an official guide published by the Secretary-General on the scope and application of the Regulations .

( e ) The privileges and immunities enjoyed by the United Nations by virtue of Article 105 of its Charter are conferred in the interests of the Organization .

In any case where an issue arises regarding the application of these privileges and immunities , an official or an expert on mission shall immediately report the matter to the Secretary-General , who alone may decide whether such privileges and immunities exist and whether they shall be waived , in accordance with the relevant instruments .

( f ) Officials and experts on mission shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters of official business . Officials and experts on mission shall not communicate to any Government , entity , person or any other source any information known to them by reason of their official position that they know or ought to have known has not been made public , except as appropriate in the normal course of their duties or by authorization of the Secretary-General . If they are not appointed by the Secretary-General , such authorization shall be conferred by the body that appointed them . These obligations do not cease upon the cessation of their official functions . ( g ) Officials and experts on mission may not accept any honour , decoration , favour , gift or remuneration from any Government or non-governmental source for activities carried out during the course of their official functions while in the service of the United Nations . ( h ) Officials and experts on mission shall not be actively associated with the management of , or hold a financial interest in , any profit-making , business or other concern , if it were possible for them or the profit-making , business or other concern to benefit from such association or financial interest by reason of their position with the United Nations . Officials or experts on mission who are in such a situation shall either dispose of that financial interest or formally excuse themselves from participating with regard to any involvement in that matter that has given rise to the conflict-of-interest situation . ( i ) Officials and experts on mission shall file financial disclosure statements if requested to do so by the Secretary-General . The Secretary-General shall prescribe the format and information to be provided in such statements and shall establish procedures for filing them . The financial disclosure statements will remain confidential and will be used , as prescribed by the Secretary-General , only in making determinations pursuant to regulation 2 ( h ) . It will be for the Secretary-General , in due consultation with the appointing authority in the case of officials not appointed by the Secretary-General , to judge whether a particular fact has given rise to a conflict-of-interest situation . ( j ) Officials and experts on mission must comply with local laws and honour their private legal obligations , including , but not limited to , the obligation to honour orders of competent courts .

In such cases , the travel and subsistence allowance that may otherwise be payable by the United Nations shall be reduced in the same manner as in respect of staff members of the Organization . Regulation 3 Accountability Officials and experts on mission are accountable to the United Nations for the proper discharge of their functions . Regulations Governing the Status , Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials , and Experts on Mission , with commentary Regulation 1 Status Regulation 1 ( a ) The responsibilities of officials other than Secretariat officials ( hereinafter referred to as "" officials "" ) and of experts on mission are not national but exclusively international . Commentary The United Nations has persons who perform services for it on a substantially full-time basis but who are not staff members . These persons have consistently been referred to by the General Assembly as "" officials other than Secretariat officials "" . In addition , pursuant to article V , section 17 , of the General Convention , the Secretary-General has specified and submitted to the Assembly proposals that a number of persons who occupy certain positions within the Organization be accorded the privileges and immunities under articles V and VII of the General Convention , even though they are not staff members . These persons have also been referred to as "" officials other than Secretariat officials "" . The United Nations also has experts who perform assignments for the Organization . Article VI of the General Convention provides that experts ( other than officials coming within the scope of article V ) shall be accorded privileges and immunities necessary to enable them to carry out their missions for the United Nations and specifies a number of those privileges and immunities . These experts have been referred to as "" experts on mission "" . The Regulations and the commentary , as applied to the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the International Civil Service Commission , the Inspectors of the Joint Inspection Unit and other officials and experts who perform functions in respect of the common system , in accordance with the statute of the International Civil Service Commission or that of the Joint Inspection Unit , respectively , or other mandates approved by the General Assembly or other relevant main bodies and organs of the United Nations , should be construed in the light of those functions and mandates . References to the United Nations or the United Nations Organization in the context of these Regulations and the commentary should be applied , bearing in mind that the functions of those officials and experts are related to the common system . Regulation 1 ( a ) is similar to the second sentence of staff regulation 1.1 ( a ) . Regulation 1 ( b ) Officials and experts on mission shall make the following written declaration witnessed by the Secretary-General or an authorized representative : "" I solemnly declare and promise to exercise in all loyalty , discretion and conscience the functions entrusted to me by the United Nations , to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the interests of the United Nations only in view , and not to seek or accept instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government or other source external to the Organization . "" Commentary Regulation 1 ( b ) , which is similar to staff regulation 1.1 ( b ) , contains the declaration of office of officials and experts on mission . In view of the system-wide functions of the International Civil Service Commission and the Joint Inspection Unit , the term "" United Nations "" in the written declaration will be replaced by the words "" United Nations and other participating organizations "" , and the word "" Organization "" will be replaced by the word "" organizations "" in the case of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the International Civil Service Commission and the Inspectors of the Joint Inspection Unit . Regulation 1 ( c ) The Secretary-General shall seek to ensure that the rights and duties of officials and experts on mission , as set out in the General Convention , are respected . The Secretary-General shall also seek to ensure , having regard to the circumstances , that all necessary safety and security arrangements are made for officials and experts on mission carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to them . Commentary The first sentence of regulation 1 ( c ) , which is similar to staff regulation 1.1 ( c ) , codifies an implicit duty that falls upon the Secretary-General , namely , to seek to ensure that the rights and duties of officials and experts on mission as set out in the General Convention are respected ( as such rights are granted by Governments , the Secretary-General can only "" seek to ensure "" that they are respected ) . The protection accorded to officials and experts on mission under this provision relates to their official acts and thus does not lapse upon cessation of their service for the Organization , or , if they are part-time , on days when they are not in service . The second sentence of regulation 1 ( c ) , which reproduces the essence of the second sentence of staff regulation 1.2 ( c ) , sets forth the responsibility of the Secretary-General to seek to ensure the safety of officials and experts on mission . Regulation 1 ( d ) Experts on mission will receive a copy of the present Regulations Governing the Status , Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials and Experts on Mission ( hereinafter referred to as "" the Regulations "" ) when they receive documentation from the United Nations relating to their mission and will be required to acknowledge receipt of the Regulations . Officials will receive a copy of the Regulations at an appropriate opportunity . Commentary Experts on mission retained by the Secretariat sign a consultant contract or receive a letter or other documentation indicating the scope of their mission for the Organization . The consultant contract or other documentation will incorporate the Regulations by reference , and experts will be required to acknowledge that they will abide by the Regulations . At times , legislative bodies entrust tasks to individuals to perform assignments for those bodies ( for example , members and special rapporteurs of the International Law Commission and other bodies ) . Those individuals have the status of experts on mission . Although their appointments may have been concluded without the signature of any document of appointment , their attention will be drawn to the Regulations when they receive documentation from the Secretariat relating to their functions and / or their assignment . That documentation will include a copy of the Regulations explaining that they were adopted by the General Assembly and thus constitute part of the conditions of those individuals' assignment for the United Nations . Officials will receive a copy of the Regulations at an appropriate time , such as when they make the declaration of office ( see regulation 1 ( b )) . Regulation 1 ( e ) The privileges and immunities enjoyed by the United Nations by virtue of Article 105 of its Charter are conferred in the interests of the Organization . These privileges and immunities furnish no excuse to those who are covered by them to fail to observe the laws and police regulations of the State in which they are located ; nor do they furnish an excuse for non-performance of their private obligations . In any case where an issue arises regarding the application of these privileges and immunities , an official or an expert on mission shall immediately report the matter to the Secretary-General , who alone may decide whether such privileges and immunities exist and whether they shall be waived , in accordance with the relevant instruments . The Secretary-General should inform and may take into account the views of the legislative bodies that appointed the officials or experts on mission . Commentary Regulation 1 ( e ) , which deals with privileges and immunities , is similar to staff regulation 1.1 ( f ) ( see paras . 32 , 49 , 54 and 55 of the report on standards of conduct in the international civil service 1954 , which was prepared by the International Civil Service Advisory Board ( hereinafter referred to as "" the ICSAB report "" )) . Regulation 2 ( j ) specifies the obligations on those who are covered by such privileges and immunities to honour their private legal obligations . Pursuant to article V , section 20 , and article VI , section 23 , of the General Convention , it is only the Secretary-General who has the right to waive the privileges and immunities accorded to officials and experts on mission . In deciding whether such privileges and immunities exist and whether they should be waived , the Secretary-General may take into account the views of the legislative body that appointed the officials or experts on mission . Regulation 1 ( f ) These regulations are applicable to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the International Civil Service Commission and the Inspectors of the Joint Inspection Unit , without prejudice to and in accordance with the statutes of the International Civil Service Commission and the Joint Inspection Unit , which stipulate that these officials perform their functions in respect of the United Nations and other organizations that accept their statutes . [ There is no commentary to this provision . ] Regulation 2 Conduct Regulation 2 ( a ) Officials and experts on mission shall uphold the highest standards of efficiency , competence and integrity . The concept of integrity includes , but is not limited to , probity , impartiality , fairness , honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting their work and status . Commentary Regulation 2 ( a ) , which describes basic values expected of officials and experts on mission , is similar to staff regulation 1.2 ( b ) . The first sentence of regulation 2 ( a ) is derived from Article 101 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations by virtue of affirmatively placing upon officials and experts on mission the obligation to uphold the highest standards of efficiency , competence and integrity . As pointed out in paragraph 4 of the ICSAB report , the concept of integrity includes "" honesty , truthfulness , fidelity , probity and freedom from corrupting influences "" . Regulation 2 ( b ) In the performance of their duties , officials and experts on mission shall neither seek nor accept instructions from any Government or from any other source external to the Organization . Commentary Regulation 2 ( b ) , which is similar to staff regulation 1.2 ( d ) , flows from the first sentence of Article 100 , paragraph 1 , of the Charter of the United Nations ( see ICSAB report , paras . 7 , 18 and 31 ) . Regulation 2 ( c ) Officials and experts on mission shall discharge their functions and regulate their conduct with the interests of the Organization only in view . Loyalty to the aims , principles and purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in its Charter , is a fundamental obligation of all individuals covered by the present Regulations . Commentary Regulation 2 ( c ) in substance contains the same obligations as are contained in staff regulation 1.2 ( e ) applicable to staff . The first sentence of regulation 2 ( c ) sets forth an idea that is contained in staff regulation 1.1 ( a ) and in staff regulation 1.1 ( b ) , which contains the written declaration of office , that is to say , the idea that staff must regulate their conduct with the interests of the Organization only in view ( ibid. , para . The second sentence of regulation 2 ( c ) focuses on the concept of loyalty to the aims , principles and purposes of the Organization as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations ( which is alluded to in the declaration contained in regulation 1 ( b )) ( ibid. , paras . 5 , 6 and 21 ) . Regulation 2 ( d ) While the personal views and convictions of officials and experts on mission , including their political and religious convictions , remain inviolable , they shall ensure that those views and convictions do not adversely affect their official duties or the interests of the United Nations . Officials and experts on mission shall conduct themselves at all times in a manner befitting their status . They shall not engage in any activity that is incompatible with the proper discharge of their duties with the United Nations . They shall avoid any action and , in particular , any kind of public pronouncement that may adversely reflect on their status , or on the integrity , independence and impartiality that are required by that status . Commentary Regulation 2 ( d ) is similar to staff regulation 1.2 ( f ) . The core idea of conduct befitting an international civil servant was considered by the International Civil Service Advisory Board in 1954 . The Advisory Board remarked that "" high standards of conduct are best attained by a universal understanding among staff members of the relation between their conduct and the success of the international organizations , and by the development of a strong tradition among men and women who are jealous of the reputation of the organizations that they serve and are anxious to safeguard it "" ( ICSAB report , para . 2 ; see also para . 4 , on the integrity expected of international civil servants ; paras . 5 , 6 and 21 , on loyalty ; paras . 7 and 18 , on independence ; and paras . 8 and 48 , on impartiality ) . In respect of the last sentence of the regulation , it would be for the Organization to characterize an action or pronouncement as adversely reflecting on the status of an official or an expert on mission . Regulation 2 ( e ) Officials and experts on mission shall not use their office or knowledge gained from their official functions for private gain , financial or otherwise , or for the gain of any third party , including family , friends and those they favour . Nor shall they use their office for personal reasons to prejudice the positions of those they do not favour . Commentary Regulation 2 ( e ) , which is similar to staff regulation 1.2 ( g ) , codifies principles set out in the ICSAB report ( see paras . 17 , 28 and 42 ) . The use of one's office for personal gain is clearly unacceptable . This includes not only conducting a business from a United Nations office but also such activities as using United Nations facilities for a business , using the United Nations name , logo or address for a business and approving a contract for a family business without disclosure . Regulation 2 ( e ) also reflects the principle set out in staff regulation 1.2 ( g ) that a staff member shall not use information that has not been made public for the private advantage of the staff member or of any third party . The regulation , for clarity , makes specific reference to prohibiting an official or expert on mission from so favouring a third party , including family or friends , as to enable that third party to profit from the position of the official or expert on mission or from the exercise of his or her functions . The term "" friends "" is broad and seeks to encompass not only friends as normally understood , but also relationships that are not recognized by the United Nations as creating a dependency . The regulation also prohibits the use of office or knowledge gained from that office for personal reasons to prejudice or harm third parties . Regulation 2 ( f ) Officials and experts on mission shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters of official business . Officials and experts on mission shall not communicate to any Government , entity , person or any other source any information known to them by reason of their official position that they know or ought to have known has not been made public , except as appropriate in the normal course of their duties or by authorization of the Secretary-General . If they are not appointed by the Secretary-General , such authorization shall be conferred by the body that appointed them . These obligations do not cease upon the cessation of their official functions . Commentary Regulation 2 ( f ) , which is similar to staff regulation 1.2 ( i ) , reflects the principle that official information may not be used for private purposes , except with authorization . This flows from the idea that officials and experts on mission are obligated to regulate their conduct with the interests of the Organization only in view ( see ICSAB report , para . 4 ) and also from the requirements of regulation 2 ( e ) . It follows that permission must be obtained for disclosure to third parties of information that has not been made public , unless such disclosure is specifically authorized or is in the normal course of duties of the official or expert on mission . Authorization of the Secretary-General is not required for officials and experts on mission who have not been appointed by the Secretary-General . Those officials and experts on mission would require the authorization of the body that had appointed them if the communication of the information was not a normal part of their duties . The last sentence of the regulation provides that the obligations contained in the provision do not cease upon cessation of official functions . It may be difficult to enforce such a provision , but , at the very least , if a former official or expert on mission ignored the obligations contained in this regulation , the official file of the former official or expert on mission could be noted so as to prevent his or her re-engagement . Regulation 2 ( g ) Officials and experts on mission may not accept any honour , decoration , favour , gift or remuneration from any Government or non-governmental source for activities carried out during the course of their official functions while in the service of the United Nations . Commentary To ensure that officials and experts are perceived as impartial , regulation 2 ( g ) prohibits the acceptance of any honour , decoration , favour , gift or remuneration from any Government or non-governmental source for activities carried out during the course of their official functions while in the service of the United Nations . Regulation 2 ( h ) Officials and experts on mission shall not be actively associated with the management of , or hold a financial interest in , any profit-making , business or other concern , if it were possible for them or the profit-making , business or other concern to benefit from such association or financial interest by reason of their position with the United Nations . Officials or experts on mission who are in such a situation shall either dispose of that financial interest or formally excuse themselves from participating with regard to any involvement in that matter that has given rise to the conflict-of-interest situation . Commentary The first sentence of regulation 2 ( h ) is similar to staff regulation 1.2 ( m ) . The purpose of the provision is to put officials and experts on mission on notice that they can not be actively associated with a profit-making , business or other concern , if either the concern or the official or expert on mission is to profit therefrom by reason of the association with the Organization . It will be for the Secretary-General or the appointing authority to judge whether a particular act has given rise to a conflict-of-interest situation . The second sentence of regulation 2 ( h ) is similar to the second part of staff rule 101.2 ( n ) , which deals with the consequences of a staff member 's having a possible conflict-of-interest situation . In such cases , the official or expert on mission shall dispose of the interests or , if practicable , shall excuse himself or herself from dealing with the matter on behalf of the Organization . Generally , experts on mission are appointed on a part-time basis , and it is therefore likely that they are engaged in other activities , including employment , when they are not performing services for the Organization . While there is no question that experts on mission may be so engaged , they must ensure that those activities are not incompatible with their status or functions as experts on mission . Regulation 2 ( i ) Officials and experts on mission shall file financial disclosure statements if requested to do so by the Secretary-General . The Secretary-General shall prescribe the format and information to be provided in such statements and shall establish procedures for filing them . The financial disclosure statements will remain confidential and will be used , as prescribed by the Secretary-General , only in making determinations pursuant to regulation 2 ( h ) . It will be for the Secretary-General , in due consultation with the appointing authority in the case of officials not appointed by the Secretary-General , to judge whether a particular fact has given rise to a conflict-of-interest situation . Commentary Regulation 2 ( i ) is similar to , but more general than , staff regulation 1.2 ( n ) , which requires all staff at the assistant secretary-general level and above to submit financial disclosure statements upon appointment and at intervals as prescribed by the Secretary-General , in respect of themselves and their dependent children , including any substantial transfers of assets and property to spouses and dependent children from the staff member or from any other source that might constitute a conflict of interest . This requirement is designed to minimize the risk of a perception of officials and experts on mission as using their position for personal gain . The regulation enables the Secretary-General to require officials and experts on mission to file financial disclosure statements , which will remain confidential and will be used only in dealing with conflict-of-interest situations ( for example , in assessing whether an official was in such a situation ) . Regulation 2 ( j ) Officials and experts on mission must comply with local laws and honour their private legal obligations , including , but not limited to , the obligation to honour orders of competent courts . Commentary Regulation 2 ( j ) , which is similar to staff rule 101.2 ( c ) , is really an amplification of regulation 1 ( e ) , which provides that the privileges and immunities of the Organization afford no excuse for non-performance of private obligations ( ibid. , paras . 32 , 54 and 55 ) . Regulation 2 ( j ) makes clear that private obligations must be honoured . It is the responsibility of those subject to the present Regulations , if they have a court order against them that they contest , to avail themselves of all means existing under the applicable national law to appeal the order and / or to secure relief from the obligation to comply with the order pending its appeal . Regulation 2 ( k ) Any form of discrimination or harassment , including sexual or gender harassment , as well as physical or verbal abuse , at the workplace or in connection with work , is prohibited . Commentary Regulation 2 ( k ) , which is similar to staff rule 101.2 ( d ) , reproduces the core of Secretary-General's bulletin ST / SGB / 253 of 29 October 1992 , which established United Nations policy on equal treatment of men and women in the Secretariat and also prohibited all forms of discrimination or harassment . Regulation 2 ( l ) Officials and experts on mission shall not intentionally misrepresent their functions , official title or the nature of their duties to Member States or to any entities or persons external to the United Nations . Commentary Regulation 2 ( l ) is similar to staff rule 101.2 ( f ) , which prohibits the intentional misrepresentation of an official title or duties to outside parties ( for example , by placing misleading titles on business cards ) . The use of the word "" intentional "" makes clear that this does not refer to careless or accidental acts . Regulation 2 ( m ) Officials and experts on mission participating , as part of their official functions , in activities organized by a Government , intergovernmental organization , non-governmental organization or other private source may receive from the Government , intergovernmental organization , non-governmental organization or private source accommodation and travel and subsistence allowance generally in line with those payable by the United Nations . In such cases , the travel and subsistence allowance that may otherwise be payable by the United Nations shall be reduced in the same manner as in respect of staff members of the Organization . Commentary Regulation 2 ( m ) , which is similar to staff rule 101.2 ( s ) , deals with the issue of participation at various official functions . Officials and experts on mission who as part of their official functions participate in activities organized by a Government , intergovernmental organization , non-governmental organization or other private source may receive from it accommodation and travel and subsistence allowance generally in line with those payable by the United Nations , and in such cases the allowances that may otherwise be payable by the United Nations shall be reduced in the same amount as in respect of staff members of the Organization . Such provisions are presently found in staff rule 107.15 ( a ) . It should be noted that accommodation and travel and subsistence allowance may be accepted only if their acceptance would be appropriate to the status of officials and experts on mission and to the integrity , independence and impartiality that are required by that status . There may therefore be situations in which it would not be appropriate to accept those allowances from a Government , intergovernmental organization , non-governmental organization or other private source . Regulation 3 Accountability Officials and experts on mission are accountable to the United Nations for the proper discharge of their functions . Commentary Regulation 3 , which is similar to staff regulation 1.3 ( a ) , makes clear that officials and experts on mission are accountable for their actions . The method of accountability may vary . For officials appointed by the General Assembly , that accountability would be a matter for the Assembly . For experts on mission , it would be the Secretary-General or the appointing authority who could terminate an assignment or otherwise admonish the expert . United Nations , Treaty Series , vol. I , No. 4 , p. 15 .

57	"III Chapter Three They were three full , exquisite days--a true honeymoon . They were at the Hotel-de-Boulogne , on the harbour ; and they lived there , with drawn blinds and closed doors , with flowers on the floor , and iced syrups were brought them early in the morning . Towards evening they took a covered boat and went to dine on one of the islands . It was the time when one hears by the side of the dockyard the caulking-mallets sounding against the hull of vessels . The smoke of the tar rose up between the trees ; there were large fatty drops on the water , undulating in the purple colour of the sun , like floating plaques of Florentine bronze . They rowed down in the midst of moored boats , whose long oblique cables grazed lightly against the bottom of the boat . The din of the town gradually grew distant ; the rolling of carriages , the tumult of voices , the yelping of dogs on the decks of vessels . She took off her bonnet , and they landed on their island . They sat down in the low-ceilinged room of a tavern , at whose door hung black nets . They ate fried smelts , cream and cherries . They lay down upon the grass ; they kissed behind the poplars ; and they would fain , like two Robinsons , have lived for ever in this little place , which seemed to them in their beatitude the most magnificent on earth . It was not the first time that they had seen trees , a blue sky , meadows ; that they had heard the water flowing and the wind blowing in the leaves ; but , no doubt , they had never admired all this , as if Nature had not existed before , or had only begun to be beautiful since the gratification of their desires . At night they returned . The boat glided along the shores of the islands . They sat at the bottom , both hidden by the shade , in silence . The square oars rang in the iron thwarts , and , in the stillness , seemed to mark time , like the beating of a metronome , while at the stern the rudder that trailed behind never ceased its gentle splash against the water . Once the moon rose ; they did not fail to make fine phrases , finding the orb melancholy and full of poetry . She even began to sing -- "" One night , do you remember , we were sailing , "" etc. Her musical but weak voice died away along the waves , and the winds carried off the trills that Leon heard pass like the flapping of wings about him . She was opposite him , leaning against the partition of the shallop , through one of whose raised blinds the moon streamed in . Her black dress , whose drapery spread out like a fan , made her seem more slender , taller . Her head was raised , her hands clasped , her eyes turned towards heaven . At times the shadow of the willows hid her completely ; then she reappeared suddenly , like a vision in the moonlight . Leon , on the floor by her side , found under his hand a ribbon of scarlet silk . The boatman looked at it , and at last said -- "" Perhaps it belongs to the party I took out the other day . A lot of jolly folk , gentlemen and ladies , with cakes , champagne , cornets--everything in style ! There was one especially , a tall handsome man with small moustaches , who was that funny ! And they all kept saying , ' Now tell us something , Adolphe--Dolpe , ' I think . "" She shivered . "" You are in pain ? "" asked Leon , coming closer to her . "" Oh , it 's nothing ! No doubt , it is only the night air . "" "" And who does n ' t want for women , either , "" softly added the sailor , thinking he was paying the stranger a compliment . Then , spitting on his hands , he took the oars again . Yet they had to part . The adieux were sad . He was to send his letters to Mere Rollet , and she gave him such precise instructions about a double envelope that he admired greatly her amorous astuteness . "" So you can assure me it is all right ? "" she said with her last kiss . "" Yes , certainly . "" "" But why , "" he thought afterwards as he came back through the streets alone , "" is she so very anxious to get this power of attorney ? """	Prose/Lyrical

1211	"Brexit must happen on time , Theresa May insists Theresa May has said she is "" clear "" she expects to start talks on leaving the EU as planned by the end of March . The prime minister also played down the chances of an early general election , saying the next one "" should "" take place as scheduled in 2020 . The government is appealing against the High Court's decision that MPs and peers should vote on triggering Brexit . Mrs May said judges should "" specify how "" the vote might happen , if ministers are defeated again . The High Court ruled last Thursday that Parliament should have a say before the UK invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - which triggers up to two years of formal EU withdrawal talks . Labour has said it will not attempt to delay or scupper this process . Brexit live : Rolling text and video updates Judges ' could need democratic controls' Brexit court ruling : Your questions answered The legal questions at the heart of the High Court Article 50 ruling But the government argues that a parliamentary vote is not necessary as it already has powers to decide when negotiations with the EU should start . The Supreme Court is expected to hear its appeal early next month . Speaking to BBC Business Editor Simon Jack on a trade visit to India , Mrs May said : "" I 'm clear that I expect to be able to trigger Article 50 by the end of March next year . That 's what I 've said consistently and I continue to work on that basis . "" She added : "" We believe the government has got strong legal arguments . We 'll be putting those arguments to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court will make its judgement . "" There is some debate about whether a vote at Westminster on invoking Article 50 would require a full Act of Parliament , or whether it could happen much more speedily by MPs and peers agreeing to a resolution - a written motion - instead . Media captionLabour's Keir Starmer reacts to Brexit Secretary David Davis' statement on Article 50 Asked about this , Mrs May suggested that she would expect the court to set out which of the two options would be required . She said : "" If it were the case that the Supreme Court were to uphold the view of the High Court , then the judgement would set out what the details were . "" In recent days , the idea of an early election has been raised , but Mrs May said : "" I 've been clear the next general election should be in 2020 . "" The government is getting on with the job in delivering what people voted for on 23 June which was for Britain to leave the European Union . We 're going to put that in to practice . "" In June's UK-wide referendum , voters opted by 51.9 % to 48.1 % in favour of leaving the EU . Media captionBrexit Secretary David Davis' statement to MPs after the High Court ruling on Article 50 Earlier on Monday , Brexit Secretary David Davis gave the government's official response to the High Court's ruling , telling MPs the referendum result "" must be respected and delivered "" . He added : "" There must be no attempt to remain inside the EU now , attempting it behind the back door or a second referendum . "" For Labour , shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Parliament had to have a vote on the issue , as it was "" sovereign "" and , because of this , "" that scrutiny matters "" . However , his party would not "" frustrate "" the process of invoking Article 50 , he added . Brexit : All you need to know What has actually happened since Brexit ? He told MPs the government's approach was "" unravelling "" in an "" ugly way "" , adding : "" We saw a series of appalling personal attacks on the judges , including the suggestion that they were ' enemies of the people ' . "" This was a reference to a headline used in the Daily Mail on Friday - the day after the High Court's decision . Mr Davis insisted that "" we believe in and value the independence of our judiciary "" , but defended the freedom of the press . "" Both these things underpin our democracy , "" he said . Suzanne Evans , one of the three candidates for the UKIP leadership contest , told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme that judges could be "" subject to some kind of democratic control "" following the High Court's decision . She did not want to undermine "" their judicial independence "" , but added : "" I suppose that in this case , we have had a situation where we have judges committed to stay in the European Union ... "" I 'm questioning the legitimacy of this particular case . We know that the legal profession threw a collective hissy fit when we voted to leave . "" Scotland's Brexit minister , the SNP's Michael Russell , said he could not imagine any circumstances in which his party's MPs would vote in favour of triggering Article 50 ."	News
207	"Personnel matters Report by the Director-General Contents Developments on personnel-related matters The Organization continued to strengthen its field presence by increasing the number of Professional staff ( international and local ) in the field . As of 1 September 2008 there were 56 Professional staff in the field ( 39 international and 17 national ) , which constitutes a 43 per cent increase since the field mobility policy was launched in April 2006 . The modalities of implementation of the Young Professionals Programme ( YPP ) were finalized and a policy document was issued containing provisions for the recruitment and career management of those to be recruited under this programme . The programme aims at facilitating succession planning , knowledge retention and rejuvenating the workforce through the recruitment , on a competitive basis , of young talent into the Organization . The programme targets individuals under the age of 30 who will be recruited for a three-year fixed term appointment at the P-1 level . Once recruited they will follow a managed development programme , including the possibility of a field assignment . The YPP includes ten positions in the Programme Development and Technical Cooperation ( PTC ) and the Programme Coordination and Field Operations ( PCF ) Divisions . A revised learning policy has been presented for staff / management consultations to the Joint Advisory Committee ( JAC ) . The policy recognizes the fact that UNIDO's most important resource is its staff and the knowledge and technical expertise embodied in them . It takes into consideration the challenging and dynamic business environment , in which UNIDO is operating as well as the need for the Organization to be a learning organization . The policy also introduces some measures to encourage continuous flow of knowledge and ideas between the Organization and the external environment through partnerships and exchanges with educational and research institutions as well as other organizations . Following the success of the leadership development programme that was implemented in 2007 for managers , the Organization has introduced a management development programme for all Professional staff at the P-1 to P-4 levels as well as National Programme Officers . The programme is made up of three specific modules and seeks to enhance staff members' management skills and competencies in achieving results through working with other people and leading their subordinates . The programme will continue over two years . In addition to its regular training programmes , the Organization also introduced a number of training events to familiarize and update staff with its various administrative rules and processes . Programmes were run on the Financial Performance Control System ( FPCS ) and project management . A mandatory procurement training programme was introduced to ensure that staff members involved in procurement activities have sufficient knowledge of the related rules . Participants in the first phase of this programme do a self study of the Procurement Manual following which they undertake an intranet-based test . Upon successful completion of the test , they receive a certificate . Advanced training on procurement will also be provided covering issues such as preparing technical specifications and terms of reference , evaluating offers , procurement ethics and fiduciary oversight . Staff in duty stations away from Headquarters were also invited for a one week training programme organized in Vienna . The training included staff assigned to Investment and Technology Promotion Offices and other offices . The training focused on supporting staff in these offices to increase the offices' level of efficiency and effectiveness . Good employee relations remained a high priority for management and various actions were implemented to ensure staff engagement . The year was marked by an intensification of staff / management consultations , especially within the framework of the Joint Advisory Committee ( JAC ) . During the relevant period , meetings were held regularly ( at least once a month ) , during which staff and management representatives discussed various issues related to staff welfare , conditions of work , reviewed existing policies and consulted on new ones . The discussions included such subjects as the UNIDO Young Professionals Programme , the UNIDO policy on protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct and for cooperating with duly authorized audits and investigations , the UNIDO policy on learning and performance appraisal . JAC discussions will also include the UNIDO Code of Conduct and the financial disclosure programme . The Director-General continued to meet directly with randomly selected staff members in the context of his initiative "" Dialogue with the Director-General "" . Two such meetings were held in 2008 and they continued to be a valuable forum for generating proposals , inputs and feedback on organizational issues . A similar initiative has been introduced by the Managing Director of the Programme Development and Technical Cooperation Division ( PTC ) . In addition to meeting with the Professional staff as part of the performance appraisal process , he also met with his General Service staff . The views generated from such meetings will serve as valuable inputs for management decision-making . Common system developments Salary scale for staff in the Professional and higher categories Schedule I to the staff regulations . The concept of the base / floor salary scale was introduced by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 44 / 198 , section I. H , of 21 December 1989 . The scale is set by reference to the salary scale of the comparator civil service ( the federal civil service of the United States of America ) in Washington , D. C. Periodic adjustments are made on the basis of a comparison of net base salaries of United Nations officials with the corresponding salaries of their counterparts in the United States federal civil service . By resolution 62 / 227 of 21 December 2007 , the General Assembly approved , with effect from 1 January 2008 , a revised base scale for staff in the Professional and higher categories . The scale reflects the consolidation , on a no loss / no gain basis , of 1.97 multiplier points of post adjustment into the base salary scale . The increase of the base / floor salary scale by 1.97 per cent does not affect the level of remuneration of staff , as the post adjustment portion has been reduced by the amount consolidated into the base salary . Upon implementation of the revised base salary scale , revised post adjustment indices and multipliers have been established by the International Civil Service Commission ( ICSC ) for all duty stations . Changes in post adjustment multipliers due after 1 January 2008 have been effected on the basis of the movement of the newly consolidated post adjustment indices . The revised base salary scale for staff in the Professional and higher categories , effective 1 January 2008 , is set out in annex I to this document . The financial implications of the consolidation of 1.97 per cent of post adjustment into base salaries on a no gain / no loss basis normally had an impact on two groups of staff entitlements , namely the hardship / mobility allowance and the repatriation grant . Following changes in the hardship and mobility scheme effective 1 January 2007 ( see below ) , this allowance is no longer linked to the salary scale and is no longer relevant in connection with the consolidation process . As for the repatriation grant , the consolidation resulted in a similar increase in the payments of this entitlement to eligible staff . The programme and budgets , 2008-2009 , as approved by Member States , contains provisions to absorb the related cost increases . Matters related to the staff rules Pensionable remuneration for staff in the Professional and higher categories Appendix C to the staff rules . In accordance with Article 54 ( b ) of the regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund , the scale of pensionable remuneration for the Professional and higher categories must be adjusted on the same date and by the same percentage as the net remuneration of United Nations officials serving in New York . In accordance with this provision , ICSC promulgated revised scales of pensionable remuneration effective 1 September 2007 and 1 August 2008 . These were promulgated in appendix C to the staff rules and are contained in annexes II and III to the present document . Salary scale for staff in the General Service category Appendix A to the staff rules . In accordance with the Flemming principle , General Service staff shall have pay and other conditions of employment that match the best on offer at the duty station . The principle was first stated in 1949 by a body of experts on pay established by the United Nations General Assembly . It is the cornerstone of the methodology followed by ICSC for the conduct of local salary surveys . Based upon the Flemming principle , staff regulation 6.5 ( a ) provides that "" The Director-General shall fix the salary scales for staff in the General Service and related categories , normally on the basis of the best prevailing conditions of employment in the locality , taking into account the recommendations of the International Civil Service Commission . "" According to the approved ICSC methodology , which takes account of changes in the consumer price and wages indices over a period of 12 months , and in consultation with the other Vienna-based organizations , the Director-General implemented effective 1 April 2007 an interim adjustment of the salary scales for General Service staff of 1.96 per cent . The revised scale is contained in annex IV to the present document . Assignment grant and mobility / hardship allowance Appendix N to the Staff Rules has been amended to reflect changes to the mobility and hardship scheme effective 1 January 2007 , as approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 61 / 239 of 22 December 2006 on the recommendation of the International Civil Service Commission . Following extensive consultations on the modalities of implementation of the revised scheme among the United Nations Common System Organizations , the scheme was implemented with appropriate transitional measures . The new Appendix N containing the revised conditions is shown in annex V to the present document with deletions shown in square brackets and amendments being underlined . Staff rule 103.12 on Appointment and Promotion Board Staff rule 103.12 ( a ) ( i ) has been amended to indicate that posts in the General Service category in field duty stations are exempt from submission to the General Service Selection Panel of the Appointment and Promotion Board . The revised staff rule 103.12 ( a ) ( i ) is contained in annex VI to the present document with amendments being underlined . The amendment was introduced in the interest of efficiency while the competitive process was maintained and is implemented locally . Financial implications The financial implications of the above changes have been anticipated in the programme and budgets for the biennium 2008-2009 . Social Security Agreement Negotiations between UNIDO and the Republic of Austria regarding a new social security agreement as a supplementary agreement to the Headquarters Agreement of 1995 ( decision GC . 6 / Dec. 21 refers ) have been concluded . The agreement will be presented to the Board at its thirty-sixth session for approval and may be provisionally applied pending its approval by the Industrial Development Board and the General Conference and its entry into force . Action required by the Board The Board may wish to consider the adoption of the following draft decision : "" The Industrial Development Board ; "" ( a ) Takes note of the information contained in document IDB . 35 / 13 ; "" ( b ) Notes the amendments made in pursuance to staff regulation 13.3 to schedule I of the staff regulations in order to bring them into conformity with the decision of the General Assembly set out in resolution 62 / 227 ; "" ( c ) Also notes the amendment to appendices A , C and N to the staff rules and to the staff rule 103.12 ( a ) ( i ) . "" Annex I Schedule I Salary scales for the Professional and higher categories showing annual gross salaries and the net equivalents after application of staff assessment ( in United States dollars ) Effective 1 January D = Rate applicable to staff members with a dependent spouse or child .

If the staff member did not remain for at least three years , recovery of a one-month lump sum shall be effected . If , however , the staff member's appointment or expected duration of assignment to the duty station is for two years or less , only one month's net base salary ( plus appropriate additional elements ) is payable ; the second month's net base salary ( plus appropriate additional elements ) is payable at the start of the third year at the duty station if the staff member's appointment or assignment is extended to a total period of three years or more . ( f ) No change . ( g ) No change . ( h ) No change . ( i ) No change . ( j ) No change . Mobility / hardship allowance ( a ) Staff members in the Professional and higher categories , including project personnel and internationally recruited General Service staff members , who are appointed or assigned to a duty station for one year or more shall be eligible for the payment of a mobility / hardship allowance . The allowance shall be paid according to the staff member's entitlements with respect to the following components of the allowance : ( i ) The mobility element , as an incentive [ to staff of organizations participating in the United Nations common system to accept reassignments to different duty stations ] for the geographic mobility of staff ; ( ii ) The hardship element , [ as an incentive to staff to serve at field duty stations with varying degrees of hardship ] as compensation for the varying degrees of hardship at different duty stations ; ( iii ) The non removal element , as compensation for the non removal of personal effects and household goods . ( b ) [ The staff member's entitlement to the allowance are reckoned in terms of percentage points of a base salary rate , as defined in paragraph ( d ) below . With respect to each of the three elements , the percentage points may be accrued as follows : ] Lump sum payments of the mobility / hardship allowances are made in the form of flat amounts set by the International Civil Service Commission . The amount of the allowances payable to each eligible staff member may vary as follows : ( i ) Mobility [ element : ] allowance : At H duty stations , nil for the first three assignments . Mobility allowance is paid upon [ 4 percentage points for ] the fourth assignment ( provided that at least two of the previous assignments were at A-E [ field ] duty stations ) . [ and 6 percentage points for the fifth and subsequent assignments ; ] For payment purposes , the number of assignments are grouped as four to six assignments and seven or more assignments ; b . At [ all other ] A-E duty stations , nil for the first assignment [ ; ] . Mobility allowance is paid upon [ 10 percentage points for ] the second assignment . - [ and 2 additional percentage points for each subsequent assignment up to and including the fifth assignment ; ] For payment purposes , the number of assignments are grouped as two to three assignments , four to six assignments and seven or more assignments ; ( ii ) Hardship [ element ] allowance : nil for H and A duty stations . [ and 8 , 15 , 20 and 25 percentage points ] Payments begin with first assignment to [ for ] B , C , D and E duty stations [ respectively ] ; ( iii ) Non removal [ element ] allowance : [ 3 percentage points at H duty stations and 5 percentage points at all other duty stations . ] Flat amounts are paid for duty stations H to E. [ ( c ) The matrix below shows the various combinations of percentage points that may be accrued cumulatively on account of the three elements of the allowance . Mobility / hardship allowance matrix a Plus 3 per cent if the staff member is not entitled to the removal of household goods . b Provided that the staff member has previously served on two or more assignments in A E duty stations , otherwise no entitlement is payable . c Minus 5 per cent if the staff member receives full household removal . ] [ ( d ) ] ( c ) [ The actual amount of the allowance is determined by applying the percentage points to a base salary rate , which is equivalent to the net base salary of staff at the mid point of the Professional salary scale , i . e . P 4 , step VI , at the dependency rate . This base salary rate is applicable to staff at levels P 4 and P 5 . It is increased by 13 per cent for staff at levels D1 and above and reduced by 13 per cent for staff at levels P 1 to P 3 and internationally recruited General Service staff . For staff who have no dependent spouse or child , the allowance is calculated at 75 per cent of the base salary rate appropriate to their grade . ] The mobility / hardship allowances are flat amounts . Payments are differentiated by the following grade groupings : P-1 to P-3 and internationally recruited General Service staff , P-4 and P-5 and D-1 and above . Single staff shall receive 75 per cent of the flat amount paid to staff with dependants of the corresponding grade range . [ ( e ) ] ( d ) The mobility / hardship allowance is payable to all eligible staff [ including those serving in their own country ] and is non pensionable . [ The allowance is normally paid in a lump sum at the beginning of each 12 month period that the staff member is expected to remain at the duty station or pro rata as appropriate . ] [ ( f ) ] ( e ) The allowance shall be payable at the dependency rate to a staff member with recognized dependants , irrespective of where the dependants actually reside . When both husband and wife are staff members entitled to the allowance , it shall be paid to each of them in an amount calculated on the basis of his or her own salary level . [ ( g ) ] ( f ) Staff members who are assigned to a particular duty station and are then placed in travel or mission status while in receipt of a daily subsistence allowance ( DSA ) shall be eligible for the mobility / hardship allowance in respect of the duty station to which they were originally assigned and not in respect of the duty station at which they are in travel or mission status . Mobility element [ ( h ) ] ( g ) Entitlement to the mobility element is subject to the requirement that the staff member concerned should have had five or more consecutive years of service in an organization participating in the United Nations common system . This requirement may be considered as met if the staff member has accumulated five years of service within a period of six consecutive years . Continuity of service is not considered as broken by periods of special leave without pay , but full months of any such period are not to be credited as service for the purpose of this allowance . [ ( i ) ] ( h ) In counting the number of assignments for the application of the mobility element , the following guidelines will be taken into account : ( A ) An assignment will not be counted as such unless it involves the installation of the staff member at the duty station ( i . e . payment by the Organization of travel expenses and the assignment grant ) except in the case of an initial appointment for one year or more where no travel expenses and assignment grant have been paid ; ( B ) Any period of service on travel or mission status while in receipt of DSA will not be counted as an assignment . However , if such status is extended beyond one year at the same duty station , that period will be so counted ; ( C ) If a staff member is posted to a duty station for an initial period of less than one year and the period is subsequently extended so that service at the duty station equals or exceeds one year , such service will be counted as an assignment ; ( D ) In the case of consecutive assignments of less than one year at different duty stations during which the staff member is paid post adjustment under staff rule 106.04 ( c ) ( i ) or 206.12 ( d ) , the combined periods of such assignments may be counted as one assignment ; ( E ) If a staff member is assigned to a duty station for a period of one year or more and the period is subsequently reduced on the initiative of the Organization to less than a year's duration , such service should normally be counted as an assignment . [ ( j ) ] ( i ) Transfers , secondments and loans to other organizations participating in the United Nations common system are treated in the same way as movement within the Organization for the purpose of the mobility element , i . e . in order to be counted as an assignment , such transfers , secondments and loans should be for a period of one year or more and involve a change of duty station . [ ( k ) ] ( j ) The mobility allowance is paid in monthly instalments . Payment ceases after [ After ] five years of service at the same duty station . [ , the mobility element is reduced by 10 percentage points on the matrix ; and if the duty station is one of the H duty stations , the mobility element will be reduced to nil . This limited period of five years may exceptionally be extended by the Organization up to one more year , if the staff member : ( a ) remains at the duty station on the initiative of the Organization ; or ( b ) is expected to be reassigned before the end of the sixth year . ] Hardship element [ ( l ) ] ( k ) The hardship element is payable from the initial appointment or the first assignment of a staff member to any of the duty stations classified in the B , C , D or E category , provided that the staff member meets the general conditions of eligibility for the allowance . Payments are made in monthly instalments . It remains applicable for the entire duration of the staff member's service at the duty station and for as long as that duty station remains classified in the category concerned . Upon a change in the classified category , an appropriate adjustment of [ the percentage points for ] the hardship element and the resulting amount of payment will be made . Non-removal element [ ( m ) ] ( l ) The element for non removal is applicable for a maximum period of five years at one duty station , provided the staff member is not entitled to a removal of household goods , irrespective of the length of his or her total consecutive service with an organization participating in the United Nations common system or at the duty station . Payments will be made in a lump-sum at the beginning of the assignment , up to a maximum of five years . [ This period may , exceptionally , be extended for up to two more years at the discretion of the Director-General . ] Annex VI Staff Rule 103.12 Appointment and Promotion Board ( a ) ( i ) An Appointment and Promotion Board shall be established by the Director-General to give advice on the appointment and promotion of staff in the Professional and General Service categories , and at the D-2 and D-1 levels , except for staff in the Office of the Director-General , heads of the Bureaux reporting to the Director-General , entry grades G-1 / G-2 in the General Service category and staff in the General Service category serving at field duty stations ; For reasons of economy , this document has been printed in a limited number .

1582	"Two more techniques for improving watering efficiency are grouping plants by container size and water requirement and using drip irrigation whenever possible . The Saunders Brothers distribute the ponds' water through a sophisticated , computerized irrigation system designed to show vertical inches of water applied over a particular area during a set time . The computer program has helped them know the exact amount of water scheduled for irrigation . As often happens with such conservation practices , Saunders Brothers , Inc. has realized significant operational cost savings from these investments . Last year , the family took a step further in irrigation efficiency . Tom takes up the tale : "" During the summer of 2011 , we invited two research professors from the University of Florida to help establish ET ( Evapotranspiration ) levels for all plants we grow . The work was the first of its kind in the United States and helped us establish definitive amounts of water needed by specific plants during the hottest times of the year . We plan to continue the work for two more years . Already we are seeing where we can cut irrigation levels , and we have found out that lower fertilizer levels due to the lower water requirement will actually grow an equally good plant at a savings . "" Between growing plants in plastic pots under plastic greenhouse covers and using plastic sheeting as the growing surface , the brothers found themselves accumulating a lot of that material . They are , however , innovative thinkers , so it 's no surprise that Saunders Brothers , Inc was the first container nursery in the United States to send its greenhouse film to Tyco Plastics in Monroe , Louisiana . "" In the early years , "" Tom says , "" our purchase of their plastic was dependent on them accepting our used plastic , which they then turned into garbage bags . We started this practice in 2002 . For years , we have palletized and shipped our plastic propagation trays to the Canadian Poly Recycling Association . We also recycle plastic containers that we are not planning on reusing . Finally , we recycle all cardboard that plants or other products arrive in . "" â John Page Williams"	Promotion

496	"Dominic Fifield at Darius and Girenas Stadium Wednesday July 27 , 2005 The Guardian Liverpool supporters have seen it all now . Most are still pinching themselves after seeing their side lift the European Cup in May . Some , perhaps unjustly , are flinching at the Â£ 7m paid to Southampton for Peter Crouch . But all must have reeled in disbelief here last night at the sight of Jamie Carragher scoring a goal . The centre-half's reward , his first in six years and only the third goal of his career , helped establish a lead in this tie which should see Liverpool safely through to the third qualifying stage . It was timely , too . The holders trailed briefly and , on an awkward surface against spirited opponents , flirted with disaster before , eventually , their class told . Article continues A two-goal advantage going into next week's return should prove sufficient to ensure progress , with the draw for the final qualifying phase to be made on Friday . The possibility of facing Everton at that stage looms large , though for the moment Liverpool can take heart at a job half done . Rafael BenÃ­tez leaves the Baltic encouraged that , if he can prise a goal from Carragher , he is a miracle worker indeed . "" It 's been such a long time it 's a little bit embarrassing really but I 'm delighted to get that monkey off my back , "" admitted the 27-year-old , whose last goal had come in the 7-1 thrashing of Southampton in January 1999 . "" Hopefully I can add to that now . The manager said after the game he wants another three or four this season . That 's the target . I probably deserve the match ball after that . Me scoring one is like someone else getting a hat-trick . "" Liverpool needed him to break that long duck . Preparation , by BenÃ­tez's standards , had been sketchy for this tie and , confronted by the Lithuanians' eager early aggression , the holders briefly teetered . For six minutes embarrassment threatened after Arturas Rimkevicius gathered from a throw-in and flummoxed the ponderous Sami Hyypia near the touchline . The striker tore towards the area and pulled back to the top of the six-yard box where Giedrius Barevicius' mis-hit shot wrong-footed JosÃ© Reina and dribbled in . The giddy reality of their lead took time to sink in with the locals and , had their striker Andrius Velicka been fit , they might have prospered further . Yet it always looked a temporary upset of the natural order . By the interval Liverpool were ahead . First Boudewijn Zenden's looping cross was nodded down by the debutant Crouch , a signing of real stature who provided no little elegance in his ground-play . Mindaugas Baguzis could have cleared but he dithered near the penalty spot and Djibril CissÃ© spun and thumped the equaliser into the corner . Kaunas's spirit momentarily drained and , while heads were down , Steven Gerrard's corner was headed in for Carragher's rare party piece . CissÃ© should have added a third before the interval , bursting on to Xabi Alonso's threaded pass and skimming a shot beyond Eduardas Kurskis only for Irmantas Zelmikas to scramble the ball from the line . The Frenchman missed again when clean through near the end but Liverpool's dominance had long since been established . There was real promise in the combination of Crouch and CissÃ© , the reassurance of Fernando Morientes emerging from the bench and Alonso's clever passing alongside Gerrard's purring menace in midfield . The hapless Baguzis tripped the galloping captain in the area nine minutes into the second period and Gerrard dispatched the penalty himself , his 15th European goal . "" We 're strong favourites and 90 % certain of going through after that but we 'll still need to find the other 10 % now , "" added Carragher . "" We 'll show them respect because we always do . "" Even so , a professional performance in what should prove a formality of the return next Tuesday and Liverpool , seeded and warming up nicely , will be one stage away from the Champions League proper ."

1105	"Broad Green station , Liverpool , shown in 1962 , opened in 1830 , is the oldest station site in the world still in use as a passenger station . Baker Street station , London , opened in 1863 , was the world's first station to be completely underground . Its original part , seen here , is just below the surface and was constructed by cut-and-cover tunnelling . Opened in 2006 , Berlin Hauptbahnhof is a large station at the crossing point of two major railways and features modern , abstract architecture . Berlin had a ring of terminus stations , similar to London and Paris , however they were gradually replaced with through stations from 1882 to 1952 . A train station , railway station , railroad station , or depot ( see below ) is a railway facility where trains regularly stop to load or unload passengers or freight . It generally consists of at least one track - side platform and a station building ( depot ) providing such ancillary services as ticket sales and waiting rooms . If a station is on a single-track line , it often has a passing loop to facilitate traffic movements . The smallest stations are most often referred to as "" stops "" or , in some parts of the world , as "" halts "" ( flag stops ) . Stations may be at ground level , underground , or elevated . Connections may be available to intersecting rail lines or other transport modes such as buses , trams or other rapid transit systems . In Britain and other Commonwealth countries , traditional usage favours railway station or simply station , even though train station , which is often perceived as an Americanism , is now about as common as railway station in writing ; railroad station is not used , railroad being obsolete there . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] In British usage , the word station is commonly understood to mean a railway station unless otherwise qualified . [ 4 ] In the United States , the most common term in contemporary usage is train station . Railway station and railroad station are less frequent . [ 5 ] In North America , the term depot is used most commonly as an alternative name for station , along with the compound forms train depot , railway depot , and railroad depot , but also applicable for buses and other vehicles , especially in rural areas where it might be understood as a direct equivalent to stop or halt . [ citation needed ] Outside of North America , a depot is "" [ a ] place where buses , trains , or other vehicles are housed and maintained and from which they are dispatched for service . "" [ 6 ] Grand Central Terminal in New York City is the world's largest station by number of platforms , having 67 tracks on two levels . The world's first recorded railway station was The Mount on the Oystermouth Railway ( later to be known as the Swansea and Mumbles ) in Swansea , Wales , [ 7 ] which began passenger service in 1807 , although the trains were horsedrawn rather than by locomotives . [ 8 ] The oldest terminal station in the world was Crown Street railway station in Liverpool , built in 1830 , on the Liverpool to Manchester line . As the first train on the Liverpool-Manchester line left Liverpool the station is slightly older than the Manchester terminal at Liverpool Road . The station was the first to incorporate a train shed . The station was demolished in 1836 as the Liverpool terminal station moved to Lime Street railway station . Crown Street station was converted to a goods station terminal . The first stations had little in the way of buildings or amenities . The first stations in the modern sense were on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway , opened in 1830 . [ 10 ] Manchester's Liverpool Road Station , the second oldest terminal station in the world , and the only surviving station , is preserved as part of the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester . It resembles a row of Georgian houses . Early stations were sometimes built with both passenger and goods facilities , though some railway lines were goods-only or passenger-only , and if a line was dual-purpose there would often be a goods depot apart from the passenger station . [ 11 ] Dual-purpose stations can sometimes still be found today , though in many cases goods facilities are restricted to major stations . In rural and remote communities across Canada and the United States , passengers wanting to board the train had to flag the train down in order for it to stop . Such stations were known as "" flag stops "" or "" flag stations "" . [ 12 ] Many stations date from the 19th century and reflect the grandiose architecture of the time , lending prestige to the city as well as to railway operations . [ 13 ] Countries where railways arrived later may still have such architecture , as later stations often imitated 19th-century styles . Various forms of architecture have been used in the construction of stations , from those boasting grand , intricate , Baroque - or Gothic - style edifices , to plainer utilitarian or modernist styles . Stations in Europe tended to follow British designs and were in some countries , like Italy , financed by British railway companies . [ 14 ] Stations built more recently often have a similar feel to airports , with a simple , abstract style . Examples of modern stations include those on newer high-speed rail networks , such as the Shinkansen in Japan , TGV lines in France and ICE lines in Germany . Stations usually have staffed ticket sales offices , automated ticket machines , or both , although on some lines tickets are sold on board the trains . Many stations include a shop or convenience store . Larger stations usually have fast-food or restaurant facilities . In some countries , stations may also have a bar or pub . Other station facilities may include : toilets , left-luggage , lost-and-found , departures and arrivals boards , luggage carts , waiting rooms , taxi ranks , bus bays and even car parks . Larger or manned stations tend to have a greater range of facilities including also a station security office . These are usually open for travellers when there is sufficient traffic over a long enough period of time to warrant the cost . In large cities this may mean facilities available around the clock . A basic station might only have platforms , though it may still be distinguished from a halt , a stopping or halting place that may not even have platforms . In many African and South American countries , and in many places in India , stations are used as a place for public markets and other informal businesses . This is especially true on tourist routes or stations near tourist destinations . As well as providing services for passengers and loading facilities for goods , stations can sometimes have locomotive and rolling stock depots ( usually with facilities for storing and refuelling rolling stock and carrying out minor repair jobs ) . In addition to the basic configuration of a station , various features set certain types of station apart . The first is the level of the tracks . Stations are often sited where a road crosses the railway : unless the crossing is a level crossing , the road and railway will be at different levels . The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to the station entrance : the station buildings may be on either level , or both . The other arrangement , where the station entrance and platforms are on the same level , is also common , but is perhaps rarer in urban areas , except when the station is a terminus . Elevated stations are more common , not including metro stations . Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the roadway while it stops , causing road traffic to wait for an extended period of time . Occasionally , a station serves two or more railway lines at differing levels . This may be due to the station's position at a point where two lines cross ( example : Berlin Hauptbahnhof ) , or may be to provide separate station capacity for two types of service , such as intercity and suburban ( examples : Paris-Gare de Lyon and Philadelphia's 30th Street Station ) , or for two different destinations . Stations may also be classified according to the layout of the platforms . Apart from single-track lines , the most basic arrangement is a pair of tracks for the two directions ; there is then a basic choice of an island platform between , or two separate platforms outside , the tracks . With more tracks , the possibilities expand . Some stations have unusual platform layouts due to space constraints of the station location , or the alignment of the tracks . Examples include staggered platforms , such as at Tutbury and Hatton railway station on the Derby â Crewe line , and curved platforms , such as Cheadle Hulme railway station on the Macclesfield to Manchester Line . Triangular stations also exist where two lines form a three-way junction and platforms are built on all three sides . In a station , there are different types of tracks to serve different purposes . A station may also have a passing loop with a loop line that comes off the straight main line and merge back to the main line on the other end by railroad switches to allow trains to pass . [ 15 ] A track with a spot at the station to board and disembark trains is called station track or house track [ 16 ] regardless of whether it is a main line or loop line . If such track is served by a platform , the track may be called platform track . A loop line without a platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only , it is called passing track . [ 15 ] A track at the station without a platform which is used for trains to pass the station without stopping is called through track . [ 16 ] There may be other sidings at the station which are lower speed tracks for other purposes . A maintenance track or a maintenance siding , usually connected to a passing track , is used for parking maintenance equipment , trains not in service , autoracks or sleepers . A refuge track is a dead-end siding that is connected to a station track as a temporary storage of a disabled train . [ 15 ] Opened in 1830 and reached through a tunnel , Liverpool's Crown Street railway station was the first ever railway terminus . The station was demolished after only six years , being replaced by Lime Street Station in the city centre . The tunnel still exists . Opened in 1836 , Spa Road railway station in London was the city's first terminus and also the world's first elevated station and terminus . A "" terminal "" or "" terminus "" is a station at the end of a railway line . Trains arriving there have to end their journeys ( terminate ) or reverse out of the station . Depending on the layout of the station , this usually permits travellers to reach all the platforms without the need to cross any tracks â the public entrance to the station and the main reception facilities being at the far end of the platforms . Sometimes , however , the track continues for a short distance beyond the station , and terminating trains continue forwards after depositing their passengers , before either proceeding to sidings or reversing to the station to pick up departing passengers . Bondi Junction is like this . Many terminus stations have underground rapid-transit urban rail stations beneath , to transit passengers to the local city or district . A terminus is frequently , but not always , the final destination of trains arriving at the station . However a number of cities , especially in continental Europe , have a terminus as their main railway stations , and all main lines converge on this station . There may also be a bypass line , used by freight trains that do not need to stop at the main station . In such cases all trains passing through that main station must leave in the reverse direction from that of their arrival . There are several ways in which this can be accomplished : arranging for the service to be provided by a multiple-unit or push-pull train , both of which are capable of operating in either direction ; the driver simply walks to the other end of the train and takes control from the other cab ; this is increasingly the normal method in Europe ; by detaching the locomotive which brought the train into the station and then either using another track to "" run it around "" to the other end of the train , to which it then re-attaches ; attaching a second locomotive to the outbound end of the train ; or by the use of a "" wye "" , a roughly triangular arrangement of track and switches ( points ) where a train can reverse direction and back into the terminal . Some termini have a newer set of through platforms underneath ( or above , or alongside ) the terminal platforms on the main level . They are used by a cross-city extension of the main line , often for commuter trains , while the terminal platforms may serve long-distance services . Examples of underground through lines include the Thameslink platforms at St. Pancras in London , the Argyle and North Clyde lines of Glasgow's suburban rail network , the recently built MalmÃ¶ City Tunnel , in Antwerp in Belgium , the RER at the Gare du Nord in Paris , and many of the numerous S-Bahn lines at terminal stations in Germany , Austria and Switzerland , such as at ZÃ¼rich Hauptbahnhof . An American example of a terminal with this feature is Washington , DC ' s Union Station , where there are bay platforms on the main concourse level to serve terminating trains , and standard island platforms one level below to serve trains continuing southwards . Those tracks run in a tunnel beneath the concourse and emerge a few blocks away to cross the Potomac River into Virginia . Terminus stations in large cities are by far the biggest stations , with the largest being the Grand Central Terminal in New York City , United States . [ 17 ] Often major cities , such as London , Boston , Paris , Istanbul , Tokyo and Milan have more than one terminus , rather than routes straight through the city . Train journeys through such cities often require alternative transport ( metro , bus , taxi or ferry ) from one terminus to the other . For instance in Istanbul transfers from the Sirkeci Terminal ( the European terminus ) and the HaydarpaÅa Terminal ( the Asian terminus ) traditionally required crossing the Bosphorus via alternative means , before the railway tunnel linking Europe and Asia was completed . Though some cities , including New York , have both termini and through lines . Terminals that have competing rail lines using the station frequently set up a jointly owned terminal railroad to own and operate the station and its associated tracks and switching operations . A junction is a station where two or more rail routes converge or diverge . It could be a terminus or an en-route station . During a journey , the term station stop may be used in announcements , to differentiate a halt during which passengers may alight from a halt for another reason , such as a locomotive change . A railway stop is a spot along a railway line , usually between stations or at a seldom-used station , where passengers can board and exit the train . While a junction or interlocking usually divides two or more lines or routes , and thus has remotely or locally operated signals , a station stop does not . A station stop usually does not have any tracks other than the main tracks , and may or may not have switches ( points , crossovers ) . A halt , in railway parlance in the Commonwealth of Nations and Republic of Ireland , is a small station , usually unstaffed or with very few staff , and with few or no facilities . In some cases , trains stop only on request , when passengers on the platform indicate that they wish to board , or passengers on the train inform the crew that they wish to alight . In the United Kingdom , most former halts on the national railway networks have had the word halt removed from their names . Historically , in many instances the spelling "" halte "" was used , before the spelling "" halt "" became commonplace . There are only two publicly advertised and publicly accessible National Rail stations with the word "" halt "" remaining : Coombe Junction and St Keyne Wishing Well . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] A number of other halts are still open and operational on privately owned , heritage , and preserved railways throughout the British Isles . The word is often used informally to describe national rail network stations with limited service and low usage , such as the Oxfordshire Halts on the Cotswold Line . The title halt had also sometimes been applied colloquially to stations served by public services but not available for use by the general public , being accessible only by persons travelling to / from an associated factory ( for example IBM near Greenock â although this is no longer restricted â and British Steel Redcar ) , military base ( such as Lympstone Commando ) or railway yard . The only two such remaining "" private "" stopping places on the national system where the "" halt "" designation is still officially used seem to be Staff Halt ( at Durnsford Road , Wimbledon ) and Battersea Pier Sidings Staff Halt - both are solely for railway staff and are not open to passengers . [ 19 ] The Great Western Railway in Great Britain , began opening haltes on 12 October 1903 ; from 1905 , the French spelling was Anglicised to "" halt "" . These GWR halts had the most basic facilities , with platforms long enough for just one or two carriages ; some had no platform at all , necessitating the provision of steps on the carriages . There was normally no station staff at a halt , tickets being sold on the train . On 1 September 1904 , a larger version , known on the GWR as a "" platform "" instead of a "" halt "" , was introduced ; these had longer platforms , and were usually staffed by a senior grade porter , who sold tickets , and sometimes booked parcels or milk consignments . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] From 1903 to 1947 the GWR built 379 halts and inherited a further 40 from other companies at the Grouping of 1923 . Peak building periods were before the First World War ( 145 built ) and 1928-39 ( 198 built ) [ 22 ] ) . Ten more were opened by BR on ex-GWR lines . The GWR also built 34 "" platforms "" . [ 23 ] In many Commonwealth countries the term "" halt "" is still used . In the United States such stations are traditionally referred to as flag stops . In the Republic of Ireland , a few small railway stations are designated as "" halts "" ( Irish : stadanna , sing . stad ) . [ 24 ] Accessibility for people with disabilities is mandated by law in some countries . Considerations include : elevator or ramp access to all platforms , matching platform height to train floors , making wheelchair lifts available when platforms do not match vehicle floors , accessible toilets and pay phones , audible station announcements , and safety measures such as tactile marking of platform edges . Reached by a 1 . 24-mile ( 2 km ) long tunnel , the 1830 Park Lane Goods Terminus at Liverpool's docks was the world's first station built entirely for freight . Goods or freight stations deal exclusively or predominantly with the loading and unloading of goods and may well have marshalling yards ( classification yards ) for the sorting of wagons . The world's first Goods terminal was the 1830 Park Lane Goods Station at the South End Liverpool Docks . Built in 1830 the terminal was reached by a 1 . 24-mile ( 2 km ) tunnel . As goods have been increasingly moved by road , many former goods stations , as well as the goods sheds at passenger stations , have closed . In addition , many goods stations today are used purely for the cross-loading of freight and may be known as transshipment stations . Where they primarily handle containers they are also known as container stations or terminals . Nagoya Station in Japan is the world's tallest station building . The Gare du Nord in France is Europe's busiest station . Clapham Junction , in London , United Kingdom , is the busiest station in terms of rail traffic with an average of one train every 13 seconds at peak times . The world's busiest passenger station , in terms of daily passenger throughput , is Shinjuku Station in Tokyo . [ 25 ] The station was used by an average of 3.64 million people per day in 2007 . In terms of platform capacity , the world's largest station by platforms is Grand Central Terminal in New York City with 44 platforms ; [ 28 ] as part of the East Side Access Project , the MTA will be adding 4 more platforms to accommodate future Long Island Rail Road trains . The world's highest station above ground level ( not above sea level ) is Smith â Ninth Streets subway station in New York City . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The Shinjuku Station , in Tokyo , is Asia's busiest station by total passenger numbers . [ citation needed ] The Shinjuku Station , in Tokyo , is Asia's largest station by number of platforms [ citation needed ] Clapham Junction , in London , is Europe's busiest station by daily rail traffic ( one train every 13 seconds at peak times ; one train every 30 seconds at off-peak times ) .

246	"Sixth session Geneva , 17-21 June 2002 The sixth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for an International Legally Binding Instrument for Persistent Organic Pollutants was held at the Geneva International Conference Centre , Geneva , from 17 to 21 June 2002 . The session was opened by Mr. John Buccini ( Canada ) , Chair of the Committee , at 10.30 a . m . on Monday , 17 June 2002 . An opening statement was made by Mr. Philippe Roch , State Secretary , Director of the Swiss Agency for the Environment , Forests and Landscape . In his statement Mr. Roch said that persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) present a problem of global dimension which called for concerted efforts on a global scale . In that regard , several remaining problems needed to be discussed and resolved , such as the question of technical assistance for capacity-building . An efficient way had to be found to evaluate the specific needs of different regions and subregions and the transfer of technology required by developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition . In order to respond to the needs of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants , and to those of the Convention to Combat Desertification , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , which had been designated as the financial mechanism , must have the necessary funds at its disposal , without reducing its means of intervention in other areas , namely climate and biodiversity . He said that to enable both Conventions to enter into force it was necessary that contributions to GEF be increased . KMON On the issue of enhancing the synergies and linkages between multilateral environmental agreements , as a means of strengthening international environmental governance , Mr. Roch welcomed the fact that the Stockholm Convention called for the Conference of the Parties to collaborate closely with the competent entities of the Basel Convention to determine methods to ensure environmentally appropriate disposal . He singled out the excellent collaboration in Geneva between the Basel , Stockholm and Rotterdam Conventions , which strengthens the coordination of the activities taking place within the framework of those agreements . Turning to the issue of the permanent secretariat for the Stockholm Convention , Mr. Roch said that the existing infrastructure in Switzerland and the potential synergies with other international organizations directly related to chemicals would offer the future secretariat ideal working conditions that would be strengthened by the presence of 140 permanent missions and numerous environmental non-governmental organizations located in Geneva . He said that Switzerland would be honoured to welcome the seventh session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee in Geneva . Mr. Jim Willis , Executive Secretary of the Stockholm Convention presented the opening statement on behalf of Mr. Klaus TÃ¶pfer , Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) . Mr. Willis conveyed the apologies of Mr. TÃ¶pfer , who was unable to attend the current meeting . He presented Mr. TÃ¶pfer's address to the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee , noting in particular the contribution of the Stockholm Convention to sustainable development ; the major issues to be addressed by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee at its sixth session ; and the budget shortfall of the secretariat . Mr. TÃ¶pfer also congratulated the 151 countries that had signed the Convention as well the 11 Governments that had thus far ratified or acceded to it . Attendance The session was attended by representatives of the following Parties : Algeria , Antigua and Barbuda , Argentina , Armenia , Australia , Austria , Azerbaijan , Bahamas , Bahrain , Bangladesh , Belarus , Belgium , Benin , Bhutan , Bolivia , Brazil , Bulgaria , Burkina Faso , Burundi , Cambodia , Canada , Central African Republic , Chad , Chile , China , Colombia , Comoros , Costa Rica , CÃ´te d ' Ivoire , Croatia , Cuba , Czech Republic , Denmark , Djibouti , Dominican Republic , Ecuador , Egypt , Ethiopia , Fiji , Finland , France , Gabon , Gambia , Georgia , Germany , Ghana , Greece , Guatemala , Guinea , Hungary , Iceland , India , Indonesia , Iran ( Islamic Republic of ) , Iraq , Italy , Jamaica , Japan , Jordan , Kazakhstan , Kenya , Kiribati , Kuwait , Kyrgyzstan , Latvia , Lesotho , Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , Liechtenstein , Lithuania , Madagascar , Malawi , Malaysia , Mauritania , Mauritius , Mexico , Monaco , Mongolia , Morocco , Mozambique , Myanmar , Netherlands , New Zealand , Nicaragua , Nigeria , Niue , Norway , Oman , Panama , Paraguay , Peru , Philippines , Poland , Portugal , Qatar , Republic of Korea , Republic of Moldova , Romania , Russian Federation , Rwanda , St. Lucia , Samoa , Saudi Arabia , Senegal , Seychelles , Singapore , Slovakia , Slovenia , South Africa , Spain , Sudan , Suriname , Sweden , Switzerland , Syrian Arab Republic , Tajikistan , Thailand , The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Togo , Trinidad and Tobago , Tunisia , Uganda , Ukraine , United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , United Republic of Tanzania , United States of America , Uruguay , Uzbekistan , Venezuela , Yemen , Yugoslavia , Zambia , Zimbabwe . The following United Nations bodies , specialized agencies and convention secretariats were represented : Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) , United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ( UNECE ) , United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , United Nations Institute for Training and Research ( UNITAR ) , World Bank , World Health Organization ( WHO ) , World Meteorological Organization , World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , secretariat of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal , secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity , secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and / or Desertification , particularly in Africa and the interim secretariat for the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade The following intergovernmental organizations and other bodies were represented : European Commission ( EC ) , Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety ( IFCS ) , League of Arab States ( LAS ) , South Pacific Regional Environment Programme ( SPREP ) , ABB Environmental Services , Aptechnologies , Dongbu Honnong Chemical ( DHC ) , Federation of Thai Industries ( FTI ) , Royal Entomological Society , Trent University The following non-governmental organizations and other bodies were represented : AC-DASSUR Africa Fighting Malaria ( AFM ) , American Chemistry Council ( ACC ) , Armenian Women for Health and a Healthy Environment ( AWHHE ) , ARNIKA , Berne Declaration , Center for International Environmental Law ( CIEL ) , Centro de Derecho Ambiental del Sur , AC-DASSUR , Climate and Development Initiative , s ( CDI ) , Comisiones Obreras , ComitÃ© Sahelien des Pesticides ( CSP ) , Eco-Accord Center for Environment and Sustainable Development , Environment Quality Protection Foundations ( EQPF ) , European Chemical Industry Council ( CEFIC ) , Federation of Thai Industries ( FTI ) , Greenpeace International , Indigenous Environmental Network ( IEN ) , International Council of Chemical Associations ( ICCA ) , International Council of Environmental Law ( ICEL ) , International POPs Elimination Network ( IPEN ) , Japan Chemical Industry Association ( JCIA ) , Japan Offspring Fund ( JOF ) , Mouvement pour les Droits et le Respect des GÃ©nÃ©rations Futures , National Toxics Network ( NTN ) , Oekometric GmbH ( the Bayreuth Institute of Environmental Research ) , People's Task Force for Bases Clean-up , Pesticide Action Network ( PAN ) , Physicians for Social Responsibility ( PSR ) , Thanal Conservation Action and Information Network , World Chlorine Council ( WCC ) , World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) . Officers Introducing the item , the Chair informed the meeting of the death of Mr. Mir Jafar Ghaemieh who had served as Vice-Chair for the Asia and Pacific region . The Chair made particular reference to the constructive contribution made by Mr. Ghaemieh throughout the negotiations . The Chair also drew the Committee's attention to the note prepared by the secretariat ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 2 ) on the subject of Bureau issues , which contained a proposal submitted by the Group of 77 and China to the effect that rule 8 of the rules of procedure of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee should be revised with a view to increasing the membership of the Bureau to 10 members . Further to clarifications provided by the sponsors of the proposal , the Committee decided to amend rule 8 of the rules of procedure to state that : "" 1 . The Committee shall elect from among the representatives of the State Parties a Bureau composed of one Chair and nine Vice-Chairs , one of whom shall act as Rapporteur . "" 2 . In electing the officers , the Committee shall have due regard to the principle of equitable geographical representation . Each of the five regional groups shall be represented by two members . "" Decision INC-6 / 1 on the amendment of rule 8 of the rules of procedure for the meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee is contained in annex I to the present report . A number of representatives stressed that they agreed to the expansion of the Bureau , on the understanding that it did not constitute a precedent either for the organizational structure of the Conference of the Parties or for other multilateral environmental agreements . It was also stressed that the increased number of Bureau members would not cause a budget increase . In view of the above-mentioned decision , and taking into consideration the absence at the current session of previously elected Bureau members for the Africa region and the Latin America and Caribbean region , as well as the recent demise of the Bureau member from the Asia and Pacific region , the elected members of the Bureau of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee at its sixth session were as follows : Chair : Mr. John Buccini ( Canada ) Vice-Chairs : Mr. Mahi Boumediene ( Algeria ) Mr. Manfred Schneider ( Austria ) Mr. Yue Ruisheng ( China ) Ms. Darka Hamel ( Croatia ) Ms. Fatoumata Jallow NDoye Ndoye ( Gambia ) Mr. Seyed Reza Tabatabaei ( Iran , Islamic Republic of ) Mr. TomÃ¡s Guardia ( Panama ) Ms. Natalia Karpova ( Russian Federation ) Mr. Gonzalo Casas ( Uruguay ) In accordance with rule 8 of the Committee's rules of procedure , Ms. Hamel , Vice-Chair , also agreed to continue as rapporteur . C. Adoption of the agenda The Committee adopted the following agenda on the basis of the provisional agenda , which had been circulated as document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 1 : Opening of the session . Organizational matters : ( a ) Adoption of the agenda ; ( b ) Organization of work ; ( c ) Report by the secretariat on intersessional work requested by the Committee or the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants ; ( d ) Bureau issues . Review of ongoing international activities relating to the work of the Committee . Activities of the secretariat and review of the situation as regards extrabudgetary funds . Preparation for the Conference of the Parties . Other matters . Adoption of the report . Closure of the session . Organization of work At its opening session , the Committee decided to work in plenary and to establish contact groups on an as-needed basis . The Committee took note of the election of Ms. Anne Daniels ( Canada ) as the new chair of the legal drafting group . E. E. Report by the secretariat on intersessional work requested by the Committee or the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants The secretariat noted that , while no specific intersessional work had been requested by the Committee at its fifth session , considerable work had been undertaken intersessionally as a result of the resolutions ensuing from the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Stockholm Convention . In addition to the reports of both the fifth session of the Committee ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 5 / 7 ) and the Conference of Plenipotentiaries ( UNEP / POPS / CONF / 4 ) , the secretariat had produced a booklet containing the text of the Stockholm Convention and the documentation for the current session of the Committee . A full list of the documents available to the Committee is provided in annex IX to the present report . At its opening session , the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee took up consideration of the above item . Introducing the item , the secretariat drew the Committee's attention to the relevant documentation available ( see annex IX )) Mr. Willis , speaking as Executive Secretary , said that the fourth edition of the master list of actions on the reduction and / or elimination of the release of POPs ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 10 ) , prepared by the secretariat , contained input from over 100 countries . Because of the volume of material , and for reasons of economy , the document was being made available in CD-ROM format , which would be the practice for all such lengthy information documents in the future , perhaps with additional interactive features . Hard-copy versions would also be available to those who required them . Mr. Willis , speaking on behalf of UNEP Chemicals , briefly summarized some of the capacity-building activities of UNEP in the intersessional period , as set out in document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 17 . He expressed appreciation to the Governments of Canada , Denmark , Germany , Sweden , Switzerland and the United States , as well as to GEF , World Bank and the Inuit Circumpolar Conference for their assistance in the financing of POPs-related workshops , and also thanked the countries that had hosted those workshops for their in-kind contributions and efforts . The representative of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research ( UNITAR ) described the relevant activities of UNITAR , as set out in document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 27 , and highlighted its programmes to assist in : the development of national chemicals management profiles ; skills-building training for sound management of chemicals ; risk management decision-making for priority chemicals ; and developing integrated national programmes for the sound management of chemicals . The representative of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) said that the UNIDO General Conference and the Industrial Development Board recognized the importance of priority action on POPs . UNIDO had received a number of requests for assistance from countries , which had been and were being submitted to GEF and other donors for funding , inter alia , for capacity-building and technical assistance on best available techniques ( BAT ) for POPs reductions and on substitutes for POPs . Ms. Sachiko Kuwabara-Yamamoto , Executive Secretary of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal , reporting on the status of preparation of the technical guidelines for the environmentally sound management of POPs as wastes , said that a first draft was expected in November 2002 , and work was continuing on the revised technical guidelines for PCBs , PCTs and PBBs . Concerning the regional centres for training and technology transfer of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal , the Working Group for Implementation had at its recent first session prepared , for the upcoming sixth meeting of the Conference of the Parties , a draft decision on strengthening their legal status . Welcoming the workshops organized by the Stockholm Convention at the Basel regional centres and the proposal to develop pilot regional and subregional centres to provide technical assistance under article 12 of the Stockholm Convention , she stressed that such involvement in the centres could strengthen their viability , avoid duplication and enhance the collaboration between the two Conventions . The representative of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ( UNECE ) , speaking on behalf of the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution , reported on activities under its protocol on POPs , which was expected to enter into force by the end of 2002 . Monitoring and evaluation activities under that protocol involved , inter alia , emissions inventories , methodologies and modelling work , and evaluation of the effects of POPs and their health risks . An expert group on POPs was focusing on issues of the scheduled reassessment of certain POPs , and attention was being given to potential candidate POPs . He underlined the continued interest of UNECE in furthering collaboration with UNEP . The representative of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) drew attention to document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 26 which highlighted WHO activities to reduce or eliminate POPs . He drew special attention to the overall WHO policy regarding POPs , progress in POPs-related activities and programmes , and progress in implementing the WHO action plan for the reduction of reliance on DDT in disease vector control . The representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) drew attention to document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 24 which highlighted relevant FAO programmes and publications , including the "" International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides ; "" guidelines on Integrated Pest Management ( IPM ) and Integrated Vector Management ( IVM ) , produced with the Global IPM Facility , UNEP and WHO ; the "" Prevention and Disposal of Obsolete Pesticides "" programme ; and the new cooperative Africa Stockpile Programme . The representative of the secretariat of the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure on Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade informed the Committee on the successful operation of the Interim Chemical Review Committee . He also reported that in response to country requests , a series of workshops had been held or were planned for 2002 to provide practical hands-on training in the operational elements of the Rotterdam Convention . Representatives of the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety ( IFCS ) drew attention to document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 21 and outlined the Information Exchange Network on Capacity Building for the Sound Management of Chemicals ( INFOCAP ) . They explained that INFOCAP was a web-based information exchange network designed to enhance effective cooperation among countries and organizations providing and / or receiving assistance related to the sound management of chemicals , including information on : national profiles , priorities , plans of action and related needs ; sources of potential support ; past , ongoing and planned projects ; a reference library of existing training and guidance documents ; and contact points . A representative of the World Bank reported that under a trust fund established by the Government of Canada , the World Bank had undertaken work to help countries develop their capacity to implement the Convention effectively . The World Bank had also developed a number of related materials , including document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 8 , prepared with UNEP , on the development of national implementation plans . With regard to international activity by other intergovernmental organizations , a representative of the secretariat drew attention to document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 20 on the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships of the International Maritime Organization and document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 22 on the International Whaling Commission's resolution on the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants . Many representatives reported on activities within their countries relating to the work of the Committee and provisional implementation of the Stockholm Convention , including : signing and ratification of the Convention ; development of national implementation plans ; capacity-building ; stakeholder participation ; regulatory developments ; programmes to reduce or eliminate the use or release of specific POPs , eliminate obsolete stockpiles of pesticides , control and disposal of POPs contaminated wastes , and address contaminated sites ; regional and subregional workshops ; monitoring and assessment of POPs , their long-range transport and their impacts on the environment and human health ; identification and assessment of potential candidate POPs ; ensuring synergistic cooperation among the Stockholm , Rotterdam and Basel Convention secretariats ; the effective utilization of financial and technical assistance ; programmes developed in collaboration with bilateral donors , UNEP Chemicals , the Stockholm , Rotterdam and Basel Convention secretariats , Basel Convention regional technical centres , GEF , the World Bank and other institutions ; and financial contributions toward the work of the Committee and national and international implementation of the Convention . A summary of statements made by representatives of non-governmental organizations is contained in annex VIII to the present report . Introducing the item , the Executive Secretary drew attention to the documentation prepared on the subject ( see annex IX )) and elaborated on the main points raised therein . He expressed gratitude to those donors that had made pledges to the POPs Club . He stressed that , with the 29.3 per cent reduction in the allocation to UNEP Chemicals from the Environment Fund , the in-kind support provided by UNEP in the past now had to be costed and financed . The secretariat of the Stockholm Convention thus depends entirely upon the level of funding of the voluntary POPs Club , which currently displayed a downward trend compared with previous years . It was noted that UNEP expected that the outstanding balance of the loan from the Environment Fund reserve of US $ 818,241 would be repaid . The secretariat was not eligible to receive direct funding from GEF , and existing trust funds were usually earmarked for specific programme activities . Many representatives , expressing concern at the decline in the level of contributions to the POPs Club , called upon Governments and non-governmental organizations , including industry , to make a sustained effort and commitment towards supporting the POPs Club . A number of representatives , pointing to the 2003-2004 priorities listed in the proposed budget , called on the secretariat to prepare a more detailed breakdown of the activities coming under each priority area , including the proposed budgetary allocation for each activity . In addition , in light of the possibility of a budget shortfall , the secretariat was requested to prepare a paper to provide details of the impact on activities in the event that receipts are less than the 2002 budget . One representative saw merit in the budget proposed by the secretariat and supported its adoption . Another representative questioned where the funding would come from to underpin such a budget , if approved . The following representatives announced their Governments' intention to make contributions to the POPs Club for 2002 : Australia , US $ 31,157 ; Finland , 20,000 Euros ; Japan , US $ 100,000 ; and Luxembourg , US $ 8,033 . The representative of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference also announced her organization's donation of CAN $ 1 , 000 to the POPs Club , a sum which represented a large proportion of the Inuit communities' funding for all POPs issues . Some representatives , noting the uncertain financial situation , considered that a draft budget only for 2003 should be approved , with purely notional proposals for 2004 . In answer to a suggestion that Governments be called upon to offset secretariat staffing costs by means of staff secondments , the secretariat explained that , while such a practice was very welcome , seconded staff often came from one particular regional group , and that over reliance on secondments could affect the regional balance of the composition of the secretariat . In answer to a query , the secretariat clarified that the budgetary implications of the capacity assistance network , as set out in document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 19 , were not included in the budget proposed by the secretariat , and would need to be considered separately . The Committee agreed that , in the course of its consideration of the items on its agenda , the special financial implications of adoption or deletion of any of the proposed activities would be discussed . The outcome would then be reflected in a report of running costs to be prepared by the secretariat . The Executive Secretary introduced a conference room paper containing details of the proposed 2003-2004 budget and an overview of the potential impacts of funding shortfalls in 2002 . He also reported on the additional impact of the decisions taken by the Committee at its current meeting , which were not yet reflected in the document . He noted that the cumulative impact of the decisions adopted at the current meeting was to increase the 2003 budget by US $ 300,000 . The Committee agreed to note the budget for the year 2003 , on the understanding that the budget for 2004 would be indicative only and would be further examined in detail by the Committee at its seventh session . The secretariat was requested to provide the Committee at its seventh session with a report on the actual expenditures on budget items , based on the figures set out in the current draft budget . The budget for 2003 and the indicative budget for 2004 are contained in annex VI to the present report . The Committee also agreed to establish a budget group at the seventh session of the Committee , which would also be able to examine the possible budgetary implications of the Committee's decisions and report on them . The secretariat was requested to prepare , in advance of the seventh session of the Committee , an information paper compiling the reports used in other multilateral environmental agreements for dealing with their budgets . In light of the fact that a large proportion of the draft budget was a debt to the Environment Fund reserve , the Committee requested the Executive Secretary to request the Executive Director of UNEP to examine the possibility of retiring some or all of that debt . Noting that the draft budget also required a 13 per cent overhead charge to be paid to UNEP , the Committee called for an examination of the possibility of reducing those costs or of UNEP providing a Finance Officer under that allocation . Precedents for such a course of action existed under other multilateral agreements . One representative said that the future budget group should consider the high level of effectiveness of the secretariat in carrying out activities and its excellent budget management , and examine the advantages that could accrue to developing countries from interaction with the secretariat . The Committee took note of the detailed information on programme priorities and budget for 2003-2004 provided by the secretariat which may be found in annex VI to the present report . Measures to reduce or eliminate releases from intentional production and use and Register of specific exemptions ( Articles 3 and 4 , and Annex A and Annex B ) In its deliberations , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing the item , the secretariat drew attention to possible action by the Committee set out in the note by the secretariat on work on DDT ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 5 , paragraphs 4 and 5 ) . Several representatives pointed to the efforts underway in their countries to reduce reliance on DDT and apply alternatives . One representative offered to exchange information on the experiences and problems encountered in that endeavour . It was stressed that alternative means of vector control needed to be analysed to determine whether they were easily applicable in developing countries and whether they cost no more than the current use of DDT . One representative said that , despite tremendous work , her Government had not been able to identify an economically viable substitute for DDT . She wondered whether WHO could work in close collaboration with her country to develop an economically viable alternative and a format for registering DDT , to be submitted to the Conference of the Parties at its first meeting . In light of the large quantities of DDT produced by her country , the identification of an alternative would have great repercussions . Another representative said that a national debate was underway in her country to determine whether it should revoke the 1996 ban on the use of DDT and revert to its use for vector control , since alternatives had not had the desired effect . She sought advice from WHO before such a major decision could be taken . Another representative requested WHO to start a process of communication and discussion with the countries with a DDT use exemption , to inform them of developments and progress in the identification and application of alternatives . One representative , speaking on behalf of a regional economic integration organization and its member States and supported by another representative , welcomed the proposals for possible action set out in the secretariat's note on DDT and encouraged increased cooperation between UNEP and WHO . He also suggested that the secretariat consider all documents and work undertaken by non-governmental organizations on the subject . He believed that research activities in the field should be increased , in order to promote and develop alternative vector control methods and strategies and achieve the elimination of DDT . He proposed that the secretariat consider the information to be included in the DDT Register established in annex B , part II , paragraph 1 and prepare a format of the DDT Register , to be presented for discussion to the Committee at its seventh session . He also asked the secretariat and WHO to start work to develop the format for reporting by the Parties referred to under paragraph 4 of annex B , part II . The information to be gathered in a Party's report might include , inter alia , monitoring data on human exposure to DDT ; public health impacts of DDT reduction ; production , storage and usage of DDT ; efficacy and appropriateness of DDT in areas where it continued to be used ; and efficacy and appropriateness of alternatives to DDT . On the basis of the deliberations the Committee agreed that further consideration of the matter was necessary and requested the secretariat to prepare a report on a possible format for reporting by Parties that use DDT on amounts used , conditions of such use and its relevance in disease management strategies , as well as a report on guidance and information needed to assist the Conference of the Parties in evaluating the continued need for DDT for disease vector control and submit both reports to the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for further consideration at its seventh session . Decision INC-6 / 2 on DDT , is contained in annex I to the present report . Register of specific exemptions In its deliberations , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing the item , the secretariat said that , in addition to the elements of the process as specified in the Convention , and listed in the note by the secretariat ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 4 , paragraph 5 ) , there might be other possible elements . He also drew attention to the possible action by the Committee set out in the note by the secretariat ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 4 , paragraphs 7 and 8 ) . One representative , speaking on behalf of a regional economic integration organization and its member States , underscored the need to eliminate the chemicals listed in annexes A and B of the Convention and hoped that , eventually , no exemptions would be required , except in extraordinary cases . While the rules and criteria for such exemptions should be as strict as possible , it was necessary to bear in mind the specific circumstances and needs of the developing countries and the countries with economies in transition . He suggested that the secretariat should prepare , for submission to the Committee at its seventh session , a set of guidelines and criteria for the granting of a temporary exemption to a Party and for the extension of exemptions . While one representative called for the establishment of a technical group to conduct the review process , another representative considered that the creation of a subsidiary body for the process was premature , since it was dependent on the number of requests for exemptions and renewals that were yet to be received . One representative observed that efforts to develop guidance should start with a request for input s from countries , which could be compiled by the secretariat and discussed at the seventh session of the Committee . Expressing the view that the Committee should not become involved in the policy aspects of the review process , since the need for and nature of any such criteria should be developed based on the experience and deliberations of the Conference of the Parties , he considered that the focus should be on the logistical and process aspects , such as those set out in the note by the secretariat , and including the timing of the submission of the exemption extension request to the secretariat . Annex F provided a good example of the kinds of information countries should include in their reports justifying an exemptionextension Another representative stressed the need for countries to provide information on the maximum quantities of the chemical substances that would be produced and used under the proposed exemption extension A number of representatives proposed amendments to the draft format of the Register of specific exemptions attached to document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 6 . One considered that the footnotes thereto should not generate any extra legal obligations under the Stockholm Convention . Another representative , speaking on behalf of a regional economic integration organization and its member States , said that footnotes 4 and 8 should use the agreed terminology of the Stockholm Convention , and footnote 9 should be deleted . One representative said that the secretariat should develop a unified format for notifications pursuant to note ( ii ) of annexes A and B of the Convention . One representative , considering that the "" remarks "" column was useful for providing additional information on the scope of the exemption for countries , said that a footnote was needed to clarify the types of information to be put in that column . The Register should also contain specific information about the nature of the exemptions . The Committee decided to request the secretariat to further prepare a report on : a possible format for country reporting of requests for specific exemptions , a possible process that might be considered by the Conference of the Parties , as well as a possible format for a Register of specific exemptions to be submitted to the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for further consideration at its seventh session . Decision INC-6 / 3 , on the Register of specific exemptions ( Articles 3 and 4 and Annexes A and B ) , is contained in annex I to the present report . Measures to reduce or eliminate releases from unintentional production ( article 5 and Annex C ) In its deliberations , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing the item , the representative of the secretariat drew attention to the note on guidance on best available techniques ( BAT ) and best environmental practices ( BEP ) ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 7 ) and enumerated the points raised therein . He also drew attention to a conference room paper containing the report of a regional workshop on national action on measures to reduce or eliminate the releases of by-products from unintentional production , held in Bangkok from 13 to 15 March 2002 and organized by the Governments of Germany and Thailand , in cooperation with UNEP Chemicals . Stressing the highly technical nature of the issues involved in providing guidance on BAT and BEP for the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties , which called for specialized expertise , he said that the Committee might wish to consider establishing a subsidiary body to assist it in that effort . Because of the budgetary implications , the costs of the different options within the process chosen would also need to be carefully assessed . One representative , speaking on behalf of a regional economic integration organization and its member States , welcomed the outcome of the regional workshop held in Thailand and pointed to a conference room paper on BAT and BEP for reducing and / or eliminating emissions of by-product POPs , submitted by his organization and its member States . He considered that there was a need to initiate the establishment of a process for the development of BAT and BEP that might include the creation of a technical working group and the organization of a workshop . Measures to reduce or eliminate release from unintentional production of chemicals listed in annex C of the Stockholm Convention , including measures to promote BAT and BEP , must be included in national implementation plans . He expressed the hope that the secretariat would emphasize the promotion of effective information exchange , which could be facilitated by the experience gained through his organization's directive on integrated pollution and prevention control . Several representatives , referring to the possibility of establishing a contact group to consider how to proceed on the issue , stressed the need for all participants to have the opportunity to play an active part in its deliberations , particularly the developing countries , since BAT and BEP were directly linked to the subject of emissions and thus affected their industries . Some representatives noted that it was essential to have BAT and BEP guidelines that would be useful to countries at all levels of development , so it was necessary to ensure that a balance of countries at all levels of development participate in the guidance development process . One representative , pointing to a conference room paper submitted by his Government on the development of guidelines on BAT and BEP , considered that work on the issue was very timely and needed to be initiated soon . It was very important to have a contact group convene to discuss the terms of reference of any subsidiary body to be established on BAT and BEP . The Committee decided to establish an open-ended contact group , co-chaired by Mr. Sergio Vives ( Chile ) and Mr. Robert Kellam ( United States ) , with a mandate to address issues of guidelines on BAT and guidance on BEP pursuant to article 5 of the Stockholm Convention , as set out in the note by the secretariat ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 7 ) . The contact group was to propose a way forward with regard to acquiring the expertise needed and formulating the guidelines and guidance for adoption by the Conference of the Parties . Mr. Robert Kellam , The co-chairs of the contact group , speaking also on behalf of co-chair Sergio Vives , reported to plenary on the results of the deliberations of the group , which were before the Committee in a conference room paper . He They drew particular attention to the need for a decision at the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties on whether to continue work on the subject using the current methodology or whether to establish another group . Following discussion on the item , the Committee adopted the terms of reference for the Expert Group on BAT / BEP contained in annex VII to the present report . The Committee selected Mr. Sergio Vives ( Chile ) and Mr. Robert Kellem Kellam ( United States ) to serve as interim co-Chairs of the Expert Group for the purpose of facilitating the first meeting of the Group . The Committee noted that Algeria , Chile , Gabon , Iran ( Islamic Republic of ) , Kenya , Mongolia , Nigeria , Saudi Arabia and Zambia would serve as nine of the 15 members of the Group from developing countries . For the remaining six positions , Iran would inform the secretariat of the identities of two countries from the Asia and Pacific region and the Dominican Republic would inform the secretariat of the identities of four countries from the Latin American and Caribbean region . The Committee noted that Kazakhstan , Poland and Yugoslavia would serve as the three members from countries with economies in transition . The Committee noted that Australia and the country occupying the presidency of the European Union would inform the secretariat of the identities of the 18 countries that would serve as members from developed countries . In its deliberation of guidance on the evaluation of current and projected releases of chemicals listed in annex C , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing the item , the secretariat noted the UNEP Standardized Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Dioxin and Furan Releases . This Toolkit was now being used by 14 countries , with funding being identified for its use in a further three countries . The generous financial and other support of the Governments of Canada , Denmark , Germany , Switzerland and the United States as well as the Arctic Council Assessment Programme was acknowledged . A number of representatives spoke very favourably on the usefulness of the Toolkit . Representatives observed that the Toolkit was a good basis for provisional guidance but ultimately needed to be more detailed and that a strategy for proper identification of all sources should be included . It was further noted that currently emissions factors should be useable by developed countries , developing countries and countries with economies in transition . Representatives noted that the Toolkit would perhaps need to address new sources , as well as all of the unintentionally produced POPs in annex C of the Convention . It was noted that more references and more detail would also be useful . The Committee agreed that an update of the Toolkit should be prepared by the secretariat taking into account comments and input to be received from Governments and others by 31 December 2002 as well as the experiences of those countries using the Toolkit . That update would be presented for discussion at the seventh session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee and then forwarded as appropriate to the Conference of the Parties to serve as guidance once the Convention entered into force . Decision INC-6 / 4 , on the evaluation of current and projected releases of chemicals listed in annex C is contained in annex I to the present report . C. Measures to reduce or eliminate releases from stockpiles and wastes ( Article 6 ) In its deliberations , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) . Introducing the item , the secretariat observed that the Committee might wish to take note of the information papers before it , and might further wish to comment on the cooperative activities undertaken with the Basel Convention and on possible further areas of cooperation . A number of representatives welcomed the progress made by the Technical Working Group of the Basel Convention in the preparation of technical guidelines for the environmentally sound management of POPs wastes and encouraged cooperation with the Basel Convention secretariat in the process of their finalization , considering this activity to be of high priority . One representative was of the view that technical experts from the Stockholm Convention should be enabled to participate in the process of drafting these guidelines to the same extent as Parties to the Basel Convention , and through their attendance at its technical meetings , despite the fact that not all interested countries were Parties to the Basel Convention . It was noted that advantage should be taken of the possibility for stakeholders to submit comments on the technical guidelines by 15 September 2002 . One representative , speaking on behalf of a regional economic integration organization and its member States said that , once the technical guidelines had been finalized , the secretariat should study them to see their implications for the Stockholm Convention , and should draft recommendations for the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties concerning those elements of the guidelines that could be adopted as legal provisions under the Convention . He also encouraged cooperation with the Basel Convention in the revision of the technical guidelines on PCBs , PCTs and PBBs . Pointing to the recently approved Basel Convention technical guidelines for the dismantling of ships , which were to be submitted to the Conference of the Parties at its sixth meeting , in December 2002 , he noted the possibility that such activities could involve releases of POPs , and said that his organization would monitor the situation to see if the safeguards were at the level required by the provisions of the Stockholm Convention . Many representatives welcomed the current cooperation at the institutional level between the secretariats of the Basel Convention and the Stockholm Convention and encouraged an increase in such cooperation in other areas , particularly capacity-building , implementing and reporting . Several representatives said that such cooperation should also be extended at the national level on matters related to the two Conventions . One representative , pointing to the evidence of good cooperation to date between the Basel Convention and the Stockholm Convention , expressed strong support for the clustering of the secretariats of chemicals and wastes-related multilateral environmental agreements . The Committee invited the Conference of the Parties of the Basel Convention to consider inviting experts from the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to participate in the process related to preparing the technical guidelines on POPs waste . The Committee also invited the secretariat to make an analysis of the compiled technical guidelines on POPs and prepare a report for the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties , with guidance on what elements of the technical guidelines should be adopted as legal provisions of the Stockholm Convention . Decision INC-6 / 5 on measures to reduce or eliminate releases from stockpiles and wastes : development of technical guidelines on the environmentally sound management of persistent organic pollutant wastes , is contained in annex I to the present report . National implementation plans ( Article 7 ) In its deliberations , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing the item , the secretariat suggested that the Committee might wish to consider whether there was a need , first , to prepare guidance relevant to review and updating , as appropriate , of national implementation plans for consideration by the Conference of the Parties and , second , to prepare interim guidance to countries to assist in the development of those national implementation plans in the interim period . In the latter context , the secretariat referred to a guidance document being developed in the context of a GEF-supported pilot project executed in 12 countries by UNEP with in-kind support from the World Bank and the Government of Denmark . In addition , guidelines for enabling activities had been prepared by GEF prior to the adoption of the Stockholm Convention and recent decisions of the GEF Council , and which had been used as a basis for developing national implementation plans to date . Further clarification on the guidelines prepared for enabling activities was provided by the GEF representative who noted that the guidelines would be revised to take into account the final text of the Stockholm Convention . He added that there were 64 developing countries or countries with economies in transition receiving or about to receive funding to prepare national implementation plans . Representatives noted the importance of having national implementation plans that would ensure efficient compliance with the obligations of the Convention . While guidance for preparing those plans would ensure consistency and inclusion of key elements , representatives emphasized that it should not be prescriptive but rather flexible and dynamic , taking into account the different environmental , economic and political commitments of countries . The necessity of considering both developing and developed country situations and the need for a transparent process was also stressed . The Committee wished to see incorporated into the guidance the experiences of countries that were preparing or had implemented national implementation plans , including the 12 pilot countries , as well as experiences gained from other multilateral environmental agreements , especially chemical agreements . The Committee requested the secretariat to prepare guidance relevant to the review and updating of national implementation plans for consideration by the Conference of the Parties . The Committee also requested the secretariat to prepare interim guidance to assist countries to develop their national implementation plans and take into account written comments from Governments that should be received no later than 31 October 2002 . A revised interim guidance document would be submitted to the Committee for consideration at its seventh session . Decision INC-6 / 6 the development of interim guidance to assist countries in the preparation of national implementation plans and guidance for reviewing and updating national implementation plans , is contained in annex I to the present report . E. Listing of chemicals in annexes A , B and C ( Article 8 , annexes D , E and F , and paragraph 6 of article 19 ) In its deliberations , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing the item , the secretariat , pointing to the anticipated rapid rate of ratification of the Convention , underlined the need for clear guidance to be given at the current meeting on the draft rules of procedure , composition and operational guidelines for the functioning of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee . Although it was possible to request the secretariat to prepare a set of such draft elements for future submission to the Committee , in light of the time factor , it was perhaps more desirable to establish a contact group at the current meeting to develop relevant recommendations concerning the POPs Review Committee , for consideration by the Conference of the Parties at its first meeting . One representative , speaking as Chair of the Interim Chemical Review Committee of the Rotterdam Convention , underlined the importance of ensuring that suitably qualified experts were selected by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee . Under the Rotterdam Convention , the experts worked mainly intersessionally , through e-mail , and in English only , in order to draft the decision guidance documents . Transparency was ensured by attaching to the translated reports of the Interim Chemical Review Committee the rationale behind a decision to list a chemical , and submitting the translated draft decision guidance documents to Parties six months prior to a meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee . One representative , speaking on behalf of a regional economic integration organization and its member States , considered that the Interim Chemical Review Committee of the Rotterdam Convention was an appropriate starting point for the development of the rules of procedure , which could be amended according to the needs of the Stockholm Convention , ensuring the efficient , timely and effective operation of the POPs Review Committee and its conduct of a step-wise procedure . In order to ensure flexible and transparent procedures , the meetings of the POPs Review Committee should be open to observers and the Committee should be able to establish subgroups to provide specialist advice to assist its work . The POPs Review Committee should be able to make recommendations to the Conference of the Parties regarding its own functioning , as well as guidance which might be established by the Conference of the Parties . He expressed a readiness to start work to enable the adoption of the rules of procedure by the Conference of the Parties at its first meeting . Another representative , expressing support for that position , noted that the list of examples of technical subsidiary bodies contained in the information paper prepared by the secretariat ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 4 ) was not exhaustive , and that the operational aspects of other bodies could also be taken into account , such as the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer . In addition , he considered that , while the secretariat's paper provided a quantitative analysis of the operations of the subsidiary bodies listed , what was needed was a qualitative analysis , setting out the advantages and disadvantages that had been encountered as they performed their functions . The Committee decided to establish an open-ended contact group , to be co-chaired by Mr. Reiner Arndt ( Germany ) and Ms. Fatoumata Jallow NDoye Ndoye ( Gambia ) , with a mandate to consider issues of the terms of reference , operational guidelines and rules of procedure for the POPs Review Committee , and to report to plenary on the results of its work . Reporting to plenary on the results of the deliberations of the contact group , co-chair Reiner Arndt pointed to a conference room paper containing the report of the contact group and noted that it had not reached agreement on the question of what was meant by "" equitable geographical distribution "" , which the contact group agreed to put to the UNEP legal counsel / legal drafting group . Co-chair Fatoumata Jallow NDoye Ndoye highlighted the contact groups ' group's view that , due to the expected workload , either co-chairs or vice-chairs could be used . On that issue , the group had considered that the Conference of the Parties be given flexibility to decide , and the issue could be raised with the legal drafting group in its consideration of the draft rules of procedure for the Conference of the Parties . The Committee took note of the report of the contact group and requested the secretariat to use the report as the basis to propose a brief description and draft terms of reference for the subsidiary body to review candidate POPs for further consideration by the Committee at its seventh session . The report of the contact group is contained in annex V to the present report . Information exchange ( Article 9 ) In its deliberations the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing the item , the secretariat observed that guidance was sought from the Committee on the process for the design , development , operation and scope of the clearing-house mechanism , as well as on the possible operation of that mechanism on a pilot basis . Some representatives noted the need to explore synergies with other information exchange systems such as those of the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety , UNEP Chemicals and other organizations as well as with information exchange activities that were being discussed in the context of the capacity assistance network . Further to a request for clarification , the secretariat informed the Committee that while US $ 250,000 was estimated per annum for 2003 and 2004 to maintain the current web site and clearing house , as well as begin design of a future clearing house , US $ 1-1 . 3 million would be required per annum to establish a clearing house at the same level as some other multilateral environmental agreements . Some representatives questioned the appropriateness of assigning such a budget to the development of a clearing-house mechanism when resources were limited . The Committee noted the valuable and excellent information contained in the UNEP POPs web site and wished to see the current commitment to that web site maintained . The Committee considered that it was premature to embark on a pilot project on a clearing-house mechanism and that prior to initiating a process for the design , development , operation and scope of a clearing-house mechanism , a more detailed work programme should be prepared by the secretariat based on comments to be received from Governments . Decision INC-6 / 7 on a clearing-house mechanism for information exchange on persistent organic pollutants is contained in annex I to the present report . The Committee agreed to further consider this item at its next session . Technical assistance ( Article 12 ) In its deliberations the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing this item , the secretariat observed that the Committee might wish to consider three central issues : whether to establish a process for developing the guidance called for in paragraph 3 of article 12 for consideration by the Conference of the Parties at its first meeting , as well as the timing and modalities for that work ; whether to request the secretariat to undertake a feasibility study on ways and means of establishing and ensuring the functioning of regional and subregional centres called for in paragraph 4 of article 12 for capacity-building and transfer of technology within the framework of the Stockholm Convention ; or whether to request the secretariat to develop and conduct , in cooperation with the secretariat of the Basel Convention and the Basel Convention regional centres , a pilot initiative of regional and subregional centres for the purpose of facilitating technical assistance , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources . Representatives noted the important role that technical assistance , including technical assistance for capacity-building , would play in assisting developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition to fulfil their obligations under the Stockholm Convention . A rapid start to the provision of effective assistance was thus desirable . To focus efforts on the most important areas , it was necessary to evaluate the specific needs of different regions , subregions and countries regarding capacity-building and the transfer of technology . That information could be provided through written submissions from countries and other stakeholders ; experience gained in the development of national implementation plans under article 7 ; broader relevant experience gained developing and implementing action plans under other multilateral environmental agreements ; and proposals and other information gathered during the negotiation process that led to the Stockholm Convention , particularly article 12 on technical assistance . To enhance the provision of technical assistance in accordance with article 12 , representatives noted the value of seeking and utilizing efficiencies and synergies between the institutional arrangements provided for under the Stockholm Convention and other multilateral environmental institutions . Particular attention was placed on possible utilization of the regional and subregional centres created under the Basel Convention . At the same time , it was recognized that other potential arrangements existed , including : utilizing regional and subregional centres associated with other multilateral environmental institutions ; using some but not necessarily all of the Basel Convention centres , based on their comparative effectiveness and location , among other factors ; and creating new centres to address geographic or substantive gaps among existing regional and subregional centres . In examining potential arrangements , many factors needed to be taken into account , including : the comparative operational and economic efficiencies and synergies ; the consequences of co-locating centres for conventions with different memberships , mandates and implementation requirements and for which different government agencies are often responsible ; the experience of other multilateral environmental institutions with regard to the effective utilization of regional and subregional centres ; various mandates to increase synergies amongst multilateral environmental agreements and institutions ; relevant differences across regions and subregions with regard to implementing the Stockholm Convention ; the necessity and uncertainty of securing agreement with the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention and / or other multilateral environmental agreements ; and the various budgetary impacts . The Committee noted the potential value that a pilot initiative could have for determining the value of utilizing Basel Convention regional and subregional centres for facilitating the provision of technical assistance in accordance with article 12 of the Stockholm Convention . At the same time , important issues and concerns regarding the scope of the pilot initiative , the proper sequencing of the various studies , and the availability of extrabudgetary resources were recognized . In its deliberations on the capacity assistance network , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) . Introducing the item , the secretariat invited the Committee to consider the appropriateness of requesting the secretariat to begin preparatory work on the potential establishment of a capacity assistance network , as well as the possible timing and modalities for that work . Representatives noted the valuable role that some type of capacity assistance network could play to better facilitate and coordinate the provision of technical assistance to developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition . Such a network might also serve to link , with respect to the provision of technical assistance , various entities created under the Convention , such as the national focal points , regional and subregional centres and secretariat . Many uncertainties remained , however , including : the relevant options for the precise goals , design , operation , management , timing and funding of such a network ; the ability of any proposed network to take full account of the specific needs and special situation of least developed countries and small island developing States with regard to technical assistance , as required in paragraph 5 of article 12 ; the overall relationship between a capacity assistance network and the provision of technical assistance under article 12 or the clearing-house mechanism established under article 9 ; its relationship with other institutional entities involved in the provision of financial and technical assistance or the exchange of information , such as GEF and IFCS - INFOCAP ; its relationship with the broad issue of technology transfer ; the proper role for regional and subregional centres ; and the involvement of the private and non-governmental sectors . The Committee then decided to establish an open-ended contact group co-chaired by Mr. Jozef Buys ( Belgium ) and Mr. Christopher Corbin ( Saint Lucia ) with a mandate to address the draft decisions relating to technical assistance prepared by the secretariat . The outcome of the deliberations as adopted by the Committee are decisions INC-6 / 8 , INC-6 / 9 , INC-6 / 10 and INC-6 / 11 contained in annex I to the present reportnote H. Financial resources and mechanisms ( Article 13 ) Interim financial mechanism ( Article 14 ) The Committee took up its consideration of the above items concurrently . Introducing these items , the secretariat drew the Committee's attention to the documentation prepared on the subject ( see annex IX )) Representatives of the GEF secretariat then provided an overview of the structure and operation of GEF as well as details of the action taken by GEF since May 2001 in response to the resolutions of the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Stockholm Convention and the steps taken to facilitate early implementation of the Convention , particularly in relation to building capacity in eligible countries . Of particular note wereere the decision by the GEF Council in May 2002 to recommend to the GEF Assembly the creation of a new focal area for POPs and the progress made in facilitating simpler and more expeditious access to funding , including new approval procedures for project proposals under US $ 500,000 . To date , 64 countries representing all regions and levels of preparedness had already submitted proposals for national implementation plans funding to GEF and 45 proposals had already been approved under the expedited procedures . In addition , 12 countries were receiving GEF funding for their national implementation plans as part of the project - Development of National Implementation Plans for the Management of persistent organin organic pollutants - which was approved by the Council in May 2001 and which was being executed by UNEP Chemicals . In their presentations and in response to questions , the representatives of GEF outlined the formal relationships GEF had developed with the governing bodies of other conventions . They also outlined the proposed amendments to the GEF Charter that would reflect a new focal area for POPs as well as the status of GEF as the principal entity , on an interim basis , entrusted with the operation of the financial mechanism for the Stockholm Convention . Noting that GEF activity in the area of POPs was in its initial phase , they emphasized that GEF would respond to guidance from the Committee and , eventually , the Conference of the Parties , while continuously evolving its activities to suit the needs of the Stockholm Convention as far as possible . The Committee welcomed the efforts made by GEF to facilitate early implementation of the Convention , particularly the decision to recommend the creation of a new focal area for POPs , the proposed amendments to the GEF Charter , and the progress made in facilitating the application , approval and funding of projects to develop national implementation plans . The Committee noted the desirability of a memorandum of understanding between the Conference of the Parties and GEF to define the relationship between , and the respective responsibilities of , the two entities . To facilitate the development of the memorandum of understanding , the Committee noted that it would be advantageous to incorporate useful elements of similar agreements between GEF and other conventions , views of Governments regarding elements to be included , as well as the results of consultations between the secretariat and GEF , the secretariats of other conventions , and other bodies and experts regarding the experience gained in other conventions . Decision INC-6 / 12 on a draft memorandum of understanding with the Global Environment Facility , is contained in annex I to the present report . During the adoption of this decision , the Committee noted that the secretariat would compile any comments received from Governments , prior to its seventh session regarding the draft memorandum of understanding and make these available to the Committee at that session as an information document . The Committee acknowledged the need for the first Conference of the Parties to provide guidance to the financial mechanism , as required under paragraph 7 of article 13 . It was recognized that such guidance would be most useful if it were geared toward substantive issues related to specific implementation requirements under the Convention , and that it would be open to revision or expansion by subsequent meetings of the Parties . To facilitate their further deliberation , the Committee requested the secretariat to solicit views from Governments regarding elements they believed should be included in such guidance and to develop a document for consideration at the next meeting of the Committee . Such a document should also include elements drawn from consultations , as appropriate , between the secretariat and GEF , the secretariats of other conventions , and other bodies and experts regarding the experience gained in other conventions . The Committee acknowledged the potential value of developing for consideration by the Conference of the Parties draft terms of reference for use in the review of the financial mechanism called for under paragraph 8 of article 13 . It was noted that subparagraphs ( a ) through ( e ) of paragraph 7 of article 13 established much of the basis of such a review , although a number of other potential elements and processes were also discussed . With regard to the need to initiate preparations for a possible decision to be taken by the Conference of the Parties on the financial mechanism under article 14 , the Committee concluded that it was premature for it to discuss the issue at that time or for the secretariat to prepare any documentation for its next meeting . The secretariat then drew the Committee's attention to a document on the possible collection of information from relevant funding institutions on the ways in which they could support the Stockholm Convention ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 13 ) . The secretariat referred to resolutions of the Conference of Plenipotentiaries and , in particular , paragraph 5 of its resolution 2 , as the background to the paper . In this regard the Committee was invited to consider whether it wished to provide advice to the secretariat on the timing and the types of information to be collected , the process of doing so , and the type of funding institutions to contact . The Committee noted that gathering and synthesizing such information would be most useful but should be done in a judicious manner . It was also important not to limit the survey to intergovernmental organizations . Rather , the secretariat should gather information , as appropriate , from the full array of international , regional , national , private sector , non-governmental and private foundation-based funding institutions . On the basis of its deliberations , the Committee adopted decisions INC-6 / 13 , INC-6 / 14 and INC-6 / 15 , contained in annex I to the present report . J. Reporting ( Article 15 ) In its deliberations , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing the item , the secretariat said that the Committee might wish to consider the initiation stage or developing a process for format and timing of Party reporting obligations . The Committee noted that in preparing a reporting format effort should be placed on ensuring compatibility with provisions for reporting in other multilateral environmental agreements . The secretariat was encouraged to steer that format towards simplicity to facilitate efficient and effective reporting and to avoid making reporting an onerous burden to countries . In addition , a delineation should be made between reporting requirements that were mandatory and those that were not . The Committee requested the secretariat to prepare a paper on a possible format and timing for Party reporting obligations taking into account comments received from Governments as well as reporting obligations under other multilateral environmental agreements . The Committee also requested the secretariat to prepare a draft model format on reporting for consideration at its next session . Decision INC-6 / 16 , on format and timing of Party reporting is contained in annex I to the present report . Effectiveness evaluation ( Article 16 ) Introducing the item , the secretariat drew the Committee's attention to the documentation prepared on the subject ( see annex IX )) as well as a written proposal submitted to the Committee during the meeting . The Committee welcomed the continuing efforts of UNEP Chemicals in two major assessment and monitoring related activities , the Regionally Based Assessment of Persistent Toxic Substances project , funded by GEF and the Global Network on the Monitoring of Persistent Organic Pollutants in the Environment . The Committee noted the importance of activities that provided high quality , comparable , long-term , national , regional and global monitoring data on the substances controlled under the Convention . To be most useful for the purposes of evaluating the effectiveness of the Convention , the acquisition and evaluation of monitoring data would need to follow particular sequencing and procedures . It was recognized that capacity to obtain , compare and utilize such data varied across countries and regions . There were also opportunity , cost and budgetary implications of the different approaches to this issue . Following its initial deliberations , the Committee established a drafting group to draft text for a possible draft decision on this item . Decision INC-6 / 17 on effectiveness evaluation is contained in annex I to the present report . L. Non-compliance ( Article 17 ) In its deliberations the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing the item , the secretariat invited the Committee to consider initiating the process of developing a procedure and institutional mechanism for determining non-compliance with the Stockholm Convention as well as elements to be included in that regime . All representatives were of the view that the documentation prepared by the secretariat was a useful basis on which to initiate work . It was noted that article 17 of the Stockholm Convention provided that the Conference of the Parties would develop and approve procedures and institutional mechanisms for determining non-compliance "" as soon as practicable "" . Some representatives stated that the Committee should focus efforts during the interim period on activities that would facilitate the implementation of the Convention and its speedy entry into force . As such it was considered premature to precipitate the process for developing and approving non-compliance procedures and institutional mechanisms that would most likely not be presented to the Conference of the Parties at its first meeting . Other representatives stated that a compliance mechanism should be established at the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties or shortly thereafter . They also noted that the resolution on interim arrangements adopted at the Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Stockholm to facilitate the rapid entry into force and effective implementation of the Convention provided for work on non-compliance by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee . It was stressed that an effective mechanism to examine non-compliance was essential and that when developing that regime emphasis should be placed on a non-confrontational , facilitative and flexible regime that would encourage and assist countries to achieve and maintain compliance rather than be punitive . Some representatives also emphasized the importance of appropriate measures for addressing non-compliance . It was also noted that reporting on non-compliance should not place an undue burden on Parties and that provisions for technical assistance , technology transfer , financial resources and capacity-building should be taken into account while ensuring the territorial integrity and sovereignty of countries . Some representatives also emphasized the importance of appropriate measures for addressing non-compliance . Some representatives requested the secretariat to prepare , based on written comments from Governments , a draft model for a compliance mechanism for consideration by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee at its seventh session , while others proposed that the secretariat , based on those comments prepare a synthesis . Other representatives wanted the secretariat to only compile the written comments received from Governments . As an initial step , Governments would submit comments and proposals in writing , and preferably in electronic format , to the secretariat based on the provisions of article 17 of the Convention , on the elements provided in the draft text submitted by the secretariat in document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 17 , or regarding any other relevant aspects or national concerns . Those comments were to reach the secretariat no later than 31 December 2002 . The Committee requested the secretariat to prepare a full compilation of comments and proposals received from Governments for submission to the Committee at its seventh session . The secretariat would also provide a synthesis by issue of the comments and proposals to accompany that document . The Committee further requested the secretariat to prepare an analysis of non-compliance procedures included in other multilateral environmental agreements , taking into account pre-existing work on the subject , and to submit that analysis to the Committee at its seventh session . Decision INC-6 / 18 on non-compliance is contained in annex I to the present report . Settlement of disputes ( Article 18 ) In its deliberations , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing the item , the secretariat drew attention to the draft rules on arbitration and conciliation prepared by the secretariat . One representative , referring to articles 10 and 16 of the draft arbitration rules , noted that a precedent existed under the International Court of Justice to the effect that a decision of the court had not been binding on a third party intervening in a dispute . It was thus necessary to consider further whether the language of article 16 was appropriate to the Stockholm Convention . Another representative , referring to article 13 of the arbitration draft rules , considered that provision should be included for proper adequate notification of parties that did not appear before the tribunal , as well as guidance or warning concerning the consequences of continued non-appearance . The Committee agreed to forward the draft rules on arbitration and conciliation , as contained in the annex to the note by the secretariat on settlement of disputes ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 18 ) , to the legal drafting group for consideration , taking into account the comments made in the plenary . Reporting back to plenary on the draft rules on conciliation , the Chair of the legal drafting group noted in particular one policy issue that had been flagged for consideration at the seventh session of the Committee which was that for budgetary reasons , the group had examined the possibility of reducing the number of members of the Conciliation Commission of the Stockholm Convention from five members , as is standard in most other conciliation commissions , to three members . The Chair of the legal drafting group further reported that the group had not had sufficient time to consider the draft rules on arbitration at the current session but that it would return to that item at the seventh session of the Committee . The draft rules on arbitration and conciliation as reviewed by the legal drafting group are contained in annex II to the present report . Conference of the Parties ( Article 19 ) In its deliberations , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) ( i ) Draft rules of procedure of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies Introducing the item , the secretariat drew attention to the draft rules of procedure for the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies , as prepared by the secretariat and contained in the annex to document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 14 . It was explained that , while the rules of procedure of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee had been taken into account in the preparation work , they did not constitute a precedent for the rules of the Conference of the Parties . A number of representatives expressed appreciation for the work of the secretariat , which was considered to be a good basis for discussion . Others pointed out that they would be bringing specific concerns and proposals directly to the attention of the legal drafting group . In the course of the debate in plenary , proposals and comments addressed the following specific rules : Rule 6 ( Participation of United Nations , specialized agencies and non-Parties ) Rule 7 ( Participation of other bodies or agencies ) Several representatives proposed an amendment to the above rules to the effect that Parties are informed on the participation of observers in the meeting 60 days in advance of the meeting . That would allow developing countries , countries with economies in transition and non-governmental and other organizations to have time for adequate planning and coordination for their effective participation . Several other representatives drew attention to a potential policy issue of having to provide such notice to non-governmental organizations . Some representatives and expressed a reservation to the proposed amendment . The Committee requested the legal drafting group , in its consideration of the draft rules of procedure , to take fully into account the issues raised in the discussion on rules 6 and 7 . Rule 46 ( Majority required ) A number of representatives highlighted the need for further consideration of the different kinds of procedures required for decisions under the Stockholm Convention , and the different options available for the question , particularly considering the types of solutions applied under other multilateral agreements . One representative expressed a reservation at the concept of a two-thirds majority . Another representative stressed the need for the procedure chosen to be obstacle-free and to facilitate decision-making . One other representative offered to make available a conference room paper containing an analysis of the types of decisions to be adopted by the Conference of the Parties . Attention was also drawn to the link between rule 46 and rule 60 ( Amendments to the rules of procedure ) . Another representative considered that the provision in paragraph 4 , by which a proposal would be rejected after a second inconclusive vote , needed to be amended to provide for more time and , perhaps , an alternative method . It was observed that it might be necessary to see whether any precedent for such a method existed . The Committee requested the legal drafting group , in its consideration of the draft rules of procedure , to take fully into account the issues raised in the discussion on rule 46 . Rule 47 ( Order of voting on proposals ) One representative proposed deletion of the sentence "" The Conference of the Parties may , after each vote on a proposal , decide whether to vote on the next proposal "" . The Committee requested the legal drafting group , in its consideration of the draft rules of procedure , to take fully into account the issues raised in the discussion on rule 47 . The chair of the legal drafting group reported that the group had examined the draft rules of procedure of the Conference of the Parties . The chair indicated that there were several items relevant to rules 6 ( Participation of United Nations , specialized agencies and non-Parties ) , 7 ( Participation of other bodies or agencies ) , 22 ( Election of officers ) , 31 ( Voting in subsidiary bodies ) , 46 ( Majority required ) , and 47 ( Order of voting on proposals ) and 60 ( Amendments to the rules of procedure ) that would require policy decisions by the Committee . Those items were identified either by footnotes or by square brackets in the draft text of the legal drafting group that is contained in annex III to the present report . With regard to paragraph 4 of rule 46 , the last line sentence of rule 47 and a question raised on rule 60 , the chair of the legal drafting group confirmed that those were standard rules that could be found in other multilateral environmental agreements . The draft rules of procedure of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies as reviewed by the legal drafting group are contained in annex III to the present report . ( ii ) Draft financial rules for the Conference of the Parties , its subsidiary bodies and the Convention secretariat Introducing the item , the secretariat drew attention to the draft financial rules for the Conference of the Parties , its subsidiary bodies and the Convention secretariat , as prepared by the secretariat and contained in the appendix to document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 15 . It was noted that several paragraphs of the draft rules contained bracketed text , and that in some cases those would require further consideration . It was suggested that , following comments and proposals from the floor , the draft financial rules would be forwarded to the legal drafting group for examination , which would report to plenary on the results of its deliberations , bringing to its attention any areas where policy , rather than technical , matters required a decision . Several representatives expressed a reservation with regard to the reference in paragraph 12 ( a ) of the draft rules to the application of the indicative scale of assessments of the United Nations as a basis for the calculation of contributions to the Stockholm Convention . One representative pointed out that , in the General Assembly resolutions pertaining to the scale of assessments , it was noted that the scale of assessments and its adjustments did not automatically apply to specialized agencies and other intergovernmental organizations , and he called upon the secretariat to verify the General Assembly resolutions on application of the scale of assessments to members . One representative supported the current text in paragraph 12 ( a ) and requested the removal of the square brackets around the figures 0.001 , 22 and 0.01 . Attention was also drawn to the need to clarify how the member States' contributions to the Stockholm Convention were to be calculated . Several representatives pointed to the need to assess the options and methods used by other conventions and multilateral agreements for calculating the distribution of contributions , and one of them asked the secretariat to prepare for the seventh session of the Committee a reference document compiling information on the subject . The secretariat agreed to collect additional information and make it available to the Committee . One representative drew attention to the link between paragraph 1 of rule 46 of the draft rules of procedure , concerning decision-making by the Conference of the parties , and paragraph 4 of the draft financial rules . The Committee requested the legal drafting group , in its consideration of the draft financial rules for the Conference of the Parties , its subsidiary bodies and the Convention secretariat , to take fully into account the issues raised in the discussion in plenary . The chair of the legal drafting group reported that the group had had a first reading of the draft financial rules for the Conference of the Parties , its subsidiary bodies and the Convention secretariat . Some issues had been noted for review at the seventh session of the Committee and these had been highlighted in square brackets . The chair of the legal drafting group wished to have the assistance of a financial officer in that group during its deliberations second reading of the rules in order to refer them to the Committee for consideration on the item at the its seventh session of the Committee The draft financial rules for the Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants , its subsidiary bodies and the Convention secretariat as reviewed by the legal drafting group are contained in annex IV to the present report . Issues relating to the Stockholm Convention not covered above No issues were raised under this agenda item . P. Other issues for consideration by the Conference of the Parties at its first meeting ( i ) Location of the secretariat ( Resolution 6 of the Conference of Plenipotentiaries ) In its deliberations , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing the item , the secretariat invited the Committee to consider document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 21 on the location of the secretariat , which in its appendix set out the categories of information to be provided by potential host countries in support of their tenders , in order to ensure some comparability of the offers made . The Committee was invited to also consider the question of a deadline for the submission of such information , in order to allow for its adequate compilation by the secretariat in time for consideration by the Committee at its seventh session . The representatives of Germany , Italy and Switzerland reaffirmed the offers made by their Governments to host the secretariat . The Committee discussed and amended the information contained in the appendix to UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 21 and requested that candidate countries base their proposals to offer to host the secretariat on the information contained therein . The Committee agreed to invite interested countries to submit , by 30 November 2002 , the information called for in the appendix as amended by the Committee and contained in the appendix to decision INC-6 / 19 referred to below , for consideration by the Committee at its next session . Further to its deliberation , the Committee adopted decision INC-6 / 19 on consideration of offers to host the permanent secretariat of the Stockholm Convention , contained in annex I to the present report . ( ii ) Liability and redress ( Resolution 6 of the Conference of Plenipotentiaries ) In its deliberations , the Committee had before it the documentation on the subject prepared by the secretariat ( see annex IX )) Introducing the item , the secretariat invited the Committee to take note of the information submitted by countries and others on the subject of liability and redress , in response to the invitation by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries , which was compiled in an information paper prepared by the secretariat ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 5 ) . Attention was drawn to a workshop on liability and redress in the context of the Convention , to be hosted by the Government of Austria in Vienna from 19 to 21 September 2002 . The report of the workshop would be considered by the Conference of the Parties at its first meeting with a view to deciding what further action should be taken . Several representatives said that further comments on the subject of liability and redress should be solicited from those that had not yet provided information . Several representatives expressed gratitude and appreciation to the Government of Austria for hosting the upcoming workshop on liability and redress , which was considered to be very useful in helping the Conference of the Parties to take a decision on that question . Some disappointment was voiced that there had not been an opportunity at the current meeting for an exchange of views on liability and redress , since it was considered that such a discussion could have provided guidance for the agenda of the workshop . One representative , recalling that experience in other multilateral agreements had shown that liability and redress regimes involved lengthy and detailed negotiations , considered that , without greater justification , such a regime should not be developed for the Stockholm Convention . He thus proposed that the Vienna workshop should focus on examining such justification , rather than on the details of a liability and redress mechanism . The Committee called upon those that had not already done so to provide their comments on liability and redress to the secretariat by 31 July 2002 . The Committee also noted with gratitude Austria 's hosting of the workshop on liability and redress in Vienna in September 2002 . The Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries expressed their interest to host the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Stockholm Convention at the opening of the sixth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee . A presentation was made by the representatives of Uruguay and Switzerland on preparations under way towards the possible holding of the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Uruguay . The Committee welcomed the news of those discussions . The secretariat drew attention to the list of those that had signed and / or ratified , acceded to , accepted or approved the Stockholm Convention as at 11 June 2002 , as contained in document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / INF / 12 , pointing out that there had been no additions to that list to date . The secretariat referred also to the invitation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to Governments , requesting those intending to sign or ratify multilateral agreements to endeavour to do so on the occasion of the World Summit on Sustainable Development , to be held in Johannesburg from 26 August to 4 September 2002 . In order to assist countries to ratify or accede to the Convention , the Committee recommended that the secretariat , in consultation with the United Nations Treaty Section , prepare a checklist that would identify the general steps that a sovereign nation should complete before it deposits its instruments of ratification or accession to the United Nations . The representative of the United States informed the meeting that his Government would contribute $ 100 , 000 to support the convening of the first meeting of the expert group on BAT and BEP . The Committee agreed to review the process for reporting on its work early on in the agenda of the seventh session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee . The Committee adopted its report on the basis of the draft report contained in documents UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / L. 1 and L. 1 / Add . 1 which had been circulated during the meeting , as amended , and on the understanding that finalization of the report would be entrusted to the Rapporteur , working in conjunction with the secretariat . Following the customary exchange of courtesies , the Chair declared the session closed at 7.25 p. m . on Friday , 21 June 2002 . Annex I ITS SIXTH SESSION , HELD IN GENEVA FROM 17 TO 21 JUNE 2002 Decision INC-6 / 1 : Amendment of rule 8 of the rules of procedure for the meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee Decides by consensus , in accordance with rule 56 of the rules of procedure for its meetings , to amend rule 8 of the rules of procedure in order to increase the membership of the Bureau of the Committee to ten members ; Decides that the amended rule 8 shall read as follows : "" 1 . The Committee shall elect from among the representatives of the State Parties a Bureau composed of one Chair and nine Vice-Chairs , one of whom shall act as Rapporteur .

If all operative parts of a proposal or amendment have been rejected , the proposal or amendment shall be considered to have been rejected as a whole . Amendment to a proposal Rule 49 A motion is considered to be an amendment to a proposal if it merely adds to , deletes from , or revises parts of that proposal . An amendment shall be voted on before the proposal to which it relates is put to the vote , and if the amendment is adopted , the amended proposal shall then be voted on . Order of voting on amendments to a proposal Rule 50 If two or more amendments to a proposal are moved , the Conference of the Parties shall first vote on the amendment furthest removed in substance from the original proposal , then on the next amendment furthest removed therefrom , and so on , until all amendments have been put to the vote . The President shall determine the order of voting on the amendments under this rule . Method of voting for general matters Rule 51 Voting , except for elections , shall normally be by show of hands . A roll call vote shall be taken if so requested by any Party .

If in the second ballot the votes are equally divided , the President shall decide between the candidates by drawing lots . In the case of a tie in the first ballot among three or more candidates obtaining the largest number of votes , a second ballot shall be held . If a tie results among more than two candidates , the number shall be reduced to two by lot and the balloting , restricted to them , shall continue in accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraph 1 . Election to two or more elective places Rule 55 When two or more elective places are to be filled at one time under the same conditions , those candidates , not exceeding the number of such places , obtaining in the first ballot the largest number of votes and a majority of the votes cast by the Parties present and voting shall be deemed elected . If the number of candidates obtaining such majority is less than the number of persons or delegations to be elected , there shall be additional ballots to fill the remaining places , the voting being restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest number of votes in the previous ballot , to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled , provided that , after the third inconclusive ballot , votes may be cast for any eligible person or delegation .

Annex V REPORT OF CONTACT GROUP ON ARTICLE 19 , PARAGRAPH 6 : ESTABLISHMENT OF A SUBSIDIARY BODY TO REVIEW CANDIDATE POPS Co-chairs : Ms. Fatoumata Jallow Ndoye ( The Gambia ) Mr. Reiner Arndt ( Federal Republic of Germany ) Participants : More than 40 participants from all United Nations regions including intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations The following issues were discussed : A Task of the Committee The Conference of the Parties shall at its first meeting , establish a subsidiary body to be called the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee ( POPRC ) for the purposes of performing the functions assigned to that Committee by this Convention . The tasks of the Committee are outlined in article 8 . In brief , the Committee will examine information submitted by a Party in support of a proposal for listing of a chemical in annexes A , B or C. The outcome of the screening evaluation will be communicated to all Parties and observers for comments and input of additional information . A draft risk profile will then be prepared and addressed by the Committee , which will also request further information on socio-economic factors from Parties and observers . The Committee will subsequently discuss options for measures and prepare a draft report for the Conference of the Parties including recommendations for listing . In conclusion the process can be described as a scientific evaluation followed by a risk management evaluation . B Selection of Committee members and invited experts Expertise The expertise will be provided as laid out in article 19 , paragraph 6 ( a ) , by experts in chemicals assessment or management . It was agreed that procedures for designation should be sufficiently flexible to allow participation of government-designated experts with different types of expertise . To ascertain the qualifications of the experts , relevant curriculum vitae should be provided by Governments and be accessible to the Conference of the Parties . Some members considered that it was clear from the annexes that this involves among other disciplines experts from health and environment areas and that it is important that the different types of expertise needed for the Committee are balanced . It was agreed , however , that guidance given to Governments should not be too prescriptive . Length of term It was agreed that four years would be a reasonable minimum term . It was considered necessary to develop a flexible system that would ensure continuity as well as sufficient turnover , bearing in mind equitable geographical distribution , and a strategy of overlapping terms was suggested . Conflict of interest The PIC model ( Decision INC-8 / 1 ) was acknowledged as a good starting point on how to resolve the conflict of interest issue for Pollutant Organic Pollutants Review Committee members . Invited experts to the Committee and the role of such experts It was agreed that the Committee would need to invite external experts to support it in its work . Criteria would need to be set for the selection of such experts . A pool or roster of external experts might be established by inviting Governments to designate experts , e . g . for areas of expertise or specific substance knowledge . The Committee would normally invite experts from this pool / roster . Consideration should be given to developing processes by which such a pool could be created . Costs of travel and other costs related to participation would be expected to be covered for invited experts from developing countries and countries with economies in transition according to normal United Nations practice . In addition , if specific expertise is not available for a certain issue from this pool , POPRC could identify other non-government-designated experts as necessary . The way of funding their participation needs to be addressed . Committee members might bring additional experts to the meeting , as appropriate . Conflict of interest issues for experts invited by POPRC would be evaluated and decided by POPRC , while those of the POPRC members would be evaluated and decided by the Conference of the Parties . Some experts could come from industry and other non-governmental organizations . In such a case , it would be important for POPRC to identify through conflict of interest procedures where the potential conflict of interest lies in order to decide on their participation . Composition and size of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee Composition and regional balance It was agreed that the number of POPRC members should be approximately 30 to 40 . It was suggested by several countries that the Convention should follow the five United Nations regions in achieving equitable geographical distribution and that seven members per region might be a starting point for discussion . Other members could not agree on this point . It was agreed that the question of what is meant by "" equitable geographical distribution "" should be put to the UNEP legal counsel / legal drafting group . Some members suggested that concepts used in other instruments , e . g . , the Montreal Protocol should also be studied . Nominations At the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties , the Parties will establish the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee pursuant to article 19 , paragraph 6 . This means that Governments need to be prepared to designate experts for POPRC at the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties . This implies the need for a timely start of preparations on a process that would encompass and address this issue . Replacements This would have to be looked at in the context of how experts are designated by Governments for POPRC . Frequency of meetings Due to the technical nature of work to be accomplished it was agreed that POPRC should normally meet once a year , subject to availability of funds and work requirements . The meetings should take place between meetings of the Conference of the Parties and be scheduled so that proposals for listing chemicals could go forward to the following Conference of the Parties . D Operational guidelines Ad hoc and intersessional groups It was agreed to have operational procedures that facilitate establishment of ad hoc working groups , such as chemical specific groups during meetings , and also to work intersessionally to support the expeditious work of the Committee . These groups should be chaired by at least one of the Committee members but they could consist of POPRC members as well as experts selected by the Committee . Formal subcommittees should be avoided . Transparency of procedures The Convention provides for transparency at all stages of the process for adding candidate POPs as described in article 8 . It was agreed that the reports from POPRC should be publicly available and easily accessible . Any recommendation from the Committee should provide the reasons for the decision , as well as dissenting views . The decisions and meeting reports would be available as the Conference of the Parties meeting documents in all six United Nations languages . Observers The Committee should be open to observers and Parties that are not members of the Committee . The role of observers will be addressed in the rules of procedure for the Conference of the Parties and is also described under article 8 . It was noted that one of the major roles of observers was to increase transparency and provide additional information . It was agreed that the Party which submits a proposal for listing a chemical should be invited as an observer to POPRC meetings . Work plan with time frames It was agreed that the Committee should work in an efficient and timely manner and would also need to set priorities on substances in case of a large workload . For each chemical under consideration a work plan with time frames would be needed for its work . Such work plans would need to be flexible , determined by the workload and by the need to acquire information from all stakeholders and should be submitted to the Conference of the Parties . Preparations of meetings The Convention states that the Committee shall prepare the risk profiles and risk management evaluation for its meetings . In practice this usually means that members of the Committee would lead the preparation of these documents , drawing upon existing peer reviewed material in the first instance . The group encouraged nominating Party or Parties to speed up the process by submitting a proposal for listing of a chemical together with a draft risk profile and a draft risk management proposal . This could substantially facilitate the work of the Committee . Recommendations and reports to the Conference of the Parties The Committee could make recommendations to the Conference of the Parties on its functioning and operational procedures . Recommendations to list chemicals in annexes A , B or C are sent to the Conference of the Parties . Confidentiality of data It was agreed that if the Committee received confidential information it should ensure that article 9 , paragraph 5 was respected . It was agreed that confidentiality arrangements should be codified by POPRC as a matter of priority . E Rules Status of the Chair and Bureau It was suggested that due to the expected workload , besides the Chair , a co-Chair for POPRC might also be elected . Alternatively , vice-chairs may be used . The Conference of the Parties should be given enough flexibility to decide . This might be raised with the legal drafting group when it addresses the draft rules of procedure of the Conference of the Parties . Rules of procedure of the Conference of the Parties concerning subsidiary bodies It was agreed that some of the rules of procedure of the Conference of the Parties might not be applicable to POPRC . The working language for POPRC and its working groups as well as for the documentation for the meetings should be English only , but the outcome of the meetings should be available in all United Nations languages . Concerning rule 11 in the draft rules of procedure of the Conference of the Parties , it was suggested that six weeks would be insufficient for the distribution of some very technical and complicated documents to POPRC and that three months would be more appropriate . It was agreed , however , that this should be left to POPRC to decide as part of its operational guidelines . F Budget Support for members of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee from developing countries and countries with economies in transition It was agreed that financial support , i . e . , travel and daily subsistence allowance , to members of POPRC from developing countries and countries with economies in transition should be made available for participation in POPRC meetings . Budgeting and costs for various parts of the work The issue of total costs for the functioning of POPRC was raised . The cost of a workshop-like meeting with 40 participants ( about 30 being paid for ) for one week would amount to approximately $ 100 , 000-150 , 000 depending on the amount of preparation made outside the secretariat . Annex VI Budget for 2003 and indicative budget for 2004 ( in US $ ) Table 1 Additional information : Budget breakdown by work area Annex VII An Expert Group on best available techniques / best available practices ( BAT / BEP ) is hereby established by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants to develop guidelines on best available techniques and to develop provisional guidance on best environmental practices relevant to the provisions of article 5 of the Convention , for consideration by the Conference of the Parties upon entry into force of the Convention . The guidelines and guidance to be developed should be practical and general in nature but with reference to more detailed and specialized technical information to achieve a realistic and meaningful level of release reduction or source elimination . These should also help assist decision-making at the country level . To enhance the practicality of the guidelines and the guidance , the Expert Group should provide commentary on issues and approaches relevant to their implementation . For example , the guidelines and guidance to be developed should take into consideration : The problems and opportunities that might be encountered in implementing BAT and BEP ; The particular circumstances of developing countries and some countries with economies in transition ; Available mechanisms for information exchange of BAT and BEP measures . The work of the Expert Group is technical in nature . Therefore , to enhance the efficiency of the Group and taking into account budgetary constraints , the number of participants in the meetings of the Expert Group should be kept to a manageable number ( a maximum of 50-55 ) in the following proportions : The Expert Group's meetings shall be open to government-designated experts . Representation from developing countries ( 15 ) , from countries with economies in transition ( three ) and from developed countries ( 18 ) shall be ensured . Representation of all regions should be encouraged ; Intergovernmental ( two ) and non-governmental organizations ( four from environmental non-governmental organizations and four from industrial non-governmental organizations ) may participate as observers . A balanced representation of developing and developed countries is encouraged ; Additional experts shall be invited as needed for each meeting with the status of observer .

The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee shall identify two interim co-Chairs of the Expert Group for the purpose of facilitating the first meeting of the Expert Group . The Expert Group shall at its first meeting elect , from among government representatives , officers to serve as the two co-Chairs . The secretariat of the Stockholm Convention will provide the secretariat for the Expert Group . The Expert Group shall apply , mutatis mutandis , the rules of procedure of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee except as otherwise provided in these terms of reference . The secretariat , in consultation with the officers of the Expert Group , shall prepare a provisional agenda for each meeting of the Group . The provisional agenda shall be communicated to all participants of the Expert Group and all interested parties at least six weeks before the start of the meeting . English shall be the working language of the Expert Group . All documents adopted by the Expert Group shall be translated into Arabic , Chinese , French , Russian , and Spanish . The Expert Group shall consider and adopt a report at each meeting to inform the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee of the results of its discussion ; The reports shall be circulated to all participants of the Expert Group meetings and the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee at least six weeks in advance of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee ; The Expert Group shall present its report on guidelines and provisional guidance for consideration by the Conference of the Parties upon entry into force of the Convention . The Expert Group shall make every effort to reach agreement by consensus among participating Governments on the guidelines on BAT and provisional guidance on BEP that it presents to the Conference of the Parties for its consideration . Should consensus not be reached , all proposals by participating Governments shall be reflected in the report to be submitted to the Conference of the Parties . Annex VIII Statements by representatives of non-governmental organizations The representative of the International POPs Elimination Network ( IPEN ) highlighted activities by IPEN , including specific cases of participation by organizations in more than 40 countries to help reduce and eliminate POPs . He encouraged Governments to involve non-governmental organizations in enabling activities and the preparation and implementation of national implementation plans . The representative of the Worldwide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) reported on its work with a number of intergovernmental organizations to establish the Africa Stockpile Programme which seeks to clean up stockpiled pesticides and pesticide contaminated waste in Africa ; to catalyse development of prevention measures ; and to provide capacity-building and institutional strengthening on important chemicals-related issues . AAnnex IX The underlined subheadings are included in the draft rules for the convenience of work of the Committee and , consistent with rules of procedure of other multilateral environmental agreements , will not be included in the draft rules of procedure to be adopted by the Conference of the Parties . Consideration may be given to staggered terms of office , where the term of office of the President runs from the beginning of the Conference of the Parties to the beginning of the next Conference of the Parties , and the term of office of the Vice-Presidents runs from the closure of the Conference of the Parties to the closure of the next Conference of the Parties . This approach would accommodate the situations where offers to host the Conference of the Parties are made intersessionally or where the host country Party changes during the intersessional period . The Committee may also wish to consider whether to stagger the terms of office of the Vice-Presidents of the Conference of the Parties to enhance continuity and expertise . The following additional rule 26 bis was suggested for further consideration by the legal drafting group : "" Unless otherwise decided by the Conference of the Parties , the present rules shall apply , mutatis mutandis , to the proceedings of any working group or committee established by the Conference of the Parties or by a subsidiary body . "" Precedents for this rule may be found in rules of procedure of Conferences of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity , the Montreal Protocol and the Basel Convention . It was not included in the draft rules of procedure of the Conference of the Parties of the Rotterdam Convention . It is used to make it clear that for subsidiary bodies rule 22 ( 4 ) of the overall rules of procedure , which does not allow the President of the Conference of the Parties to vote at Conference of the Parties meetings , may not be appropriate to apply , mutatis mutandis , to the powers of Chairpersons of subsidiary bodies . The matter can also be dealt with in drafting the rules of procedure and terms of reference for individual subsidiary bodies . As precedent is divided , the Committee may wish to : a ) keep the rule here in the Conference of the Parties rules of procedure , or b ) follow the precedent of the Rotterdam Convention and remove the rule from the Conference of the Parties rules and deal with the issue of voting powers of Chairpersons of subsidiary bodies when drafting their terms of reference and rules of procedure , for example , in the current Persistent Organic Pollutant Review Committee process . There are various procedural rules for decision-making by the Conference of the Parties in the Convention where efforts to reach consensus have been exhausted and consensus could not be reached . These include variations providing for decisions by a three-fourths majority of the Parties present and voting ( see , e . g . , Convention article 20 ( 3 ) and article 21 ( 2 ) and ( 3 )) , and variations providing for decisions by consensus ( see , e . g . Convention articles 19 ( 4 ) and 22 ( 5 ) and ( 6 )) . With respect to the Conference of the Parties decisions on which the Convention is silent as to procedure , there are various voting options that could be considered ( e . g . , consensus then two-thirds or three-fourths majority , consensus , double majorities , etc. ) . It would also be possible to provide for a single rule of decision that would apply to all such decisions ( as in the current draft formulation of this paragraph ) or to provide and specify that different types of the Conference of the Parties decisions would be subject to different rules of decision ( e . g . , some specified decisions subject to a two-thirds majority vote , while others would be subject to consensus or to some other rule of decision ) . Although this provision is well precedented in other multilateral environmental agreements , a request was made to consider different precedents from other fora . Precedents for this rule exist in the rules of procedure of Conferences of the Parties of the following multilateral environmental agreements : the Convention on Biological Diversity , the Convention to Combat Desertification , the Rotterdam Convention ( draft rules ) and the Basel Convention . One delegation raised a question about the second sentence . The legal drafting group studied the issue and noted that this sentence appears in the rules of procedure for the following multilateral environmental agreements : the Convention on Biological Diversity , the Convention to Combat Desertification , the Rotterdam Convention ( draft rules ) and the Basel Convention . Cross reference with rule 7 shall be revisited by the legal drafting group and examined in order to prevent any potential conflict with the present rule . Different views were expressed in the Committee on whether to use the United Nations scale of assessment . The legal drafting group considered that the issue was a policy question for the Committee to decide . The percentage in the square brackets is the current minimum rate of contribution on the United Nations scale of contributions . If the percentage changes by the time of the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties , the figure will be adjusted accordingly . Precedents for this figure exist in the financial rules of other multilateral environmental agreements . The percentage in the square brackets is the current maximum rate of contribution on the United Nations scale of contributions . If the percentage changes by the time of the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties , the figure will be adjusted accordingly . The legal drafting group noted that , while the majority of the financial rules for multilateral environmental agreements use the word "" due "" , the financial rules of the Convention to Combat Desertification use the word "" expected "" . The legal drafting group requests the secretariat to consult with financial experts on this provision and report back to the legal drafting group . The legal drafting group requests the secretariat to inform it on the practical operation of the present rule . Precedents for this rule and the word "" related "" are found in the financial rules for the following multilateral environmental agreements : the Convention on Biological Diversity , the Montreal Protocol , the Framework Convention on Climate Change and other agreements . Average local cost of conducting an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee session is approximately US $ 150,000 . This includes equipment rental , paper , facility related expenses , hospitality , etc. Such as exemption register ( UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 4 ) , and formats for reporting required under the Convention including those listed in document UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 9 . Ref . UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 6 and UNEP / POPS / INC. 6 / 7 . This includes maintaining a current and up-to-date list of national focal points , exchange of information with these focal points , and responding to requests for assistance in technical and other matters . Ref . : Decisions INC-6 / 9 , INC-6 / 10 and INC-6 / 11 contained in annex I to the present report . This is a one-time charge . Alternatively , a staff member , including support costs , may be engaged for a two-year period . This also includes developing training and outreach materials , organization and conduct of as well as participation in workshops , and selected training for developing countries and countries with economies in transition . Ref . The Committee's decision was to maintain the status quo for 2003 . No decision was taken for 2004 . This mandate is referred to in paragraphs 4 and 7 of resolution 1 on interim arrangements adopted at the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Stockholm Convention and under article 5 and annex C of the Convention ."

443	"Paper 26 : The application of Clifford algebra to calculations of multicomponent chemical composition . Dr John P. Fletcher , Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry , School of Engineering and Applied Science , Aston University , Aston Triangle , Birmingham B4 7 ET , U. K. Email : J. P. F letcher @ aston . a c . u k Abstract In a mixture of chemical compounds , the significant variable is often the proportion of molecules , normally expressed as a mole fraction in a particular sample . The fractions are constrained to add to one , so any change such as the addition of some more of any chemical component causes all of the mole fractions change in a nonlinear way . Lasenby et al [ 1 ] have applied Clifford Algebra to the problem of projection and shown that problems can be made linear and results obtained . In this paper a similar approach is used to show that some nonlinear problems , such as conversion between molar and mass basis , become linear when projected into a space of increased dimension . When this is done using the V product defined by Miralles et al this [ 2 ] can be done using a Clifford algebra with all positive signature . Examples are given of the results of the formulation . 1 Introduction Calculation of multicomponent chemical composition is necessary in many calculations in chemical engineering and chemistry . It is complicated by the fact the some of the calculations are on the basis of the mass of each component present , and others on the basis of the relative number of molecules . Different molecules differ in relative mass , expressed as the relative molecular mass , or molecular weight . The proportions of a mixture are often expressed as a set of fractions which are constrained to add to one . Both the mass fractions and the mole fractions are nonlinear functions of the total number of molecules of each component present . Conversion between them is a nonlinear operation . These calculations are often necessary in phase equilibrium calculations , where it is desired to calculate the compositions of a vapour phase and a liquid phase , or two liquid phases , which are in equilibrium . In general the two phases will be of different chemical composition . The calculation is often made difficult by problems of modelling the nonlinear behaviour of the properties of the chemical components . Such calculations are a vital feature of chemical engineering design , There are advantages to be gained if the basis part of the calculation can be made linear . This paper shows that the calculations needed for phase equilibrium calculations have some similarity in form to the projection calculations discussed by Lasenby et al [ 1 ] . They have shown that some nonlinear problems are linear when projected to an extra dimension using a Clifford algebra . In this paper consideration is given to applying these methods to the formulation of the algebra of multicomponent chemical composition using the same techniques . One issue in these calculaltions is the appropriate choice of the Clifford algebra to use . In this , use has also been made of the methods of Mirrales et al [ 2 ] who define a V product which is effectively a means of using one basis on Clifford objects defined in a different basis . This opens up the possibility of carrying out the projection calculations of Lasenby et al [ 1 ] while using a Clifford basis with all positive signature . These ideas have been applied to the calculation of the transformation from the mass basis to the mole basis , with particular emphasis on the formulation of phase equilibrium calculations . 2 Projection Lasenby et al [ 1 ] describe the use of a projective space for representation of invariants in computer vision . They introduce a vector X in a Clifford algebra of signature ( 1 , 3 ) with basis vectors with the signatures Taking the product of X with the basis vector 4 gives an expression in terms of a three dimensional vector x where x is defined in terms of the bivectors of the original algebra . This author considered this representation as possible way to represent the multicompent chemical composition , and has adapted it for the modelling of multicomponent chemical composition . 3 The V product Mirralles et al [ 2 ] discuss the algebra of signature change among Clifford algebras of the same total dimension . The example which is discussed in their paper . For the case of the Clifford ( 4 ) algebra they take two objects of any grade A and B with Clifford product AB . They define a Vee or V product such that A B is equivalent to the multiplication of objects defined in Clifford ( 1 , 3 ) . For two vector objects u and v in Clifford ( 4 , 0 ) the definition is where e 0 is chosen from among the basis vectors of the algebra . For theis definition the symmetric part is given by in comparision with the Clifford product They show that the unsymmetric part is the same as for the Clifford product . The definition extends to the grades of the multigrade objects as follows . This author considered this as an alternative for the representation of the multicompent chemical composition , and has applied it for the modelling of multicomponent chemical composition . 4 Multicomponent chemical composition 4.1 Projection Model The analysis of the multicomponent chemical composition follows the algebra of Lasneby et al [ 1 ] , using the Clifford ( 3 , 1 ) algebra rather than the Clifford ( 1 , 3 ) . Suppose that a closed chemical system contains a mass M i of each of 3 chemical components . Define an object M in a Clifford ( 3 , 1 ) vector space with orthogonal basis vectors i as follows The system is defined such that This will be referred to as the full system . A reduced coordinate system can be constructed by taking the geometric product of an object in the system with 0 . This will be called the reduced system . If the bivectors in this relation are taken as defining a three dimensional Clifford ( 3 , 0 ) algebra Then an object m in this new space is given by where are the mass fractions for the system . An object D in the full system is defined as follows . Then the dot product of D with M gives which represents the mass balance and the relation that the x i sum to unity . The advantage of this procedure is that M is linear in the components whereas m is nonlinear , but can be easily constructed from it . Thus 4.2 Conversion between mass and molar basis . To scale to units proportional to the numbers of molecules , using the relative molecular mass r i of each component , then a new vector N in the full system can be constructed as follows , using the inverses of the relative molecular masses then if M 0 = M 1 + M 2 + M 3 This is a linear operation , which in matrix terms can be written , with M 0 = M 1 + M 2 + M 3 , as and defined as The molar fraction vector n can then be found from N using the same method as before . where with are the molar fractions in the system . This can be expressed in terms of N i , the components of N , as This conversion is quite general , and the reverse operation can be written as If the two matrices are combined , the result is a matrix which transforms an object such as M into itself . This is defined to be I. and clearly 4.3 Vapour-Liquid Equilibrium The usual chemical engineering formulation of vapour liquid equilibrium is for each of the components , where x i are the liquid molar fractions and y i are the vapour molar fractions . K i is called the equilibrium constant and is in general a function of temperature , pressure and all the molar fractions in both phases . Defining objects for the two phases as previously , where X i and Y i are on a mloar basis , and then converting the equilibrium expression to this basis results in the expression Summing over all the components which implies that the K i are not independent . It follows that and This means that the Y i are in the same proportions as the K i X i and the following calculation yields some linear multiple of Y. so that , using the previous notation , 4.4 Flash calculation One application of these equations is to a flash calculation where a fixed amount of material is available , which will be distributed between the two phases . If that material is designated by Z such that then The matrix form of this is This is invertible as where This provides a formulation of the flash calculation which can be used for an iterative solution given models for the dependence of K i on the variables . 4.5 Chemical Reaction If a chemical reaction occurs transforming a vector A in the full molar system to a vector B then where Q is the effect of the reaction . If on a molar basis Q 1 moles of component 1 become Q 2 moles of component 2 then so that 4.6 Volume and thermodynamic functions Functions whose value is proportional to the amount of material , termed extensive functions , can be expressed in terms of the contribution of each component . For example the volume V of a liquid can be expressed in terms of the molar numbers N i of a vector N and the partial molar volumes V i as This can be represented in the full system as and the value of the property can be extracted as This can be extended to intensive properties such as density where and expressing with the value of the property given by 5 Vee product model The development of this model is very similar to the previous model , using a different Clifford basis . Suppose that a closed chemical system contains a mass M i of each of the components . Define an object M in a Clifford ( 4 , 0 ) vector space with orthogonal basis vectors i as follows The system is defined such that with The bivectors in this relation are taken as defining a three dimensional Clifford ( 0 , 3 ) algebra Then an object m in this new space is given by where are the mass fractions for the system as before . If an object D in the full system is defined as follows . then the symmetric part of the V product of D with M choosing 0 as the special basis vector gives which is the mass balance equation as in the projection model . Thus the alternative of the Clifford ( 4 , 0 ) basis can be used and still have the same relationship among the components . One difference is that the reduced basis now has an all negative signature . That is not a problem because it is the sum of the mass fractions which is significant in calculation and not their vector norm . The only calculation which depends upon the signature of the algebra is the extraction of an extensive property which now becomes 6 Generalisation The examples have been constructed using three chemical components . The method can be generalised to more components by increasing the number of basis vectors . No calculation makes use of any property of the Clifford Algebra which changes as the dimension increases . 7 Conclusions The projection method can be used to formulate the equations of multicomponent chemical composition , including phase equilibrium and chemical reaction , and both extensive and intensive properties which can be calculated from contributions from each component . This can be done either using the approach of Lasenby et al [ 1 ] or that of Miralles et al [ 2 ] . 8 References [ 1 ] J. Lasenby , E. Bayro-Corrochano , A. N. Lasenby and G. Sommer .

899	"DES BUYS A NEW SHED "" I 've come to a major decision , "" announced Des one morning in the cafe . "" I ca n't put it off any longer . "" "" Oh thank goodness , "" said Mick . "" Yes , it 's been something of an embarrassment for ages , "" said Des . "" So the time has now come to splash out and buy a brand new one ! "" "" You 're joking ?! "" exclaimed Clive . "" Have you finally come to your senses ?! "" "" Yep , "" said Des . "" I 'm going to get a really nifty top-of-the-range model ! "" "" Fantastic ! "" said Clive . "" Maybe this will mean house prices will finally be on the rise round here ! "" "" Why are you always so bothered about house prices ? "" said Mick . "" Because when my house finally reaches a reasonable price I 'll be able to sell it and leave you bunch of muppets behind forever !! "" said Clive . Just then Mike the Manic Mechanic walked in . "" Hey Mike , great news , Des is finally going to buy a new car ! "" said Clive . "" Brilliant Des , about time too ! "" said Mike . "" Now I 've got some fantastic deals on at the moment , how do you fancy a brand new used 1983 Fiesta XR2 with a mere 4000 totally genuine honest guv miles on the clock and a sunroof ! "" Just then Mrs Greasy came out with their lunch . "" Oh my goodness , look at the time ! "" said Clive suddenly . "" I 'm due at the squash club !! "" He got up and dashed out of the cafÃ© . "" No , no , Mike , I 'm not buying a new car !! "" said Des . "" Clive misunderstood what I was talking about !! What would I want to buy a new car for , I could never sell my beloved Fiat 126 !! "" "" Darn , "" said Mike . "" I was talking about my snowdome ! "" said Des . "" Look at it , it does n't even work any more ! "" He took his snowdome out of his pocket , shook it , and nothing happened . "" Well it is summer , you do n't get snow in the summer , "" pointed out Mike . "" Oh yes , and I 'm getting a new shed as well , "" said Des . "" But first I must clear out the old one . "" After having to endure Mrs Greasy's lunch , Des went back to his house and down his garden to begin clearing out his shed . Mick came along as well since he evidently had nothing better to do . "" Good grief , you need a new shed more than you need a new snowdome ! "" said Mick . They looked at the shed â the walls were all leaning inwards , there was no glass in the window frames and there were numerous holes in the canvas roof . "" Okay , you open the door , "" said Des . "" Why me ? "" said Mick . "" Well ... I have n't been in there for about ten years , "" said Des . "" I 'm afraid that if I open the door the whole thing might just collapse ! "" "" Well I 'm not opening it !! "" said Mick . "" Do you think I 'm mad ?! "" "" Let 's find someone else to do it then , "" said Des . "" Like Clive ! "" "" But he 's gone down the squash club ! "" said Mick . "" No he 's not , he 's over there in his garden ! "" said Des . Clive was sitting on his garden , sipping an ice cold drink , as it was quite a warm day . Des and Mick walked across to the fence and peered over at him . "" What do you want ?! "" snapped Clive . "" Ca n't you see I 'm busy !! "" "" You 're supposed to be at the squash club ! "" said Mick . "" I am ! The orange squash club ! Membership of one ! And I 'd like it to stay that way !! "" "" We were just wondering if you could come and open my shed door , "" said Des . "" Are you mad , I 'm not going in that rickety old thing ! "" said Clive . "" And that 's final ! "" "" Um ... I 've got some rare vinyl Bee Gees albums in there ! "" said Des . Immediately Clive put his drink down , walked over the fence , straight across Des's garden and opened the shed door . He walked inside the shed and started searching for the Bee Gees records . "" Oh , "" said Des , slightly disappointed to see that the shed had not collapsed around Clive's ears . "" See Mick , perfectly safe ! "" "" Where are these records then ?! "" said Clive . "" Umm , well actually I have n't really ... "" said Des . "" Oh here they are ! "" said Clive , picking up a box in the corner . "" Cor , there 's some classic stuff here ! Thanks Des !! "" Clive walked out of the shed carrying the box of Bee Gees records while Des looked on in amazement . "" You 're not a secret Bee Gees fan are you ?! "" said Mick . "" No I 'm not , it 's so long since I 've been in that shed I 've no idea what 's in there ! "" said Des . "" Anyway , Clive has proved it 's perfectly safe to go in there , come on ! "" "" Hmmm , I think I 'll just hang around outside , it 's quite a nice day today ! "" said Mick . "" Suit yourself , "" said Des . He went inside the shed and started searching through piles of stuff . Before long the contents of the shed were piling up outside . Other than the usual garden equipment , they included a moose's head , an old gramophone , a model skeleton , a birdcage , a trilby , ten garden gnomes , an old cooker , a rocking horse , some flying ducks , and a massive poster of Bob Carolgees and Spit the Dog . As Mick looked on , he kept expecting the shed to come crashing down at any minute , but remarkably it still managed to stay up . After an hour or so , Des had finally finished clearing it out , and he and Mick looked round at all the junk that had taken over Des's garden . "" Did all that stuff really fit inside that small shed ?! "" said Mick . "" Certainly did ! "" said Des . The shed now looked even more precarious now everything had been cleared out . Mick peered inside and saw there was still one thing left inside - a rake that was leaning against the wall . "" Oi Des , that 's my rake , I always wondered what happened to that !! "" exclaimed Mick . "" Is it ? "" said Des . "" Oh no , I would n't ... "" Mick strode inside and claimed his rake . Immediately the wall collapsed inwards . Mick tried to dart out the way , but then the other walls began to fall inwards . Mick went through an empty window frame , and then right through the canvas roof as it crashed down . He was left standing there with his rake , covered in dust , in the middle of the remains of the shed . "" Oh Mick , that rake was the only thing holding the shed up ! "" said Des , who was stood well back . "" Was it really ?!?! "" exclaimed Mick . "" At least it saves taking it apart ! "" said Des . "" Oi you lot , keep the noise down , I 've trying to enjoy a peaceful sit in the garden !! "" shouted Clive . "" Hey Clive , you do n't want a moose's head , do you ? "" said Des . "" Oh , you 've got one already ! Ha !! "" Clive snarled . "" Seriously though , is there anything you do want ? "" said Des . "" Poster of Bob Carolgees ? I can see you 're tempted ! "" "" No ! "" said Clive . "" What about you , Mick ? "" said Des . "" I do n't want a poster of him either ! "" said Clive . "" That 's just a pile of ridiculous old junk ! "" said Mick , who was busy wiping the dust off himself . "" Why do n't you just get rid of it all !! "" "" Naaah ! "" said Des . "" Might be worth something one day ! "" Des cleared the bits of the shed out of the way . Next came the big purchase â a brand new shed ! But first of all Des had to go and quickly buy his new snowdome . Then he went to the garden centre , with Mick tagging along . "" What a vast selection of sheds on offer ! "" said Mick , looking at the vast selection of sheds on offer . They were located outside the garden centre itself , in an area adjacent to the car park . "" I 'll have that one , "" said Des , pointing at the first shed he saw . "" Are n't you going to have a look around ? "" said Mick . "" See what else is on offer ? Perhaps buy a copy of ' Which Shed ' ? That 's what I did ! "" "" You would , "" said Des . "" Look at them , they 're all the same ! I 'll have this one , looks good enough to me ! "" Des handed over the cash to the sales assistant , and the shed was now in Des's possession . "" Now the only problem is ... "" said Des . "" How am I going to get it home ? "" He tried lifting it , without much success , obviously . "" Could n't you just get the garden centre to deliver it ? "" said Mick . Just then Mike the Manic Mechanic came up to them , carrying a large garden gnome . "" Oh hi there Des and Mick , "" said Mike . They looked at his gnome . "" Oh no , it 's not for me , it 's for my Aunty Mavis's birthday . I do n't like her , so I thought she 'd hate this ! Is that your new shed ? "" Des stared hard at the shed for several seconds . "" You know what Mike , I think it is ! "" said Des . "" Thanks for pointing it out ! "" "" No problem , "" said Mike . "" Actually , I have got a bit of a problem , "" said Des . "" I know that , "" said Mike . "" How am I going to get this shed home ? "" said Des . "" Could you perhaps ... "" "" The answer is obvious !! "" exclaimed Mike . "" Bring round your car ! "" Des drove round his car from the car park . When he got out , Mike started taking off the wheels . "" Mike , what are you doing ?! "" exclaimed Des . "" Simple ! "" said Mike . "" I 'm going to transfer the wheels , engine , chassis and steering column from your car onto this shed . Then you can drive it home !! "" "" Riiiight , "" said Mick . Des was a bit unsure about this idea , but since Mike had already started the process he did n't like to interrupt . "" Erm Mike , this wo n't take long , will it ? "" said Des . "" Naaah , three or four hours should do it !! "" said Mike . "" Okay ... "" said Des . "" And then when we get it home , I 'll transfer everything back onto your car and it 'll be as good as new ! "" said Mike . "" Unless you 'd like to pop round to my garage and choose a classy little number from my selection of hot Fords ! "" "" No thanks , "" said Des . They watched as Mike busily took the body of Des's Fiat 126 away from the chassis . "" I ca n't help thinking there must have been a simpler way to get that shed home , "" sighed Des . "" Like asking the garden centre to deliver it ? "" said Mick . "" Or asking Mike to deliver it on a pick-up or something ? "" "" What 's that , Mick ? "" said Mike . "" Oh nothing , nothing , "" said Mick . After about five hours Mike had finally finished . The shed now had wheels , lights , an engine , a chassis , a steering wheel , bumpers and number plates , all donated by Des's Fiat 126 . As the floorpan was taken from the Fiat , the engine had to be placed at the rear of the shed . At the front Mike had removed the door from its hinges , and plonked a seat there . Bolted onto the front was the steering column , pedals and a load of wires . "" Whaddya think !! "" said Mike . "" Pretty nifty , eh ! "" "" Super , "" mumbled Mick . "" Just one thing , "" said Des . "" How am I going to get my car home ? "" He pointed at the shell of his Fiat . "" Umm ... "" said Mike . "" Ca n't you ask the garden centre to deliver it ? "" "" Too late , the garden centre 's closed ! "" exclaimed Mick . "" It 's starting to get dark ! "" "" I know what to do ! "" said Mike . "" I reckon your car 's just small enough ! "" Mike set about removing one of the side walls of the shed . "" Good grief , "" sighed Mick . Mike , Des and Mick heaved the shell of the car inside the shed , and Mike replaced the wall . "" There ! "" said Mike . "" Now all you have to do is drive it home ! "" "" Thank goodness it 's getting dark , hopefully no one will see me ! "" said Des . He carefully went and sat down on the seat at the front of the shed . "" It should drive just like your Fiat ! "" said Mike . "" In other words , terribly ! "" "" Are you sure it 's road legal ? "" said Des . "" Course it is , you 've got lights , seat belt , number plates , tax disc ! "" said Mike . "" What more do you want , an MOT document ?! "" "" Umm ... "" said Des . "" Just start the engine !! "" exclaimed Mike . Des did so , and the familiar rumble of the Fiat 126 engine was heard . "" I 'll give you a lift home , Mick , "" said Mike . "" Thanks Mike , I would n't be seen dead in a thing like that ! "" said Mick . "" Too right , nor me !! "" said Mike . They watched as Des put his foot on the accelerator pedal , and the shed began to trundle through the car park . "" ' Ere Mike , is this as fast as it will go ?! "" shouted Des . Because the shell of his Fiat 126 was weighing the shed down , Des was finding that the engine barely had enough power to propel the shed along at any great speed . "" Sorry Des , not a lot I can do about that !! "" shouted back Mike . "" I 'll see you in the morning to put your car back together again !! "" Mick and Mike whizzed off home in Mike's Cortina , while Des was left trailing in his motorised shed . "" He could at least have put a turbocharger in , "" grumbled Des . Des trundled along the road at a speed that would make a milk float look fast . "" I hope PC Plod's in bed ! "" thought Des . "" I 'm not sure if this is exactly legal ! "" Unfortunately he was n't . Des soon noticed Plod riding behind him on his bike . It did n't take long for Plod to catch him up . "" Excuse me sir , may I have a quick word with you ? "" said Plod . "" Oh no come on , no way was I exceeding the speed limit this time ! "" exclaimed Des . "" Is this your , erm , vehicle , sir ? "" asked Plod . "" Well ... yeeees ... but ... "" said Des . "" Have you a vehicle registration certificate ? "" said Plod . "" It does n't exactly look roadworthy to me . "" "" Oh yes it is , it 's passed its MOT and everything ! "" said Des . "" Can I see your vehicle registration certificate please ? "" asked Plod . "" Err ... tell you what , I have n't got it on me at the moment , so come round my house tomorrow and I 'll show it to you then ! "" "" Right you are , sir , "" said Plod . "" I 'll see you tomorrow . "" He raced off on his bicycle to continue fighting crime . Des decided he would deal with the problem in the morning . When he finally arrived home , as it was now getting very late , he decided to leave the shed parked in the front drive overnight , and hoped no one would steal it ( yeah right , as if anyone 's going to steal a motorised shed ) . The next morning , when Des got up , he looked out of the window and was surprised to see Clive looking at his new shed , weeping . He went outside to see him . "" Clive , what 's the matter ? "" said Des . "" Why me ?! "" moaned Clive . "" Why me ?!?!? "" "" What are you talking about ?! "" said Des . "" Of all the millions of people on this planet , why did I have to end up with you as my neighbour ?!?! "" "" I do n't know what you mean ! "" said Des . "" You ca n't do anything sensible , can you ?! "" exclaimed Clive . "" All you had to do was to buy a new car !! But no , you have to go and buy a shed on wheels !!!! "" "" That 's not my new car , "" said Des . "" It 's not ? "" said Clive . "" It 's my new shed , "" said Des . "" The wheels and engine are only temporary . "" "" Oh thank goodness , "" said Clive . "" So where 's your new car then ? "" "" I 'm not getting a new car !! "" said Des . "" There 's nothing wrong with my Fiat 126 !! I will keep it forever !! "" Clive started weeping again . Just then Mike the Manic Mechanic turned up . "" What 's wrong with him ?! "" said Mike . "" I do n't know , he 's just got some ridiculous in-built prejudice against both Fiat 126s and sheds on wheels , "" said Des . "" Well , whatever , let 's get your car shipshape again ! "" said Mike . "" Or even carshape again ! "" Mike spent the next five hours returning all the car bits and pieces from the shed to the car . "" There , what did I tell you ! "" said Mike . "" It 's as good as new !! "" Des had to admit , his Fiat 126 was now just as it had been before Mike started meddling with it . "" That 'll be Â£ 500 + VAT please , "" said Mike . "" What ?!?! "" exclaimed Des . "" I thought you were doing it as a favour ! "" "" I was ! "" said Mike . "" And an extremely inexpensive favour it was too ! "" Des handed the cash to Mike , who then went back to his garage . Just then PC Plod came along . "" Good afternoon sir , have you managed to produce a vehicle registration certificate for that shed yet ? "" asked Plod . "" PC Plod , what are you talking about , why do I need a vehicle registration certificate for a shed ?! "" Plod stared long and hard at the shed . It was indeed an ordinary , common-or-garden shed ! He scratched his head and then tried rubbing his eyes . "" Err , well , err ... sorry to bother you sir , I did have rather a long night ... "" Plod hurried back to the police station to book a long holiday . Meanwhile Des went over to Mick's house and rang his doorbell . Mick answered . "" Mick , I 've got a problem , "" said Des . Mick groaned . "" You see my new shed ? "" said Des . "" How are we going to get it from the front drive to the back garden ? "" "" How about taking your house apart , lifting the shed across and then putting your house back together ! "" "" That 's a good idea ... naah , it 'd take too long ! "" said Des . "" Quicker to take the shed apart ! "" Des grabbed a reluctant Mick over to his front drive . "" Now this ca n't be too difficult , I 'm sure I 've done it sometime before ... "" said Des . "" All I need is a hammer . Because if I had a hammer , I 'd hammer in the morning , I 'd hammer in the evening , all over this land . "" "" What about the afternoon ? "" said Mick . "" Tea break , "" said Des . He went and fetched a couple of hammers and they set to work taking the shed apart . Then they carried the parts through the garage and into the back garden , which was still covered in moose's heads , skeletons , bird cages etc. By now Mick was exhausted , so Des single-handedly put the shed back together , in its new , permanent position at long last . "" There you go ! "" said Des . "" Looks great , does n't it ! "" "" No , "" said Mick . Des was about to start piling all his junk into the new shed when Mick decided to point something out to him . "" Des , "" said Mick . "" Your new shed looks as though it 's about to collapse ! "" "" Really ? "" said Des . He stared carefully at it . "" Oh yes , you 're right ! "" Following Des's rebuild , all of the walls were now leaning inwards . In fact they were on the brink of falling right in . "" Now I remember why the walls on the old shed always leant inwards !! "" exclaimed Des . "" Tell you what , can I borrow your rake ? """	Prose/Lyrical

311	Carlos Fallanty lost his wife at the time of the Violent Unknown Event . She was a voluble , untidy woman who made her own clothes and washed once a week in the water wrung out of the laundry . She was invaluable to her husband . She looked after his poultry , kept his accounts , and when roused , was as uxorious a wife as Carlos could wish to have . On the night of June 12th of the VUE , Carlos's wife suffered a stroke , and Carlos transferred his affection to a turkey . The VUE Directory records for Carlos a debilitating malfunction of the left ventricle , bone-marrow disease , and save for the VUE immortality clause , would have normally given him six months to live . Carlos had buried his wife in the floor of his greenhouse . The local authorities later had the body exhumed . Now Carlos lived in the greenhouse to keep his turkey company . A fowl-pest epidemic finally erased Carlos's other poultry , and two veterinary officials came to make sure he had burnt or buried all the corpses . Insisting that the one remaining bird should be destroyed as well , the vet promised to compensate Carlos with at least a set of photographs . These are the photographs taken as the vet stalked the bird with his camera , whilst the vet's assistant stalked the bird with a shotgun . Carlos was not happy with the photographs . He is now awaiting trial at Clichy for shooting the vet .	Prose/Lyrical
476	"Beaver Miller - Original Model A also badged as "" Grimston "" Manuals & Parts Lists for most models of Beaver Miller are available Beaver Model A - Click HERE for Detailed Photographs Mk . 1 & Mk . 2 VBRP If any reader has early Beaver Advertising or Maintenance Literature , I would be pleased to hear from them A Beaver Model A owner would like to have contact with fellow owners to discuss head details The Beaver Turret-head vertical miller Model "" A "" was manufactured by Balding Engineering ( originally jobbing engineers ) of the Old Tramways Power Station , Duke Street , Norwich and then Sweet Briar Road in the same city . A number of this model were also badged as "" Grimston "" ( a London machine-tool manufacturer and merchant ) and sometimes lacked the cast Beaver badge on the right-hand side of the main column ; the paint finish was also unusual on the Grimston version , a "" splatter "" mix of dark grey , green and red not dissimilar to that also used on some American ROTEX millers of the same era . In its original form , as introduced during the early 1950s , this little miller proved to be a compact , versatile machine equally at home in the toolroom or on the shop floor - and absolutely ideal when its industrial life was over , for the workshop of the enthusiastic amateur . In 1957 it was succeeded by the very much larger and heavier MK . 1 and Mk 2 and "" VBRP "" models , details of which ( today the most common "" Beaver "" on the used market ) can be seen here . In the 1980s , on the back of considerable success in exporting the VBRP range , the company opened a new factory in Peterborough to manufacture a range of CNC lathes to compliment the CNC millers and CNC machining centres already in production ; unfortunately the severe recession in manufacturing industry of 1992 ( when demand for machine tools fell by 50 % in 3 months ) caused the company to close .. The original 1950s miller had a 28 "" x 6 "" table ( with three 9 / 16 "" T slots ) a longitudinal travel of 15 "" , a cross feed of 7.5 "" and a vertical movement of 13.75 "" . A table power-feed motor was fitted as standard and drove a 4-speed gear box ; to change the rate of table feed "" pick-off "" gears were used where operator removed a side panel , pulled off the gears on two studs ( they were retained by snap-on wire springs ) and changed them for another pair from the four supplied . The head was driven by a simple and reliable two-stage V-belt arrangement with an adjustable intermediate pulley carried in a T slot ; an over-centre toggle lever released the belt tension to change speeds and the whole of the belt run was guarded by a rather fragile hinged , cast-aluminium cover . The head swung on top of the column , slid in and out of its housing and swivelled through 90 degrees each way - allowing the spindle nose to be brought to within 3.5 "" of the column face or moved away to give a maximum clearance of 9.75 "" . The quill , with 3 "" of travel and a No. 30 International fitting , was fitted with both fine and quick-action feeds and driven by a 0.75 hp 3-phase motor through 7 speeds in two ranges arranged ( through the intermediate pulley ) of 200 , 330 , and 500 on Low-Range and 350 , 1420 , 2200 , 3600 rpm on High . The quill movement was measured by a vertical ruler and adjustable micrometer dial - and fitted with a very useful screw-adjusted ' pre-set ' depth stop . Because the electric motor mounts directly onto the back of a Beaver "" headbar "" , changing it is a very simple operation . The table power-feed motor , however , is flange-mounted to the back of the knee - and is not such an easy prospect for modification ; however , this type of small 3-phase motor is usually amenable to being run on a single-phase supply by using the old trick of linking two of the three-phase terminals with a suitable capacitor . For the home or smaller professional workshop the Beaver Mill "" A "" is one of the few machines that combines quality , size and functionality in just the right proportions . A Universal version , the "" AH "" , was also manufactured - but this is a comparatively rare machine and , unaccountably , used a completely different type of vertical head . Balding also built a 4.5 "" x 20 "" backgeared , screwcutting lathe of conventional design but robust construction . of which details can be foun"	Information/Explanation

1385	"If a cracker is trying to break into the account by trying to guess the password , a changed password makes it difficult for the attacker . If an account has already been breached , the password expiration will help prevent or at least raise suspicions that there is an issue . With a good enterprise password management tool , such as Avatier's Password Station , the real user will get notifications about needing to change their password before it is expired which the cracker may never see . Finally , if the account has been breached and the cracker changes the password , the user may notice they ca n't get into their account anymore and this may lead to an investigation . Those are all good and valuable benefits . However , on the other side are a few major problems : Many users will start using passwords like "" howdy1 "" . Then , when the expiration hits , they just change it to "" howdy2 "" . This means that if the password is ever cracked , it is likely the cracker will be able to guess future passwords as well . Other users will start writing down their passwords because they ca n't remember them anymore . The shorter the password expiration , the greater the number of Help Desk calls related to forgotten passwords will be . So what can be done to get the benefits of an enterprise password manager while minimizing the problems ? First , the number of different passwords in the organization needs to be considered . A company with one Windows domain is going to have fewer issues than a company with a mix of Windows , ERP , Databases , Unix , Mainframe , and so on . When multiple systems are in play , the first thing to do is to implement a password synchronization product , such as Password Station . This will enable users to only need to remember one password for all the systems instead of several passwords . This increases the likelihood of a good password being chosen and remembered . Second , password history can be used to prevent a user from reusing the same few passwords over and over again . Some systems can enforce this natively , but having your password synchronization software handle this capability will ensure all systems are in scope . The appropriate strength of the enterprise password management software policy is also critical to success . A product like Password Bouncer allows admins to utilize an automated password reset tool to enforce policies that prevents users from setting very simple passwords that are easy to crack yet simple enough that users will not have to write them down to be remembered . Finally , the time frame of the password expiration needs to be considered . Obviously , a password policy that is daily or weekly is going to lead to problems . At the other extreme , a policy that only enforces changes yearly is probably not strong enough . A reasonable time frame of password expiration is anywhere from 1 to 6 months depending on the compliance and cyber security threats to an organization . The complexity of the enterprise password management software policy needs to be factored in . If the policy is complex , the password expiration could be longer . If the policy is very simple , then the expiration should be shorter ."	Promotion
1109	"The 2016 Summer Olympics ( Portuguese : Jogos OlÃ­mpicos de VerÃ£o de 2016 ) , [ a ] officially known as the Games of the XXXI Olympiad and commonly known as Rio 2016 , was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , from 5 August to 21 August 2016 . The lead-up to these Games was marked by controversies , including the instability of the country's federal government ; health and safety concerns surrounding the Zika virus and significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay ; and a doping scandal involving Russia , which has affected the participation of its athletes in the Games . The United States topped the medal table for the fifth time in the past six Summer Olympics , winning the most golds ( 46 ) and most medals overall ( 121 ) , as well as its 1 , 000th Olympic gold medal overall . Great Britain finished second and became the first country in the history of the modern Olympics to increase its tally of medals in the subsequent games after being the host nation . China finished third . Host country Brazil won seven gold medals , its most at any single Summer Olympics , finishing in thirteenth place . Fiji , Jordan , Kosovo , Puerto Rico , Singapore , Tajikistan , Ivory Coast and Vietnam each won their first gold medals , as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes ( from Kuwait ) . The bidding process for the 2016 Olympic Games was officially launched on 16 May 2007 . [ 4 ] The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) by 13 September 2007 , confirming their intention to bid . Completed official bid files , containing answers to a 25-question IOC form , were to be submitted by each applicant city by 14 January 2008 . Four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist on 4 June 2008 : Chicago , Madrid , Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo , which hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics and will host again in 2020 . The IOC did not promote Doha to the candidature phase , despite scoring higher than selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro , because of their intent of hosting the Olympics in October , outside of the IOC's sporting calendar . Prague and Baku also failed to make the cut . [ 5 ] Nawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission , having also chaired the evaluation commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bids . The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009 . They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September , one month before elections . [ 6 ] Many restrictions are in place designed to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or influencing directly the 115 voting members . Cities may not invite any IOC member to visit nor may they send anything that could be construed as a gift . Nonetheless , bidding cities invest large sums in their PR and media programs in an attempt to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support , support from sports media and general international media . "" Ultimately , you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people , perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense . It is not just about getting ads out there but it is about a targeted and very carefully planned campaign . The final voting was held on 2 October 2009 , in Copenhagen with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro perceived as favourites to land the games . Chicago and Tokyo were eliminated after the first and second rounds of voting , respectively , while Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid heading into the final round . The lead held and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of 2016 Summer Olympics . On 26 June 2011 , it was reported on AroundTheRings.com that Roderlei Generali , the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games , resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC . This comes just five months after CCO FlÃ¡vio Pestana quit for personal reasons . [ 9 ] Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics . Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO . [ 10 ] Events took place at eighteen existing venues , nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games , and seven temporary venues . [ 11 ] Each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters : Barra , Copacabana , Deodoro , and MaracanÃ£ . The same was done for the 2007 Pan American Games . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park . [ 11 ] Athletes could access their venues in shorter than 10 minutes and about 75 percent could do so in less than 25 minutes . Of the 34 competition locales , eight have undergone permanent works , seven are limited , and nine are perpetual legacy venues . [ 14 ] The largest venue at the games in terms of seating capacity was the 74 , 738-seat MaracanÃ£ Stadium , which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals . [ 11 ] The second largest stadium was the 60 , 000-seat EstÃ¡dio OlÃ­mpico JoÃ£o Havelange , which hosted track and field events . [ 11 ] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history . Fittings included about 80,000 chairs , 70,000 tables , 29,000 mattresses , 60,000 clothes hangers , 6,000 television sets and 10,000 smartphones . [ 15 ] The Barra Olympic Park is a cluster of nine sporting venues in Barra da Tijuca , in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . The site of the Olympic Park was formerly occupied by the AutÃ³dromo Internacional Nelson Piquet , also known as JacarepaguÃ¡ . [ 16 ] As well as the EstÃ¡dio OlÃ­mpico JoÃ£o Havelange and MaracanÃ£ and in Rio de Janeiro , football matches took place at 5 venues in the cities of SÃ£o Paulo , Belo Horizonte , Salvador , BrasÃ­lia and Manaus . Rio's historical downtown is undergoing a large-scale urban waterfront revitalization project called Porto Maravilha . [ 19 ] It covers 5 km 2 ( 1 . 9 sq mi ) in area . The project aims to redevelop the port area , increasing the city center's attractiveness and enhancing Rio's competitive position in the global economy . The urban renovation involves : 700 km ( 430 mi ) of public networks for water supply , sanitation , drainage , electricity , gas and telecom ; 4 km ( 2 . 5 mi ) of tunnels ; 70 km ( 43 mi ) of roads ; 650 km 2 ( 250 sq mi ) of sidewalks ; 17 km ( 11 mi ) of bike path ; 15,000 trees ; three sanitation treatment plants . As part of this renovation , a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to RodoviÃ¡ria Novo Rio . It was due to open in April 2016 . [ 20 ] The Games required more than 200 kilometres of security fencing . A 15,000 square metre warehouse in Barra da Tijuca in western Rio was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village . A second warehouse of 90,000 square metres , located in Duque de Caxias near the roads that provide access to the venues , contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events . [ 15 ] The medal design was unveiled on 15 June 2016 ; they were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil . The bronze and silver medals contained 30 % recycled materials , while the gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted using means that met a series of sustainability criteria , such as being extracted without the use of mercury . The medals feature a wreath design , while the obverse , as is traditional , features Nike , the Greek goddess of victory . They were accompanied by a wooden carrying box , while medallists also received a trophy of the Games' emblem . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Future Arena , a temporary venue whose modules will be reconstructed into schools . As an aspect of its bid , Rio's organizing committee committed to a focus on sustainability and environmental protection as a theme of these Games , going on to dub them a "" Green Games for a Blue Planet "" . [ 23 ] Organizers intended to , as legacy projects , introduce a wider array of public transport options , upgrade the infrastructure of the favelas to provide improved transport and access to utilities , upgrade Rio's sewer system in order to remediate the level of pollution in the Guanabara Bay . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] and plant 24 million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games . However , some of these projects were met with delays or faced with economic shortfalls , which led some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them . [ 23 ] [ 25 ] The focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols : the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations in order to reduce emissions , and utilizes a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in lieu of a larger body of flames . [ 26 ] The bronze and silver medals , as well as ribbons on all medals , incorporate recycled materials , [ 21 ] [ 22 ] and athletes were not presented with flowers during medal ceremonies , as had been traditionally done at prior Olympics ( although flowers were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations ) . Organizers considered the practice to be wasteful since they were often thrown away , and "" would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate "" if kept . The podiums were also designed so that their materials could be recycled to make furniture . [ 22 ] [ 27 ] The Future Arena , host of handball competitions , was designed as a modular temporary venue whose components can be reconstructed to build schools . [ 28 ] The Olympic flame was lit at the temple of Hera in Olympia on 21 April 2016 , the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay . On 27 April the flame was handed over to the Brazilian organizers at a ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens . A brief stop was made in Switzerland to visit the IOC headquarters and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne as well as the United Nations Office at Geneva . [ 30 ] The ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014 , all of which were sold in Brazilian reais ( BRL ) . A total of 7.5 million tickets were to be sold in total , with ticket prices ranging from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony . About 3.8 million of these tickets were available for BRL 70 or less . [ 32 ] [ 33 ] The Olympic cauldron was lit by Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima , the men's marathon bronze medallist at the 2004 Summer Olympics who was also awarded the Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship by the IOC after being attacked by a spectator and losing his lead . The cauldron was originally expected to be lit by Brazilian footballer PelÃ© , but he declined to participate due to health problems . [ 35 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] A public cauldron was lit in front of the CandelÃ¡ria Church by a 14-year-old participant in Rio's Vila Olimpica program â which provides access to training facilities to disadvantaged youth . [ 40 ] [ 41 ] The 2016 Summer Olympic programme featured 28 sports encompassing 306 events . The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses . In April 2008 , the IOC began accepting applications for two new sports to be introduced to the Olympic programme , which included baseball and softball ( which were dropped in 2005 ) , karate , squash , golf , roller sports , and rugby union all applied to be included . Formal presentations were held for the IOC executive board in June 2009 . [ 42 ] In August , the executive board initially gave its approval to rugby sevens â a seven-player version of rugby union â by a majority vote , thus removing baseball , roller sports , and squash from contention . Among the remaining three â golf , karate , and softball â the board approved golf as a result of consultation . The final decision regarding the remaining two sports was made on 9 October 2009 , the final day of the 121st IOC Session . A new system was in place at this session ; a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Participating National Olympic Committees [ edit ] 2016 Summer Olympics team numbers . All 206 National Olympic Committees have qualified at least one athlete . [ citation needed ] The first three nations to qualify athletes for the Games were Germany , Great Britain , and the Netherlands who each qualified four athletes for the team dressage by winning medals in the team event at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games . [ 48 ] As host nation , Brazil has received automatic entry for some sports including in all cycling disciplines and six places for weightlifting events . [ 49 ] [ 50 ] The 2016 Summer Olympics are the first games in which Kosovo and South Sudan are eligible to participate . Bulgarian and Russian weightlifters were banned from Rio Olympics for numerous anti-doping violations . [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Kuwait was banned in October 2015 for the second time in five years over government interference in the country's Olympic committee . [ 53 ] Due to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait , participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes . In November 2015 , Russia was provisionally suspended from all international athletic competitions by the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) following a World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) report into a doping program in the country . [ 56 ] The IAAF announced that it would allow individual Russian athletes to apply for "" exceptional eligibility "" to participate in the Games as "" neutral "" athletes , if it were independently verified that they had not engaged in doping nor in the Russian doping program . [ 57 ] On 24 July 2016 , the IOC rejected the IAAF and WADA's recommendations to allow clean athletes to compete neutrally , stating that the Olympic Charter "" does not foresee such ' neutral athletes ' "" and that it was up to each country's National Olympic Committee to decide which athletes would be competing . [ 58 ] During the Games some countries and continents had a national house . These temporary meeting places for supporters , athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro . [ 59 ] This is currently based on the schedule released on the same day as ticket sales began , 31 March 2015 . [ 60 ] Twenty-seven world records and ninety-one Olympic records were set during the 2016 Summer Olympics . The records were set in archery , athletics , canoeing , cycling track , modern pentathlon , rowing , shooting , swimming and weightlifting . The medals designed for the Olympics . They were designed to be environmentally friendly from recycled materials . The top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below . Host nation Brazil finished in 13th place with a total of 19 medals ( 7 gold , 6 silver , and 6 bronze ) . To sort this table by nation , total medal count , or any other column , click on the icon next to the column title . A number of events , most notably in aquatics , beach volleyball , and track and field , were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 22 : 00 to 00 : 00 BRT . These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC ( due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics , the IOC has sometimes allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible ) , as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo . As BrasÃ­lia time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone , certain marquee events were scheduled so they could occur during the lucrative U.S. primetime hours ( traditionally 20 : 00 to 23 : 00 ET , or 21 : 00 to 00 : 00 BRT ) , allowing them to be broadcast live on the U.S. east coast as opposed to being delayed . This practice was also to the benefit of domestic broadcaster Rede Globo , which elected to not preempt its widely viewed lineup of primetime telenovelas for the Games . However , Globo did preempt its telenovelas for the opening ceremony ; a Brazilian television critic noted that Globo very rarely preempts its telenovelas . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] The creative director for the ceremony was Rosa MagalhÃ£es . [ 67 ] Amid heavy rainfall , the ceremony began with interpretive dancers representing various landmarks in the host city . Martinho da Vila then performed a rendition of the classic song "" Carinhoso ( pt ) "" by Pixinguinha . In another segment , introducing the athletes , pop singer Roberta SÃ¡ channeled Carmen Miranda , the fruit-headdress-wearing , midcentury Hollywood diva who endures as a beloved camp figure . The Parade of Flags followed shortly after a choir of 27 children , representing the states of Brazil , sang the Brazilian national anthem . Olympic Broadcasting Services served as the host broadcaster for these Games ; produced from a total of 52 mobile units , OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders ; for the first time in Olympic history , digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage . The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster . [ 68 ] NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games , including the opening ceremony and selected events , in 8K resolution video . Additionally , expanding upon a 180-degree trial at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics , 85 hours of video content were originated in 360-degree virtual reality formats . [ 69 ] In the United States , NBC offered 4K content , downconverted from the 8K footage and with HDR and Dolby Atmos support , to participating television providers . [ 70 ] Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio , NBC and Sky New Zealand staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS . [ 68 ] In August 2009 , the IOC reached a deal to sell domestic broadcast rights to the 2016 Summer Olympics to Grupo Globo . Replacing Rede Record , the deal covers free-to-air coverage on Rede Globo , pay TV , and digital rights to the Games . In turn , Globo sub-licensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record , along with Rede Bandeirantes . IOC board member Richard CarriÃ³n described the agreement as "" unprecedented "" , touting that "" by working with Brazil's leading media organizations , we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region . There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast , both during and outside Games time , and Brazilians will have more choice of how , when and where they follow their Olympic Games . "" [ 71 ] Vinicius ( left ) , the mascot of the 2016 Summer Olympics , and Tom ( right ) , the mascot of the 2016 Summer Paralympics . The official emblems of the Games can be seen on the mascots' chests . The official mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 24 November 2014 . They were created by Sao Paulo - based animation company Birdo . [ 72 ] The Olympic mascot Vinicius , named after musician Vinicius de Moraes , represents Brazilian wildlife and carries design traits of cats , monkeys , and birds . [ 72 ] According to their fictional backgrounds , the mascots "" were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games . "" [ 73 ] Brand director Beth Lula stated that the mascots are intended to reflect the diversity of Brazil's culture and people . [ 74 ] The names of the mascots were determined by a public vote whose results were announced on 14 December 2014 ; the names , which reference the co-writers of the song "" The Girl from Ipanema "" , won over two other sets of names , tallying 44 percent of 323,327 votes . [ 75 ] At the Olympic wrestling events , coaches were given plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a referee's call . [ 76 ] The official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by the Brazilian agency TatÃ­l Design and unveiled on 31 December 2010 , winning in a competition against 139 agencies . [ 77 ] The logo represents three figures joined at their arms and feet , with the overall shape reflecting that of Sugarloaf Mountain . The emblem was also designed to have a three-dimensional form , which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the "" first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics . "" [ 78 ] The logo has been noted as evoking Henri Matisse ' s painting Dance . There were also allegations by the Colorado-based Telluride Foundation that the logo had been plagiarized from its own . While also consisting of several figures linked in motion , the Telluride Foundation logo contains four figures . This is not the first time that the foundation had alleged plagiarism of its logo by a Brazilian event ; in 2004 , the linked figures element had been copied for the logo of Carnival celebrations in Salvador . Gelli defended the allegations , stating that the concept of figures linked in embrace was not inherently original as it was "" an ancient reference "" and "" in the collective unconscious "" . Gelli cited Dance as an influence of the logo's concept , and stated that the designers had intentionally aimed to make the interpretation of the concept as dissimilar to others as possible . [ 79 ] An ongoing outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil has raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors . Organizers plan to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues to prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed . [ 80 ] Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area , and sewage treatment was being improved in preparation for the Games . [ 81 ] In May 2016 , a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the World Health Organization , calling upon them to , according to co-author Arthur Caplan , have "" an open , transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil "" . The WHO dismissed the request , stating that "" cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics will not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus "" , and that there was "" no public health justification "" for postponing them . [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] Some athletes did not attend the Games because of the epidemic . [ 85 ] [ 86 ] On 2 September 2016 , the World Health Organization reported that there were no confirmed cases of Zika among athletes or visitors during the Olympics . [ 87 ] The Guanabara Bay , whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions , is heavily polluted . Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and slums along the coast . Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue . Officials promised at the Earth Summit in 1992 that they would begin to address the pollution but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient . As an aspect of their bid for the Games , Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay . [ 88 ] [ 89 ] However , some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues . [ 24 ] Prior to these efforts , only 17 % of Rio's sewage was treated ; [ 90 ] this raw sewage also leaked into the bay . Although Mayor of Rio Eduardo Paes stated that the city may not be able to reach its goal of having 80 % of sewage treated , [ 91 ] at least 60 % of sewage was treated by March 2016 , with a projected goal of 65 % of sewage being treated by the time the Olympics started . [ 92 ] In 2014 , Operation Car Wash , an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil , uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras . In early 2015 , a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil , triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair . By early 2016 , the scandal had escalated into a full-blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff , but also former President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , resulting in massive demonstrations all over the country involving millions of protesters , [ 93 ] both anti and pro-Rousseff . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] At the same time , Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the 1990s , raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared for the Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop . On 12 May , President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for 180 days , after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate , thus Vice President Michel Temer acted as acting president during the Games . [ 96 ] Since the award of the 2016 Olympics to Rio de Janeiro , the city's crime problems received more attention . Rio's mayor said that there are "" big issues "" facing the city in securing the Games from violence . However , he also said that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process . [ 97 ] The governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro also highlighted the fact that London faced security problems , with a terrorist attack occurring on the day following the IOC session that chose the city to host the 2012 Olympic Games . The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers ( 14 , 800 Army ; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force ) , in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January , would act during the Olympic Games . [ 98 ] On 21 July 2016 , two weeks before the scheduled start of the Games , Brazilian Federal Police broke up an Islamic jihadist terrorist ring , with 10 ISIS associates arrested and two more on the run . [ 99 ] While the whole city underwent major infrastructure improvements , there were concerns that some of the projects would never materialise . [ 100 ] On 21 April â the day that the Olympic torch was lit â a 50 metres ( 164 ft ) section of the Tim Maia bike path , crossing the Oscar Niemeyer Avenue in SÃ£o Conrado neighborhood and a part of the legacy of the games , was hit by a giant wave and collapsed , causing the death of two pedestrians and injuries to three more . [ 101 ] [ 102 ] The athlete's village has been described as the largest in Olympic history , but two weeks before the Olympics opened , officials also described it as "" unliveable "" and unsafe because of major plumbing and electrical hazards , blocked toilets , leaking pipes , exposed wiring , darkened stairwells where no lighting has been installed , and dirty floors . More than 500 employees of the local Olympic committee worked to fix the problems reported by the delegations . [ 103 ] In November 2015 , Russia ' s track and field team was provisionally suspended from all international athletic competitions by the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) following a World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) report into a doping program in the country . [ 56 ] On 18 July 2016 , an independent investigation commissioned by WADA reported that Russia's Ministry of Sport and Federal Security Service had operated a "" state-dictated "" system to implement an extensive doping program and to cover up positive samples . Based on the finding the International Olympic Committee called for an emergency meeting to consider banning Russia from the Summer Olympics . [ 104 ] The IOC decided against completely banning Russian participation and instead decided to set additional , stricter requirements for all Russian participants entered into the Olympic Games . [ 105 ] Originally Russia submitted a list of 389 athletes for competition . On 7 August 2016 , the IOC cleared 278 athletes , while 111 were removed because of the scandal .

374	"Reduce Cancer Reoccurrence , Wheatgerm Extract , Cancer : The Wheatgerm Extract That May Help Reduce Cancer Reoccurrence Cancer treatment has come a long way since the use of mustard gas derivatives in the early 1900s - or has it ? When doctors discovered during World War I that mustard gas destroyed bone marrow , they began to experiment with it as a way to kill cancer cells . Although they had little success with the mustard gas , it did pave the way for modern chemotherapy - which involves the most toxic and poisonous substances anyone deliberately puts in his body . These treatments kill much more than cancer cells - they have a devastating effect even on healthy ones . Sometimes it seems as if only a miracle could provide a cure that 's both safe and effective . And a miracle is just what Dr. Mate Hidvegi believed he found when he patented Avemar . Studies have shown that Avemar , a fermented wheatgerm extract , helps reduce cancer reoccurrence , possibly speed up cancer cell death and helps the immune system identify cancer cells for attack . A miracle in the making Back in World War I , Dr. Albert Szent-GyÃ¶rgyi ( a Nobel Prize recipient in 1937 for his discovery of vitamin C ) had seen the effects of mustard gas personally and was determined to find a safer alternative for cancer treatment . His goal was to prevent the rapid reproduction that is characteristic of cancer cells . He theorised that supplemental quantities of naturally occurring compounds in wheatgerm called DMBQ would help to chaperone cellular metabolism , allowing healthy cells to follow a normal course but prohibiting potentially cancerous ones from growing and spreading . His early experiments , published in the 1960s , confirmed his theory . But then the science community shifted its focus to killing cancer outright . It was n ' t until the fall of communism in Hungary in 1989 - when scientists were allowed for the first time to pursue independent , personal interests - that Dr. Hidvegi picked up where Szent-GyÃ¶rgyi left off . He was able to patent a technique of fermenting wheat germ with baker's yeast . He named this fermented product Avemar and it became the standard compound for research and later commercialisation because it assured a longer shelf life while maintaining its live food status . Reduce cancer reoccurrence Since 1996 , over 100 studies done on Avemar have impressed oncologists and cancer researchers . Studies have shown that when Avemar is used as an adjunct treatment , it enhances the effects of the standard treatment agents . It 's particularly effective in reducing the chances of cancer reoccurrence . In a controlled study , 170 subjects with primary colorectal cancer either had surgery and standard care with chemotherapy or the same plus 9g of Avemar taken once a day . Only 3 per cent of the people in the Avemar group experienced a reoccurrence , vs. more than 17 per cent of those in the chemo-only group . The Avemar group also showed a 67 per cent reduction in metastasis and a 62 per cent reduction in deaths . 1 In a randomized study , 46 stage III melanoma patients with a high risk of reoccurrence either had surgery and standard care with chemotherapy or surgery plus standard care and 9g of Avemar taken once a day . Those taking Avemar showed approximately a 50 per cent reduction in risk of progression . 2 Avemar also reduced the frequency and severity of many common side-effects , including nausea , fatigue , weight loss and immune suppression . Avemar speeds cancer cell death The second way Avemar works against cancer is to help keep cancer cells from repairing themselves . Cancer cells reproduce quickly and chaotically , producing many breaks and other mistakes in the cellular structure . Because of this , cancer cells need a lot of the enzyme known as PARP ( poly-ADP-ribose ) to help repair breaks in DNA before the cells divide . For daily reports on the very latest health breakthroughs , join our FREE daily email service : It is thought that without adequate PARP , cancer cells can not complete DNA replication . When there 's no PARP to repair the damage , an enzyme called Caspase-3 initiates programmed cell death . Avemar has been shown to potentially speed up the death of cancer cells by helping inhibit the production of PARP and enhancing the production of Caspase-3 . 3 US researchers at UCLA also showed that Avemar may reduce the production of RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) and DNA associated with the rapid reproduction of cancer cells . It also helps restore normal pathways of cell metabolism and may increase the production of RNA and DNA associated with healthy cells . 4 Undercover cancer cells exposed Avemar may also act as a biological bounty hunter for hidden cancer cells . Healthy cells have a surface molecule called MHC-1 that tells natural killer ( NK ) cells not to attack . Virally infected cells do n't display this molecule , which makes them targets . However , cancer cells have also been shown to display the surface molecule MHC-1 , which means that cancer cells may actually be able to hide from NK cells . Avemar is thought to help the immune system identify cancer cells for attack by suppressing their ability to generate this MHC-1 mask , which allows the NK cells to recognize it as a target for attack . 5 What to take for best results The Avemar product is an instant drink mix called AvÃ© , which combines Avemar with natural orange flavouring and fructose in pre-measured packets . As a dietary supplement , the recommended usage is one packet per day mixed with 8oz of cold water . You should consume it within 30 minutes of mixing a batch . Also note that it 's a good idea to take AvÃ© one hour before or after a meal and two hours before or after any drugs or other dietary supplements . If you weigh over 200 pounds ( 14 stone ) , use two packets per day . If you weigh less than 100 pounds ( 7 stone ) , only use half of a packet per day . Although some people reported uneasiness in their stomachs during the first few days of using Avemar , the effect only lasted a few days . No vomiting , diarrhoea , or any other symptoms were reported . Contraindications : Since this is a wheat product , there is the potential for allergic response . Avemar should not be consumed by people who have had an organ or tissue transplant , those who have malabsorption syndrome , or those with allergies to foods containing gluten , such as wheat , rye , oats and barley . It 's also not recommended for people with fructose intolerance or hypersensitivity to gluten , wheatgerm , or any of the components or ingredients of this product . If you suffer from bleeding ulcers , you should stop using Avemar two days before undergoing a barium X-ray contrast examination and resume taking it two days after the completion of the examination . This precaution is necessary because wheatgerm contains lectin , which can potentially cause red blood cells to clump . If you are currently taking medications or have any adverse health conditions , you should consult with your pharmacist or physician before taking Avemar . Sources : 1 .

588	"Posted : Sun Oct 20 , 2013 11 : 48 am Hi guys . It has been brought to my attention that some folks can not find sections 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 of ' the Age of Dusk . Instead of scouring the various forums and sub-forums this story has been pasted during its transition fromt he BL forums to the Bolthole , I have elected to simply re-post the missing sections in this thread . Additional Background Information 2 : The Greater Good drives on . By the dawn on the 61st Millennium , the Tau had truly learned their place in the great tumult of the galaxy . Spread across a thousand sectors , and hundreds of sept colonies and systems , the Tau were an industrial powerhouse of the like not seen in almost ten thousand years . Their technology had reached beyond what the original Tau , in their naive ignorance , believed was possible , and client races by the dozens have integrated into Tau culture ( with varying degrees of success . The Hu ' sta Gue ' Vesa Colonies of To ' Kann had become almost identical to most Sept worlds , filled with beautiful white cities and wondrous technologies , while the Kroot worlds remain semi-civilised auxiliaries , still on the fringes of society despite their ancient pedigree . ) The furious process of Terra-forming enacted throughout the second Age of Strife has worked in their favour ; while other cultures faltered and disintegrated , the Tau fashioned themselves into an ever harder force . Their cutting edge weaponry was awe-inspiring to behold ; it was noted during the protracted war with the Zaffian independent human league ( in 473 . M55 ) , how their newest gunships could move to fast and strike so lethally , entire battalions of foes were vanquished before the order to retaliate could be given , their armoured columns instantly shattered into molten slag by a hundred thousand simultaneous missile barrages , followed up by direct engagement by agile battlesuits who never seemed to miss . Yet , as we have seen , all this technology was painfully necessary simply for the Tau Meta-Empire to survive . In the Northern and Eastern sept clusters of the empire , and beyond , titanic forces were arrayed against them . A great silver tide threatened to drown them all , and undo their bitterly difficult expansion before it could be completed . The Necrons ( or the Mont ' Ka ' Vesa , as they were known by the Tau ) were at full gold mobilisation . Titanic spider constructs bestrode worlds , drinking them dry of life , before spewing green oblivion into their fleets . Endless tides of Necrons warriors and Immortals lived up to their undying titles ; the constructs repaired almost all damage , and those necrons truly destroyed were ripped from the very air , repaired by a million machines upon their tomb worlds , and spat back to another war front to fight again , all in the space of hours ! In early phases , the Tau lost hundreds of worlds to these terrors , entire planetary populations vanquished before they could be evacuated to safety . Billions died , and the Tau empire wept for these horrendous losses . The Water Caste propaganda machine had a pitifully easy task uniting their entire empire against this nightmare ; made all the simpler when even the most secure sept-dwelling Tau from the safest most peaceful septs , only had to look into the sky and notice that stars were vanishing from the skies before their own eyes . For this menace was not some petty dynast looking for land and a galaxy to rule . It was a force of utter oblivion , led by the personification of such nightmarish ideals ; the Nightbringer himself . Many times had the Tau mobilised full battlefleets of the new ' Avenger ' class warships and millions of Fire Caste warriors , to fight the Necrons in open war , only for a great black cloud to enter the system , and drink the local star dry . This doomed a system , and made defending such places pointless . Many were the solemn poems written at this time upon Elsy ' eir , about the terrible agonising decisions Sphere-Maintainence Commanders had to face by leaving so-called ' dark-septs ' to their doom . Yet , by 972 . M55 , the Tau had somewhat found a method of holding the darkness at arms length . Munitions were developed that burrowed into Necron constructs , and continually burned no matter how many times they were repaired . This forced Tomb Worlds to abandon seriously damaged Necrons and to build entire new Necron bodies for the consciousnesses stored in the nodal grid . This took time , and allowed Tau Sept colonies to summon aid through the immense waystation grid network . When Necron forces transported their swarming monoliths upon a planet or station , they found the Tau were ready with all the fearsome weaponry their Empire could fashion . Fighting in such wars , with such hideous and unthinkable powerful weapons was always a harrowing experience , and Earth Caste specialist hospitals were set up by the thousands to deal with the influx of battle-damaged and mentally scarred soldiers evacuated from such warzones . In many cases , these hospitals became euthanasia centres , due to the unnatural and sometimes impossible conditions of some soldiers . The things they saw could not be unseen , and their bodies and minds were consumed by the revelations that gnawed upon their very souls . The Tau had also made a grand alliance with their old foes , the diverse and fickle Thexian Trade Empire , which had also suffered painfully at the Necrons ' silvered hands . The Concord between the two great rivals was binding so long as the Necrons remained ' a credible and pressing danger to the survival of the overall galactic community ' . Little could the two factions realise how many thousands of years this would remain the case . One must also note that though the Thexian Elite did sign this treaty , many of their less controllable elements still cause problems in northern Sept districts , where the rule of the Tau is lax ... The great Necron wars affected a great many aspects of the Empire throughout its history . There was much desperation amongst the corporate leaders of the Grand Septs ( such as T ' au and Bork ' an in particular ) . New weapons and means of combating the silver dread were demanded at all times . In particular , the dreadful loss of life resulting from the war ( an attrition rate of almost 80 % throughout the years 387 . M54-999 . M57 ) was widely decried by most non-military elements of the Empire . Bork ' an made tentative attempts to develop pilot-less drone controlled Battlesuits for mass-production . However , such machines had slow reactions , and were generally deemed useless . Reluctantly , the secret projects which had de = populated the ancient world of N ' dras were ordered by the council of Aun ' Va to continue their old research into hyper-sophisticated drone processing and development . This led to the terrible events of the N ' dras conflagration in 555 . M57 , but we shall come back to this at some future date . However , before that date , the N ' drasian ' Cold-suits ' became an essential element in future Tau conflicts ; they could be deployed by the millions directly from Demiurg factory vessels , into combat . The distinctive blue-grey form of the N ' drasian XV333-78 combat battlesuits were far more slender and manoeuvrable than their predecessors due to their lack of a pilot . They could accelerate more quickly and were more agile , as they did n't risk the well-being of their occupants . Also , each suit could contain greater payloads and more weapons and more complex targeting systems , and had extensive sophisticated drone networking systems , allowing drones to become an extension of their own minds . What was more was that rather than being mere programs , the CPUs of the XV333's could actually think for themselves ; Artificial Intelligences . A whispered abomination in the old spluttering cultures of the Gue ' Vesa , the Tau did not fear these thinking machines . Their arrogance and ignorance would later serve as a warning to all . Beware the Ghost in the Machine ... On 397.893 . M58 , the single most important development in Tau culture and their wider society came to pass . It wa son this day , upon the world of Jaa ' Vorl , that a Tau child known to history as Kor-Pivin , was the first Tau to undergo experimental Earth Caste genetic tests . These long and gruelling tests had be begun barely seven kai ' rotaa ( each equivalent to 50 Terran Days ) previously , after reports across the empire spoke of strange Tau who could perceive the world in a way never before seen , and could even manipulate local physical constants to a minor degree . On some of the more far distant Sept colonies , such talents would often go unexplored , but the pattern began to reoccur within the more metropolitan sept worlds and sept-dominated colonies . Once the tests were completed , the results were revealed to the Earth caste much to their astonishment . They had confirmed the existence of the first ever Tau psyker . This information was of course withheld from the majority of Tau society for almost a hundred years . By the time the Ethereals had properly ' prepared ' society for this revelation , Vior ' la and several other military academies across the Empire had already performed their own hunts for psykers ( or ' vortex singularities ' as the Tau propaganda machine hurried to call them to avoid unpleasant associations with the destructive and insane warp-user strains of humanity , who had caused so much destruction of the millennia ) , and had gathered them together into secret breeding programs . In typical Tau fashion , these psykers began to be developed into a distinct caste , the M ' yen caste ( aptly translated as ' the unforeseen ' caste , as one could easily argue none amongst the Tau predicted such a development ) . Clad in strange purple robes , and utilising odd energy focussing crystals in their ornamentation and armaments , these figures became a strange and unsettling presence within Tau society . Most were hastily deployed to the eternal Necron front , bolstering the other psychic races of the grand alliance , who were essential in keeping the silver menace at bay . The rest were used by the Ethereals , to ensure the compliance and adoration of sept worlds and those living within them , to the Greater Good . The M ' yen ' Vre were the perfect tools for the Ethereals to enact their dominion over all living being beneath their united facade . And dissidents would give themselves away simply by thinking against the system . Such dissidents were taken from their homes and taken to re-education centres , where a combination of M ' yen hypnosis techniques and powerful chemical olfactory were employed to re-align the loyalties of the discordant elements . They returned to their home worlds speaking of the beautiful verdant lands they had visited , and how they had spoke personally to Aun ' Va , who told them the true meaning of the greater good . So far , not one of the re-educated citizens of the Empire has ever been known to re-offend . Such is the destiny of unity . On the western borders of the Tau Meta-Empire , things are rather different , throughout this period . Growing mobilisation on the eastern borders meant the Tau could not afford to supply these colonies and distant Septs with the latest technology and weaponry . On some worlds , they were even still using old devilfish chassis and gunship variants , as well as the old battlesuit designs . These colonies shared greater trading and cross-cultural exchange with outside societies than the very insular inner colonies of the Empire . Numerous human Imperiums and civilisations trading ideas and technology with these colonies , or , more often , would raid or make war upon these weaker Tau societies , thinking they were unable to defend themselves . Sometimes this was accurate ; most of the time it was not . Many were the foolish brigand-captains who , clad in their stolen finery and armed with pillaged vessels , who try to blast the Tau into submission . Their rail guns and Hero-class cruisers often demonstrated with defiant clarity just who was the real power in the area . The semi-independent Enclave known as the Farsighted Enclave , is a rare example of a truly independent Tau civilisation , completely distinct from their authoritarian neighbours . It is a bizarre feudal culture centred around archaic battlesuit-wearing Kasar-princes , who maintain personal armies and vie with one another for influence . There 's is a bastard culture of many different origins , which can only really unite when under threat by a faction more powerful than all of the princes combined . Such a foe reared its head in 222 . M53 . In this year , the outer waystations of the Enclave picked up the distinctive signature of a large battlefleet entering realspace from the warp . Accordingly , Kais ' Kasar ' Koilgu , the local Kasar-prince , gathered his forces and his battlefleet and thundered to intercept this fleet . Over the moon of Jubza , the two fleets met . The enemy fleet did n't even attempt to communicate with Koilgu . Instead , the vast fleet of boxy , bulky vessels , each distinctive and colourful in its livery and decoration , opened fire upon Koilgu's armada . The battle raged for days , until the flagship of the mysterious fleet fired boarding torpedoes directly into Koilgu's own command vessel . The Enclave Tau fought hard with pulse rifle and bloody-minded determination , but they were easily cut down by the arrogant giants who rampaged through the ship , accompanied by flocks of adoring human worshippers who fired lasguns and cried prayers to their masters . Eventually , the leader of the foe burst onto Koilgu's bridge . Koilgu was armoured in a beautifully maintained battlesuit , covered in honour markings and inscriptions of glory . Before him , God-Captain Flaegren , Astartes-Under Lord for the seventeenth crusade of Grand Sicarium stood in ornate power armour with glittering power fist , his shoulders swathed in a thick lion pelt , his head covered by ostentatious jewellery of the most garish kind . The two opulent and corrupt figures stared each other down for but an instant before the charged . Bolter and melta raged against plasma rifle and burst cannon , crackling power fist clattered against a sparking Mechanicus power glaive , granted to Koilgu by a captured Adept long ago . Though the battlesuit made Koilgu fiendishly strong , Flaegren was a veteran of almost a millennia of bloodshed and warfare . His skill was phenomenal , and the duel ended which the psychotic marine carving opn Koilgu's chassis , before having his sycophantic minions pour molten gold inside the suit with the screaming Tau still inside . Koilgu's gilded corpse was delivered to the Grand Kassar of the Enclave scant months later . The retainer who brought the grizly trophy to the Kassar arrogantly recited the God-Captain's message . "" Here is a valuable gift to the great Kassar of the Farsighted Enclave . A token of the benevolence of Lord King Sicarius and the Grand Sicarium . You shall receive more of these mighty gifts , should your foolish peoples choose to oppose the dominion of the true master of the Galaxy , and the King of all Astartes ! "" Needless to say , but the remains of the retainer , after the Kassar was done with him , would have barely filled a small paper cup . The challenge of Flaegren had bee accepted , and it would be many years before his crusade could be stopped by the Enclave . Over a dozen worlds and a hundred battlefronts , the insane Marines of Grand Sicarium and their men at arms fought bitter world to world wars with the Enclaves . Each side fought like smoke , fluidly attempting to out manoeuvre their opponents before delivering a killing blow . Guerilla campaigns were launched by desperate or hate-fuelled enclavers , and the Astartes responded with vast bombing runs over civilian population centres . The sheer number and variety of conflicts that raged for decades throughout the lawless border regions could fill a library themselves , but eventually both sides were exhausted , numbers dwindling to but a fraction of their previous forces . Bitter and driven by a blinding arrogance , Flaegren continued his campaign , initiating a blistering and penetrative offensive with his remaining fleet , which plunged like a spear deep into the soft tissue of the farsighted Enclave . The capital world itself was besieged by two great battlebarges . These massive floating cityscapes were almost impossible to destroy ; time and again dedicated bands of battlesuits and drones would sally forth on covert missions to infiltrate and destroy the colossi , but to no avail . Then , something truly disastrous occurred . In his hubris and mania , Flaegren had neglected to maintain his stocks of ordnance throughout the war . His logistical lines were stretched to breaking point , and this breaking point came sixteen months into the final siege . A vast Astartes supply vessel , the bride of Sicarius , burst into the system without escort , hoping to resupply the vast barges who had been constantly pounding any large cities or settlements they could find upon the surface . Before it could reach Flaegren's vessels however , the Kassar's men finally leapt into action . Over seven hundred battlesuits , three hundred orcas filled with loyal fire warriors , supported by a tribe of the mercenary Kroot , boarded the vessel , and destroyed all the munitions in a great storm of gunfire and screams . Now helpless and unarmed , the battle-barges were easy meat for the reinforcements that came to wreak their terrible vengeance upon the hated Astartes . Kasar-princes from across the Enclave burst into the system with their attendant fleets , spewing glistening arcs of blue and purple energy into the stricken behemoths . Missiles and ion batteries of a dozen different configurations and designs pumped their destructive force into breaking apart the ancient Terran constructs . Armour plates splintered and blistered , men and women howled as the void reached in to snatch away their lives in a fiery instant , and slowly but surely , both the great ships collapsed under the pressure , tumbling into pieces like the decomposing corpses of whales . It was said Flaegren went down with his ship , insanely ordering his men to stop dying , as the air was sucked from the bridge . He died hacking apart his own minions as they treasonously asphyxiated on the floor at his gilded boots . This is , of course , but a brief glimpse into the actions of the Tau of this period , as destiny called out to all races in the wake of building giants in both the void and the warp . Soon enough , the Tau , the young race turned into a cynical monstrosity by grief , were forced to reassess their place in the galaxy , and to choose a side in the final great and enduring conflict of our ( and indeed all ) times . For it was coming , and no dynasty would be secure from it in the end . Additional Background Information 3 : The Asur Revenant : The actions of the Eldar . It would be remiss of this history to ignore one of the prime movers throughout the Eternal War . By the close of the second Age of Strife , to an outside observer , the Eldar race would have seemed utterly extinct , save for those last few burning embers . Indeed , most of the vast Craftworlds were naught but ghost ships , rumbling silently with the souls of the countless dead Eldar slain in the hopeless task of awakening their god of the Dead , while others were victims of the great Chaos Empires and Necron uprisings in the ascent throughout that darkest of times . Of the Craftworlders , only Biel-Tan remained active and defiant , attracting those few outsiders and rogues of their race to them , and forging a moderate empire of hundreds of worlds ( though these remained scattered across the galaxy , thus making their empire seem impossibly diffuse and hard to notice ) . Yet , this is but a fragment of the Eldar race in total . For , running through the veins of the webway like black Tar was a realm which had never stopped , and never repented of their actions . Commorragh . The Second Age of Strife had a different name in the Dark City of Sin . It had been considered a golden age . With the fall of the Imperium , all order vanished and collapsed . Once secure worlds across the galaxy were now helpless before the Dark Kin and their ever-draining souls . Worlds were repeatedly ravaged by the Dark Eldar Kabals . Slaves souls and tortured screams filled the City in a great tumult . Yet , for all their building prosperity , the drain upon their own gangrenous souls grew too . Their raids were ever more frequent as the coiling embrace of slannesh tightened as her power built in the anarchy of the wider galaxy . The Dark Eldar continued on as they had always done , driven by insanity and malice and utter evil . They continued to conspire against one another and the dark pits were ever-filled with the shrieks of the damned and the dying . And at the centre of this all , was Vect . The Overlord of Commorragh , however , was truly mad . One of the eldest beings alive , the Dark Lord's life drew on long beyond his ability to rejuvenate his soul ; millions upon millions of slaves and minions had to perish every day to keep his soul from being drained away like bile in rainwater . He grew desperate and ever-more dangerous as his mind began to slip from him . To begin with , this mania was merely a deception ; a lure to draw out conspirators against his position . But after thousands of years , deception became truth , and Asbruael Vect became something far worse than a monster and a Tyrant to the dark Eldar ; he became a liability and a threat to all Archons . Kabals who did n't bring back sufficient souls were destroyed as they entered the Port of Lost Souls , and their ruins were picked over by the parched and rival Archons alike . His punishments for perceived slights and threats against him were brutal even by his own standards . Some Archons were carved up into a thousand parts , re-grown through the oceans of agony generated by the Haemonculi , and each one was then butchered and tortured , before being deposited upon Slanneshi daemonworlds . Yet , there was but one Archon who could hope to challenge Vect's entrenched position . Lady Malys . Disgruntled Kabals flocked to her banner secretly , and the old Noble houses slithered to her throne with tributes of the caged screams of billions of wailing infants and the hearts of an entire race made extinct in her name . And it was not just they who had her ear . The Harlequins , it was rumoured , came secretly to her chambers , and danced the secret dances that nobody knew . Secrets and prophesies and words uttered only once and never uttered in all the countless eons of existence before or since . ( The rumours of bladed shadows that descended upon worlds assailed by the Nightbringer's forces during the eastern campaigns are perhaps not so far-fetched as once believed ... but this is another story ... ) Yet the Dark Lord was not without his own allies ; his sycophants and those Eldar who truly wished to see the world sicken and misery to reign , simply to see what would happen , and how it could be rebuilt in a vile manner of their own choosing . At every level of the twisted Hierarchies of Commorragh , a new division was brewing , amidst the various and multifaceted feuds and ambition which was normal and encouraged across the twisted realm . Of course , to the outside galaxy , this was an unseen war , but it was not unfelt . The Dark Eldar were being bred on an unprecedented scale , and the Haemonculi rejoiced as they could breed more eventual fodder for their labs . Abominations were released on millions of worlds across the galaxy , and no one could comprehend what these misshapen things were , or why they so desperately tortured , raped and destroyed them . Raids became even more frequent , as the raw material that formed Commorragh's bedrock was in ever greater demand . While ambition brewed in the dark city , the rest of the Eldar race was not idle . Biel-Tan engaged in a war against the Eastern Chaos Imperium . The realm of renegades and brigands was vast , bordering both Vulkan's new Imperium and the western domains of Abaddon himself . Yet , it was a cumbersome beast , with little order beyond the great fleets of Huron Blackheart , the rotting heart of the Chaos Imperium . The war was predominantly a naval conflict , as the Eldar made up for their lack of numbers by using Waystones and spirit gems to guide and control the massive numbers of orphaned craftworld fleets , greatly bolstering the numbers available to Yriel . Yriel was a genius in void warfare , yet Huron , despite his age and his increasing chaotic taint , was also a master of fleets . There were far too many naval actions , spread across centuries upon centuries , to document in their entirety here . For Yriel was a persistent threat and nuisance to Huron . His ships were arrow-swift and they only fought battles when they had no other choice . Most of the time , they avoided his great Corsair armadas . When they did strike , it was while Huron's armies were occupied in other wars against lesser Imperiums and against Abaddon and his Legions or the Astartes Commanderies of Vulkan . Whenever Huron was weakest , Yriel struck . It is testament to the skill of Huron and his Lieutenants that these battles were rarely one-sided ; they always knew of some means to reply to the Eldar . Indeed , Huron's familiar whispered of coming threats weeks before they arrived . One such battle was in the system of Maniforge , where Yriel came close to being destroyed . The world was a Dark Mechanicus forge world ; a world infested with the Obliterator plague right to its very core . Huron's vessels , limping back to an allied port after a failed campaign against the Lead Bastion , one of Grand Sicarium's core worlds , were attacked by Yriel's hidden Void Stalkers , cruisers and wraithships as they burst into reality . Like daggers through silk , the Eldar engaged the chaotic vessels , laying waste to hundreds of vessels within hours . But Huron had picked the Maniforge for a very particular reason . He had made a pact with the Deep Entity known as Valchocht the Maker , the Ravager of Terra , Lord of the Obliterator contagion . These great Daemon was promised all of maniforge , as well as the sanctified sacrifices of two hundred betrayed Red Corsairs . But what really sealed the pact was the promise of bright Eldar souls to devour . Eldar were so very rare , and it would please Valchocht to deny the young upstart God Slannesh some of her prize delicacies . When Yriel destroyed the first wave of chaos vessels , he sealed the deal , and maniforge opened . Valchocht and his ilk were daemons from the deep warp ; ancient and vast beyond all imagining . When he was reborn upon the plane of flesh , he bodily possessed all of the wrecked hulks at once . Vine sof sulphurous daemonflesh and churning technologies flowed between the ruins , knitting them together into an behemoth as vast as a star fort . Huron eventually arrived hours later , and the battle of Maniforge began anew . Both sides were heavily battered and brutalised and not one vessel escaped unscathed . Yriel's flagship was almost consumed by a great destroyer-wide maw which burst from Valchocht's stolen flesh of steel and souls , but skilful piloting and the spear of twilight spared him of this end . Another engagement in the long war led the two enemies to almost be destroyed by a third force , when they became becalmed in the dead warp around the Angylworld of Zone . Their engines failed and their crews became sluggish and weak , as the cold influence of the perfectly symmetrical world of order and obedience spread out from it like a vile halo . Luckily , they managed to repair their vessels just as their sensors picked up the great silver pinions of the Angyls of the Star Father , come to break their spirit and enslave their minds . Biel-Tan would never bow . The hollow tombworlds that were once the craftworlds echoed with the sounds of skirmishing and violence . Bands of looters and pirates attempted to ransack these ancient worldships for their hidden technologies and the secrets that lay within them . They often learned too late that the capering ones in their cloaks of many colours still defended their kins' graves . And yet , Craftworld after Craftworld was pillaged by some great force , which could evade the defenders easily . They did not cause damage though , and they only took one thing . Each craftworld found their Avatars spirited away . Only gory offerings and broken spirit stones marked their passing . When the war of Commorragh finally came , there was carnage ( which will be detailed further in later parts ) . Yet , soon , the two rivals found that a far greater war had come to the galaxy , and for once , they could not hide from it , for it came for them . The full extent of this war will become apparent in later sections , but the Dark Eldar experienced their first real taste of this conflict when the great Jackal God began in earnest , his war upon the webway . Though the deceiver had little power there , the greater war had begun to awaken his more ... esoteric allies from their slumber / imprisonment / banishment . The Ophilim Kiasoz , that great unknowable terror , had dimensions that bisected the webway in certain sections . What is more , it had allies amongst the Dark Eldar themselves ; creatures that had bonded themselves to the anomaly through some means mortals were not meant to know . The dark Kin would fight in the war for existence , in the inky blackness of the Mandrake's trap , or they too would perish . And of course , all true Eldar grew to fear and despise those who rose from the Crone worlds , led by that mongrel fend , whose name was twice-antagonist ; Ysgar Oppugnant . Those eldar who were favourites of the Deepest Warp , brought back to drink deep of the fall of flesh and the ascent of excess . The Chaos Eldar , who would attempt to bring the galaxy to its knees , at the head of the impossible Draziin-Maton , whom gathered for the End . Additional Background Information 4 : The Blind Eagle ; The Empire of the Theologian Union . At the close of the Second Age of Dusk , the very heart of the Ophelian Imperium was suddenly and violently ripped out by the sudden and thunderous birth of the Star Father . The entire world was dragged into the warp and becalmed by legions of Angyls . It became the Angylworld of the ArchAngyl Malcador , and reappeared as a world of thoughtless drones deep within the Storm of the Emperor's Wrath , many thousands of light years removed from its former location . This loss was a near fatal blow to the Ophelian Imperium . In one fell swoop , over half the Sisters Thanatine ( the Elite monastic Military Order which formed the elite core of the petty Imperium's colonial forces ) , as well as the Ecclesiarch and most of the Cardinals versed in Saint Karamazov the Martyred's Doctrines of the faith , enforced as the official faith in the manic realm . The Imperium's precarious administrative organisation was compromised and rendered inoperative . Within ten years of M51 , the Ophelian Imperium had descended into anarchy , as the Governor-Kings of the thousand-strong Empire fought and bickered in bitter conflicts of succession between each other , sometimes besieging their own fellow Imperial worlds with their PIFs ( Planetary Invasion Forces ) and what ships they could spare . Though trade continued betwixt the realms , it was carried out with paranoid wariness ; much revenue being expended on simply defending cargo fleets from attack during their long short-warp jump journeys between the strongholds of each individualistic despot . Some Governor's were utterly unscrupulous , hiring outside human and alien mercenaries ( even Krieg Serf soldiers ) to overcome their rivals , often entering into surprisingly disadvantageous alliances in order to assert their claim Capital-status for their own world , and desperately each tried to get their own candidates elected by the Cardinals to become Eccliesiarch . This of course meant that the Ophelian Imperium was much weakened at this time , and many of the border worlds were sacked by opportunistic enemies , such as the carnivorous amphibious Cythenan empire , and the Vazineren Imperium , with its cadres of Psychons , terrible soldiers recruited solely from the mounting Psyker population of that particular Imperium ( which was formed around an unstable warp rift known as the Kazid ) . It was at this point , after years of anarchy , that the Tallern Imperium really began to take an increased interest in their troublesome neighbour . While the Ophelians had been laid low by the events of the Age of Strife , the Tallarn Emperors and their Nobles ruling over their many thousands of worlds managed to endure the terrors which destroyed many of their weaker neighbours . Through a combination of cunning and logistical might , they fought off hundreds of major invasions during the first century of the Age of Dusk . The rise of the Vulkan Imperium was fortunately timed , its expansion drawing their hateful eyes of many of the worst and most powerful nations and races of the galaxy , including the Twin behemoths of the Eastern and western Chaos imperiums . Thus , they were in a strong position to take advantage of the Ophelian Imperium , orphaned of its former Capital . It began under Emperor al-Fonze Ma ' karib II of Tallarn , in 132 . M52 , during his campaigns of reconstruction in the northern fringes of the Ophelian Imperium . He besieged and took these worlds forcibly , but was incredibly merciful in his treatment of these worlds after their defeat . He permitted the terrified Lords of the Hive cities to buy their passage of retreat from the worlds , and he did not install massive colonisation forces on the captured worlds , but instead sent preachers and supplies to help rebuild the smashed and in some cases starving populations of these worlds . Forced conversion was kept to a bare minimum . Yet , al-Fonze's assassination by one of the mysterious ' Heracles' Faction of ex-Temple assassins meant his campaigns were halted after only seven years . Nevertheless , the impression was made upon the Ophelian population ( at least in the outer worlds ) . In the 160s of M52 , the Governors of the outlying Ophelian worlds began to cooperate to a greater degree against the old guard of the Inner worlds , who still looked inwards in despair of their lost capital world . They looked to the Tallarns to aid them in this task . They offered the Tallarn ruling aristocrats trading privileges and even lands and estates upon their worlds , in exchange with funding and weapons in order to face the inner worlds , who maintained most of the Ophelian Imperium's manufacturing worlds and subordinate Forge Worlds . The many fleet engagements , pitched planetary sieges and raids that ensued could fill a dozen history books themselves , but in the end , the core worlds were driven into a corner and forced to sue for a truce . The Thrarantine Guard ( who had expanded to a massive size during this period , as they were seen as the most Theologically ' pure ' force in the secular conflict ) arbitrated the terms of the treaties , and their was a semblance of peace . Nevertheless , the Tallarn were now intrinsically involved in the diffuse and fractious politics of the Ophelians . Over the centuries , the two Imperiums began to merge , via dense trading corridors that ( though they took many years to traverse ) provide wealth and prosperity to the rulers and their magnates . At the council of Thezibebe , hundreds of Tallarn-orthodox , Ophelian Kazamarovite and Ascensionist Cardinals gathered to discuss the election of a new Ecclesiarch to once more unite the faith of the ' true ' Imperium . The debate was not a success , and had to be called off after many of the lesser radical sects tried to set fire to the debate podiums , and the Ascensionists caused a planet-wide riot in which four hundred thousand acres of industrial sprawl became a mangled warzone as vast hordes of zealots and fanatics battled like insane animals in the streets . Between 100 . M53-200 . M53 , it was said that at any one time , five Ecclesiarches and ' anti-Ecclesiarches ' were in place on Pontifical thrones from Tallarn itself to at one point a small mining colony in an unstable star system . Each claimed to be the true Ecclesiarch . Despite this schism amidst the clergy , the worlds themselves became closer , and their cultures began to merge and develop . Fear of the outsider and the xenos began to mutate into a creed of ' Humanism Absolutism ' ; that is , the creed of Human survival at all costs . Humanity must survive , and let everything else be damned . In 487 . M53 , Emperor Santargo III of Tallarn crowned himself ' Lord Protector of the Imperial Mysteries ' . This strategically side-stepped the theological issues of the newborn super-bloc of Imperiums , and allowed him to justify his secular campaigns , and to impose military tithes upon the worlds nominally under his thrall . Though the worlds of this Imperium were still bitter rivals for the most part , Santargo could still launch his huge crusade to expand the realm in 568 . M53 , gathering together a force of diverse colonial troops and mercinaries , held together by the Thrantine Orders , other growing religious warrior fraternities and sororities , and the iron will of the Emperor Santargo himself , who went to war in one of the perishingly-rare Leviathan Moving fortresses . Though he died before even his first crusade could be completed ( due to the monumental distances involved , and the poor quality and pitfalls of Astronomicon-less warp travel ) his sons and grandsons managed , over the next hundred years , to swallow up a dozen other Imperiums that bordered the Ophelian / Tallarn alliance , subsuming them into the great web of commerce and religious violence which codified the realm of ' Imperial Mysteries ' . Also , during this period of expansion and conflict , a centre of commerce built up around the ruins of a former Star Fortress known as Haanab the Ravaged . Here , trade from across the sprawling realm came , and the ruler of the space station was often a key figure in wider decisions on tithes and tax and what could be imported . Santargo XXII had this fortress massively expanded with subsidiary-stations and had asteroids towed into orbit with this expanding colossus of industry and trade . He then declared Haanab the new capital of the realm of Imperial Mysteries and himself its governor ( even though he was on campaign for his entire life , and never once visited the fort himself ) , with little objection from the powerful nobles and Governor-Lords of the Imperium , as it was relatively neutral . It would be a mistake to consider this realm of captured and consumed Imperiums to be a singular super power that that point . It was a huge area of space , covering a huge swathe of the south-west of the galactic plane . Such a realm could not be administered by a government with such slow FTL capable vessels , and for much of the time huge sections of the ' Empire ' were like lawless realms of border princes and robbing Wolf Packs of bandits , and squabbling Governor-Lords vying for advantage or pressing assumed claims of heritage . Amidst this anarchy and misery , there was the undercurrent of a building popular faith . The Emperor of the wasteland . There were no longer any survivors from the time before the Second Age of Strife , and no man had ever seen or heard of the Emperor's actions beyond vague recollections of priestly chroniclers , who had hastily scribbled down scripture from memory after the loss of all the written records of the Ministorum upon Ophelia . Thus , the image of the Emperor became horribly distorted . The vile concept of the Corpse-Emperor merged with the creed of human survival at all costs , turning the Emperor into some legendary undead figure of vengeance and pragmatic , who ruled a universe of broken worlds and failed systems , yet refused to relinquish them , like a jealous child . This creed was paradoxically both horribly cynical yet fervent in its prosecution and practices . A faith of nihilistic mania , where only suffering and miserable stubbornness could get one closer to your god . So what if his empire was of ashes and ruins ? It was still HIS . His ashes . His ruins . When a necrotic warp plague ravaged the allied Imperiums in M54 , the tenuous hold of the Tallarn Emperor's was undone , and a power vacuum was soon created with their failure . The Cardinal known as Ceylan was to be the very man to fill this void . His name would grow to be one whispered in awe and utter terror by his subjects . This cardinal began his life as a mere clerk in one of the priestly houses of sanctioned invention , where he made friends easily and swiftly , due to his serpent's tongue and charming demeanour . All of which hid his great pathological personality and truly evil ambition . Through a series of coincidences and sinister ploys , he manipulated his way into the priesthood , worming his way right into the meat of the Ecclesiarchy like a maggot in meat . He used his power and influence to place his friends into powerful offices and in particular patronised the work of his questionable-disciple Deng-Vaal . This man claimed to be a warp scientist , and made a major breakthrough in the method of warp travel . He found if one could torture psykers and witches sufficiently , and somehow captured and stored their torment and lingering death-screams , one could power a ship through the warp at tremendous speed . Ceylan quickly seized upon this idea , taking it as his own and tying it into the natural distrust for psykers prevalent in the realm . He turned this process into a form of benevolent penance ; the death of the psyker would purify both their soul , but also allow the Emperor's children to spread to the very furthest reaches of space . He managed to acquire Secular support from a number of prominent Tallarn old-born Noble houses , as well as the favour of some of the radical factions who desired to build a stronger Empire , under a powerful leader . As reward for his discovery , Ceylan was granted the position of Ecclesiarch by his fellow Cardinals . His exact theological leanings were always slightly in question , but the devious man could never be pinned down to a single definitive answer , and thus was elevated to the post without noticeable opposition . For the first time in a long time , there was only one Ecclesiarch of this Imperium . As the ' Excruciator ' Engines were being created and tested by the forge worlds under Vaal's watchful gaze , Ceylan subtly and smoothly began to undermine the central faiths of the Cardinals , playing them off against each other , but avoided any responsibility himself by claiming he was merely arbitrating between wronged parties . As he sowed discord there , he discreetly promoted the more popular faith of the Emperor of the wasteland . He stealthily inserted known rhetoric used by the Creed in his sermons and speeches . Just as the faith of the Imperium was becoming unified in religious wars and reform , the means to propagate this faith across the entire Imperium was finally completed and made widespread use of . His influence grew as the Imperium consolidated itself via the new cruel means of breaching the warp . Eventually , with this greater unity there came a chance for a new Emperor to take over . Naturally , Ceylan manipulated the processes of selection and influence , until a candidate of his preference was selected . Ceylon made sure never to publically claim leadership or secular power over the Imperium , but rather worked behind the scenes . The Tharantine and his own spy network , known unofficially as the Aquila-men , discreetly carried out his orders and kept the various other armies and factions within the Empire under control . As a final demonstration of the new focus of human unity of purpose , the Emperor renamed the Empire the Theologian Union . By M55 , the Theologian Union was the third largest human Imperium in the galaxy , able to hold its own in campaigns against the very largest of empires . Initially , the Union struggled to maintain a strong focus , for the source of direct outside enemies to attack were few . They were engaged with semi-persistent wars with Pirate nations , Hybrid Cults of strange aliens with bulging heads and snapping claws . And a large scale siege of the world of Rokfal , where the race of feral greenskins had made a sudden and unheralded resurgence , smashing the industry of the planet almost annually , as the force of barbarians continually threw itself against its attackers with mindless vigour , getting stronger every time , as if feeding upon warfare itself for nourishment . However , Ecclesiarch Ceylan the first Found the perfect foe when Vulkan sent his envoys to the Theologian Union , bearing banners of compromise and hope . When the envoys refused to show fealty to the Ecclesiarch ( the Emperor's representative ) , the Emperor cast the ambassadors out . Ceylan began to order the preachers of the Union to spread themselves amongst the people , and spread the word . There was no Primarch upon Armaggedon . There could n't be . They were dead . This ' Vulkan ' was a daemon disguised as a primarch , they claimed . And so it was that the blind men of the deluded realm of the Wasteland Emperor turned their hand ever against their own kind . In their own way , these vainglorious zealots brought upon themselves the terrible events that marked the Dusk of all things , in the final war of conclusion and defiance . Additional Background Information 5 : The War-race Tempered : The Ork Risen . In the opening years of the Second Age of Strife , the orks as a race battled their nemesis , the New Devourer , and in doing so were destroyed in that titanic struggled which raged across hundreds of sectors . Though they had not been aware of it , their actions had inadvertently saved the entire galaxy from the New Devourer . While their war had been futile , it had delayed the hybrid Tyranid-Ork menace , which eventually found itself drawn away to fight some unseen foe beyond the galaxy . In the midst of the horrors of the strife age , people dared to hope that perhaps the orks themselves were made extinct in this great conflagration . The audacity of hope is so easily quashed , for the Orks yet lived . Minute spores and fungal helixes were left behind on the millions of abandoned greenskin worlds . However , it would take many thousands of years before the spores could fully recover , and spread like a bacterial plague through the undergrowth and organic matter which flourished on their former worlds . One such planet was the world of Lexin Fidorich . The humans there had come from the nearby Feudal Technocracy known as Shunter-beerne , who had eagerly captured this nearby world , which was impossible fecund and fertile . By M52 , Lexin was a flourishing world of diverse environments made tame by the sterile crop-scienc eof the cybernetic humans who tended this veritable garden . However , soon the Feudal Hyper-lords of the Shunter-beerne found their woods and forests infested with strange red beasts with ugly tusks and a belligerent attitude . This was intolerable , and long-limbed game keeper constructs cleansed the biomes of these beasts with gunshot and flame . This was a mistake . Smaller green creatures began to appear in the woods . They watched and scurried through the woods . Occasionally they would steal children or set fires , and stole massive quantities of metal sheeting and cut down sections of woods . Again , the long-striding machines killed most of them ; but not all . Those who were birthed afterwards filled in for their fallen , and the building of crude settlements began . Within the space of a decade , Feral monstrous warbands were roaming across the planet . Tranquil glass cities were smashed by the tread of hundreds of vast squiggoth beasts , and the crude firearms of their riders . Throughout the now-infested woods , an ancient cry not heard in millennia rang out ; waaaaaagh ! More and more powerful constructs were deployed on the surfaceby the Shunters , with ever deadlier weapons , but this only speeded the advance of their foes . Soon they had to abandon their planet . They did not possess exterminates grade weaponry however , and thus they could not prevent the Feral ork spread . This story reoccurred on dozens of sectors and systems across the galaxy , followed by hundreds upon hundreds after that . In particular feral orks tended to thrive just on the cusp of the various inter-power struggles which were ongoing across the galaxy ; there were veritable masses of feral orks on the border with Grand Sicarium and the Kassars , as well as the unruly space between the Thexians and the Tau , and on the fringes of Maelstrom space . One of the Demiurge brotherhoods ( The collective of Hashut ) even began to enslave feral ork bands for use in their schism against their rival Brotherhoods . As the shattered galaxy had no singular authority to recognise this building force , every lesser faction assumed these were localised threats and barely contained them . However , these feral bands of barbarians were naught but the wisps of powdered snow before an avalanche . At the close of the 52nd Millennium , there were signs across the galaxy . Feral orks were driven into fits of prophetic madness , and weirdboys chanted and babbled insanely . Something churned up the warp , and the powers realigned , for they could sense what was coming back . The Orks were returning . But not simply orks ... It began on the planet of Galgoroth , a rich mining world which had the protection of a coalition of minor xenos and human enclaves . The year was 999 . M52 , and the world reported fearsome warpstorms ; the biggest seen since their records had begun ( in practice , their records had n't begun until M50 , during its founding ) . It was then that they detected that a space hulk had translated into the system , a Hulk known as St. Jollepur's Bane . Their Managing Governor-Director was not pleased . Hulks were dens where minor xenos ( perhaps even an isolated gang or feral orks had managed to survive in the warp upon the hulk ? ) and pirates infested the hideous amalgams of vessels and asteroids . He had experienced hulk-drift while on another core-wards world centuries before , and he disliked what they promised . The world's PDF and system ships would have to be diverted from guarding his planet from real threats , to mop up the degenerate scum that would surely be squatting within its haunted depths . So , reluctantly , he unleashed his large fleet to engage the hulk on its brief incursion into his planet's local area . His fleet was composed of old mass produced Tau cruisers re-fitted for human use , Vulkanian vessels traded with the rising human power , and even some antique Mars Cruisers were amongst this diverse and lethal armada . On board the transport vessels , Krieg Serf Soldiers , Kroot and Fremen were hired on Galgoroth's ruling Corporation's expense , alongside a Free Company of Obsidian Falcon Astartes and as much of the local PDF forces he could afford to send in support . Eventually , the fleet reached the hulk . Initial scans and intel gathered by the fleet showed that the hulk was like nothing they had ever seen before . The hulk was no longer merely a mass of weaponised ruins drifting through space ; it was a warship . Uniform , sturdy armour covered its colossal flanks , alongside thousands of rows of vast weapon batteries and gun emplacements . And jutting from its shark-like sides were great spurs and towers , from which it seemed an entire fleet was at dock . That was when the firing started , and communication was lost with Galgoroth . The skies were aflame as the battle raged for almost three days . Ships were blown apart , or pulled open by tractor beams and high explosive ordnance , as well as more arcane and strange weaponry deployed by the new foe . Enemy soldiers were teleported directly into enemy vessels , and proceeded to massacre everyone with extreme efficiency , barely a sonorous growl escaping the butchers' lips as they killed . Only a handful of vessels returned to the mining world , including the utterly-mauled Strike Cruiser of the Obsidian Falcons . Their leader , Captain Eregious , immediately deployed one of his squads to the surface of Galgoroth . The Governor demanded to know what was attacking them . Was it xenos ? Pirates ? Enemy Marines ? Orks ? Eregious responded with a simple phrase . "" Those are not Orks ... "" His squad attacked and broke into the treasure vaults of the world , securing their payment before deploying back to their Cruiser . Eregious refused to stay and defend the world , because he wished to preserve his brothers . For the foe arrayed before them was too powerful and too numerous to defeat ; not with such depleted resources . So , the Galgorothans waited and fortified their planet as the bulky , well-constructed warships of the enemy hurtled towards them . The Kill Cruisers and huge battleships of the enemy easily swatted away the System Defence Ships , and deployed their ground forces after a bombardment of all the centres of military resistance . City-scale factories were dropped directly upon the planet , and began to work as soon as they slammed to the ground with a thunderous rumble that resounded across the mountains themselves . The few pockets of resistance remaining were dealt with by hulking armoured figures that deployed right at the heart of their battlelines , stepping through warp portals with ease . They wielded weapons like bolters , but far more destructive , alongside strange weapons , such as a device which teleported not gretchin , but miniature plasma warheads inside the bodies of their opponents . After barely two days , the planet was conquered , and those humans not slain in the bombardments were rounded up and used as slave labour in the mining districts , which were expanded and enhanced by the mysterious foe , who deployed huge titan-scale excavators and walking machines to heft out vast quantities of raw material for the hundreds of factories deployed by the orbital fiends . This was the galaxy's first taste of the new greenskin race . Ten Hulks at least were reported with similar modifications , but that first hulk remained the largest of this new phenomenon . These creatures did not call themselves the orks , but rather merely called themselves ' War ' , or at most ' the War of the Krork ' . Few people have subsequently breached the armoured hides of the War-Hulks , but it is claimed that the Krorks are in fact the commanders and driving force behind this new breed of elite Ork . It is theorised that these new creatures are in fact modified gretchin or grots , altered to be tacticians and schemers beyond the ken of the larger breeds ; it has to be noted that no smaller greenskins have been sighted within the battle-hosts of ' the War ' . Who manipulated them or remade these intelligent creatures remained unknown for many millennia , during the age of intertwining fates , but we shall get to that in due course ... The warriors of the Krork were a distillation and perfection of previous ork concepts and natural abilities . Each warrior wore flexible powered armour , which captured the spores released by them and sealed them in flame-proof canister inside the suits . These canisters were collected after a battle , and were taken to their manufacturing shops or their hulks , and dozens more generations of orks were thus spawned , or the spores were carefully cultured and spread upon worlds deemed perfect for Ork-forming . The powered armour also further enhanced each ork's strength , and was flexible enough to expand as the ork expanded . Each soldier ork was first forced to fight against hundreds of its peers inside the war-hulks , and this swelled each beast to vast scales . Most were taller than even an Astartes warrior when they were finally allowed to construct their armour and weaponry , which each and every ork instinctive knew how to build , unconsciously building their gear according to the exact specifications of higher authority , tailoring their weaponry to be optimised for whatever battlefield they found themselves on . Though the unseen ' brainboys ' of the numerous hosts were never seen on the battlefield , powerful War-bosses led the armies of each Hulk , and were brilliant tacticians , as their size naturally made them more intelligent , each war making them more efficient and more intelligent . Each Hulk , though separated by lightyears , had some means of psychic communication with their fellow Hulks , due to either the psychic might of the brainboys , or their manipulation of psyker Orks placed upon modified warp-reading thrones as a form of telepathic network . Needless to say , these Krork hosts spread quickly , and created numerous huge empires . The thirsting Bloodknights of Baal were fought to a standstill around the Juerellian warp gate by the Krork , denied their prise of a whole world of mortals which they could taint and then drain to stave off the black rage . A task force comprising of two whole Commanderies had to be deployed to drive off an Armada of Krork who had managed to cripple the logistical supplies of dozens of Vulkan's systems . That war was known as the war of renewed vengeance , and eventually the forces of Vulkan ( only after the sacrifice of the legendary hero Lord Captain Hexatrin of the Silent Panthers Commandery ) prevailed , but the Krork could not be finally defeated , as they divided their fleet and began a guerrilla campaign which lasted for five hundred years . Numerous battles and wars were found against krorks across the Western and Eastern Chaos Imperiums , and both factions lost dozens of worlds to the disciplined invaders . Abaddon managed to defeat a Krork force by utilising the planet-killer's awesome firepower to destroy a war-hulk , which seemed to be the only method of permanently crippling a Krork Armada . The Krork had special hatred for their feral ork brethren surprisingly , and often accelerated asteroids into planets with them on , or made a special effort to exterminate the entire population of feral greenskins on the ground , before burning the mountains of corpses . The Krork were a menace to all factions , for they seemed to have declared themselves to be a war against all elements of the galaxy . From the Star Father's dread Angyl-worlds , to the blasted ruins of the Shatter-wake and their bone-feeders , the Krork were fearsome opponents . In particular , they seemed to lose some of their cold demeanour when fighting the necrons . On some instinctual level , they just knew what their eldritch function was , for it was encoded into every fibre of their green , war-forged flesh . It was not until the infamous Alliance of the Fringe , that even the notion of concordance with other children of this galaxy occured to them . Their faith was unknown . All that the world at large could decipher of their brutal , complex language spoke of ' awaiting the two , the facets of the god-mount ' . Some claimed , in those early years , that they were merely referring to their primitive ancestor gods , Gork and Mork . Alas , if only it had been that simple . The true relevance of their creed would not become evident until it was too late to stop what had been started . But that conflict shall be documented in a later section , once these chronicles have been properly reinforced to withstand the telling of the tale of the Nex - [ FILE CORRUPTED .

1596	"Procedures Are Pertinent Understanding types of repair information offered by OEMs , and where to find them , improves your repair plans for smoother workflow . Andrew Johnson iStock Auto manufacturer information is available for nearly every step of the repair process : disassembly , body and structural work , refinish , and post-repair quality assurance . Repairers must constantly refer to them for every procedure on every car because designs are changing faster than technicians can be trained . There are an estimated 242 vehicle types that will be re-engineered , redesigned , or introduced as brand-new models over the next three years , says Bill Stage , senior director of development for I-CAR . And those changes are driving updates in required methods for panel attachment , welding , equipment , tools , materials and diagnosis . With so much repair information available , reliance on your memory just does n't cut it these days . So habitual reference to OEM resources are critical for quality , accurate and efficient work to be produced at your facility daily . The Problem Failure to refer to OEM processes is a trend that 's surprisingly common throughout the country , Stage says . Some technicians do n't have time to search for the information , some do n't know where to look , some do n't know what types are available , and others simply do n't know the information even exists . Without the information , Stage says technicians tend to make repair decisions based on guesses , past experience or memory . They start cutting , heating , welding and installing components to try to repair things , but they 're not always accurate . Vehicle updates are made so frequently that many of the processes technicians knew of yesterday are no longer relevant today . That results in several common repair mistakes , he says , such as improper methods for heat application , sectioning , bonding , riveting and restraint system installation . That leads to poor efficiency , cycle time , comeback and customer satisfaction numbers , as well as safety and liability issues â problems that will eventually have a negative impact on sales performance . "" Relying on memory to repair the vehicle will no longer guarantee compliance with OEM procedures , "" Stage say . That 's true even for seasoned veterans . "" With the technology utilized in constructing today's vehicles , you can not safely repair them without access to the information . Sometimes , you ca n't repair them at all , "" he says . What You Need There are more than 20 million pages of OEM repair information available to collision repairers , says Dan Espersen , senior product marketing manager of collision for ALLDATA . The issue for many technicians is the time-consuming task of sifting and sorting through the documents . Here are three main areas that your technicians should learn to find quickly and have on hand at all times : 1 . Restraint system updates : Vehicle restraint systems are regularly modified , even within the same model . Without procedural information , technicians are susceptible to making installations that endanger safety systems throughout the car . Douglas Gan , president of Airbag Solutions , points to the Honda FIT as an example . The 2007 and 2008 FIT restraint system used a pre-tensioner in the belt and an anchor on the driver side . In 2009 , Honda altered that to only a pre-tensioner on both the driver and passenger side . 2 . Material identification : Several new types of high-strength materials are present on new model vehicles â such as steels , aluminum , and in the future , carbon fiber . Technicians must identify the type , location , dimensions , hardness , strength and tolerance of every material because they require updated repair methodology . "" You can not continue to apply the same old methods and logic in today's environment , "" Stage says . "" There are just too many types of materials and construction used in every vehicle . "" Consider this 2013 Honda Accord ( pictured left ) . The B-pillar is 1500 MPA ultra-high-strength steel , Stage says . It ca n't be heated in order to maintain its strength . In addition , where the bottom of the B-pillar meets the rocker panel is an area that requires MIG brazing . Without knowing that , technicians would perform a different outdated process that is likely to weaken the component . "" That would change the vehicle's crash test rating , "" Stage says . "" Occupants wo n't be as protected as they should be in a future wreck . "" 3 . Vehicle complexity : Vehicles are not designed solely of one type of material . That means each component of the car can not be repaired the same way . So knowing the type and location of each material used is crucial . Look at this 2013 Dodge Dart ( right ) . The design features six different types of materials â mild steel , high-strength steel , advanced high-strength steel , press-hardened steel , aluminum and plastic â each of which has its own specific required processes . Espersen says material identification and associated repair methods are among the most important pieces of information for technicians to have easy access to today . But that 's not all . Here 's a look at a few other areas that can dramatically vary between vehicle models where updated information is required : â¢ Structural and panel attachment methods , and required tools and materials to perform the process I-CAR CENTRALIZATION : Even with all these resources available , Gan says it can still be a time-consuming task for technicians to dig through websites and find the information they need . They often feel they do n't have time , which sticks technicians in a dilemma between cycle time and supplement issues . "" Shops want to do the right thing , but are finding it difficult to sort through it all , "" Gan says . "" Shops do n't know where to look , have n't got time to look , and need the information immediately . "" He suggests the industry needs a simpler solution that provides shops with direct connections to information that pertains to the repair they 're performing . Fortunately , I-CAR will soon launch a new initiative to ease technicians' searches for information . The organization is developing a centralized database for all published OEM procedures to create easier and affordable access for shops . The structure for the effort has not yet been determined , but Stage says it will make acquisition of OEM processes much more efficient . Obtain Access Even when technicians know they need OEM repair information , Stage says they do n't always know where to look . He suggests a few resources to utilize during your daily routine : â¢ OEM websites : All auto manufacturers host repair information and technical bulletins on their own websites . Some information is free and some is subscription-based . Shops can purchase short or long-term access to fee-based information from the sites . â¢ OEMOnestop.com : Repairers can visit this website and be directed toward information for all auto manufacturers . â¢ Information providers : The three major estimating companies â Audatex , a Solera Company , CCC Information Services Inc. and Mitchell International have all made developments to build OEM procedures into their systems . Stage says they have developed tools that all shops should take advantage of , such as automatic integration of information within estimates . â¢ ALLDATA : ALLDATA is a single entity that compiles both collision and mechanical OEM repair information into a software package . Visit the company's website , alldata.com , for more information . â¢ Airbag Solutions : Airbag Solutions is an online resource that compiles vehicle restraint system information and procedures for all auto manufacturers .

1360	"Tonya and Marvin Morris were pregnant with their fifth child , Sparrow , when they first learned about cord blood banking . Like many expecting parents who bank , they decided to save her cord blood so it might be available for any of their children , should one of them ever need it . Sparrow Morris was born a healthy baby girl in rural Missouri . When she was 2 years old , she was in the garden playing with her siblings , trying to fill a watering can from the family pool . She lost her balance and tumbled in , quickly becoming unconscious under the water . Tonya began CPR until rescue workers arrived at their rural home and transported the little girl to a place where she could be medevaced to the nearest hospital . The emergency crew did n't receive a pulse until they were in the air . The aftermath After being deprived of oxygen for so long , Sparrow's neurologist had little hope that the toddler would come out of her vegetative state . The family told doctors that they had saved Sparrow's cord blood , but were told that cord blood could only help in the case of blood cancers . Sparrow was sent home , unable to sit up , crawl , or talk . Nearly a year later , Tonya was approached by a friend who was interested in banking with CBR . Tonya called CBR and was put through to a Cord Blood Education Specialist . During the call , she happened to ask the Specialist if cord blood was currently being used to treat brain injury . She was transferred immediately to CBR's transplant office . Offering the chance at a better life Thirteen months after the accident , Sparrow received a reinfusion of her cord blood stem cells through an investigational treatment at Duke University . Shortly after , in conjunction with physical and occupational therapies , her family began to report she was moving her limbs with purpose . Today , Sparrow has been released from all of her physical and speech therapy classes . According to her mother , "" Sparrow is doing so well ! Other than continuing to have some balance issues , she can walk , run , and jump on the trampoline . She is meeting goals set out for her and far exceeding what anyone thought she was capable of . She speaks slowly , but is able to string five - to nine-word sentences together . """	Information/Explanation

1415	"Learning the Language of Support In almost every exchange with your student â whether you 're talking , texting , or even IMing â parents have a chance to support and encourage success in the classroom , participation in out-of-class activities , and the ability to get through those inevitable tough times . Badger Parent frequently consults with students , parents , faculty , and staff members for advice on the best ways to "" learn the language "" of support and encouragement so that parents can be effective mentors to their students . To succeed academically , the group agreed , other facets of a student's life â including the transition to college , health , and state of mind â need to be in synch . The key to promoting this kind of wellness is learning as much as you can about how your son or daughter is feeling , while also being open and nonjudgmental . "" My mom is always available when I need someone to listen to me vent , "" says Sarah K. , a current UW â Madison student . "" Talking to her is a way for me to talk out my problems , and she only gives advice if I ask . "" Keep in mind that the support a student needs most may change , depending upon the issue â and sometimes as frequently as day to day . Christopher Lee , an assistant dean in the College of Letters and Science , says that , as a parent , you have an advantage : knowing your student as well as you do provides clues to the real issues . Lee advises that it 's always better to frame the discussion with a question â such as , "" How are you feeling about school ? "" â than to start by asking if something is wrong . Asking open-ended questions , rather than asserting opinions , is another way to approach the conversation , he adds . For example , if your student says , "" I 'm not good at chemistry , "" you could respond with , "" I know you are smart and can do it . Keep trying . "" This response , while supportive , has limitations . It places the student in the position of having to prove that he or she is smart by doing well . Instead , parents can ask , "" What are you having trouble with ? "" This question is more likely to elicit useful information about what is wrong , ranging from problems with math to not attending lectures . When students are given the chance to identify the problems themselves , they are much more likely to attempt to solve them , Lee says . Susan Brantly , professor of Scandinavian Studies and director of the Bradley Learning Community , agrees that it is important to listen and sympathize when your student calls and is homesick or frustrated about something . But , she says , it 's then most helpful to encourage him or her to begin solving the problems independently . For students living in University Housing , house fellows or residence life staff are particularly adept at coaching students to solve problems and redirecting them to the many campus resources . Cathy Middlecamp , distinguished faculty associate in the chemistry department , reminds parents that a student's health can have a major impact on academic performance near the end of the semester . If your student is sending e-mails at 2 a.m. or is sounding particularly worn out during your conversations , remind him or her to pay attention to the basics , such as sleeping enough and eating well , to stay healthy . "" This is about the time of the semester that everyone gets tired and ill , "" she says . "" Signs of exhaustion are frequently followed by illness . Stakes are higher now when [ students ] get sick , in terms of making up lectures or assignments . "" Beyond mental and physical wellness , parents can encourage their student to participate in activities that supplement academic experiences , such as study abroad , undergraduate research , or leadership programs â all of which are components of the Wisconsin Experience , and some of which are unique to UW â Madison . The key is knowing which approach to take . It 's important for students to be successful in the classroom and to be engaged in the Wisconsin Experience . "" Some students may be independent enough to do things on their own , while others may need more encouragement from parents , "" Middlecamp says . Parents who attended First-Year Parents' Weekend in November offered these suggestions for supporting students : Support your student's independence and have confidence in his or her decision-making ability Allow your student to make mistakes Encourage your student to try new things Unconditionally support your student through good grades and bad Share fun things happening with the family back home so your student is still in the loop Let your student know that you love him or her and that you are always there for him or her Offer advice , not directions Call to offer words of encouragement Send postcards , gifts , and food Parents offered this list of things to avoid : Criticizing your student or expecting him or her to fulfill your personal goals Calling too much . Let your child take the lead with correspondence at first and then set up a weekly schedule , if need be . Trying to make decisions for your student Trying to over-manage your student's experience Pressuring your student with unreasonable expectations . Give him or her some time to figure it out . Current Badgers comment on their parents : "" My parents were supportive of me academically ; they encouraged me to get good grades and to find out what I was interested in . They loved me from afar . "" â Hannah K. "" My parents let me call them : if I did n't , it meant I was too busy . They also visited me two to three times during the semester , which was just enough . "" â Mallory S. "" My parents have always been my greatest cheerleaders , instilling within me the strength needed to overcome any challenge . I would call them twice a week freshman year to share any tidbit of my life , be it exciting or stressful , and they were always so excited to listen . "" â Val K."	Instruction

168	"We see with the eyes . But we see with the brain as well . And seeing with the brain is often called imagination . And we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination , our inscapes . We 've lived with them all our lives . But there are also hallucinations as well . And hallucinations are completely different . They do n't seem to be of our creation . They do n't seem to be under our control . They seem to come from the outside , and [ seem ] to mimic perception . So I am going to be talking about hallucinations . And a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients . A few months ago I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work . They told me that one of the residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things . And they wondered if she 'd gone bonkers . Or , because she was an old lady , whether she 'd had a stroke , or whether she had Alzheimer's . And so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie , the old lady . I went in to see her . It was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence . But she 'd been very startled , and very bewildered because she 'd been seeing things . And she told me -- the nurses had n ' t mentioned this -- that she was blind , that she had been completely blind , from macular degeneration , for five years . But now , for the last few days , she 'd been seeing things . So I said , "" What sort of things ? "" And she said , "" People in Eastern dress , in drapes , walking up and down stairs . A man who turns towards me and smiles . But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth . Animals too . I see a white building . It 's snowing , a soft snow . I see this horse , with a harness , dragging the snow away . Then , one night , the scene changes . I see cats and dogs walking towards me . They come to a certain point and then stop . Then it changes again . I see a lot of children . They are walking up and down stairs . They wear bright colors , rose and blue , like Eastern dress . "" Sometimes , she said , before the people come on she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor , which seem to go up to the ceiling . I said , "" Is this like a dream ? "" And she said , "" No , it 's not like a dream . It 's like a movie . "" She said , "" It 's got color . It 's got motion . But it 's completely silent , like a silent movie . "" And she said that it 's a rather boring movie . She said , "" All these people with Eastern dress , walking up and down , very repetitive , very limited . "" ( Laughter ) And she has a sense of humor . She knew it was a hallucination . But she was frightened . She 'd lived 95 years and she 'd never had a hallucination before . She said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing . That they seemed to come on by themselves , or disappear [ by themselves ] . She had no control over them . She said she did n't recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations . And none of the people or the animals , well , they all seemed oblivious of her . And she did n't know what was going on . She wondered if she was going mad , or losing her mind . Well , I examined her carefully . She was a bright old lady . Perfectly sane . She had no medical problems . She was n ' t on any medications which could produce hallucinations . But she was blind . And I then said to her , "" I think I know what you have . "" I said , "" There is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision , or blindness . "" "" This was originally described , "" I said , "" back in the 18th century , by a man called Charles Bonnet . And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome . There is nothing wrong with your brain . There is nothing wrong with your mind . You have Charles Bonnet syndrome . "" And she was very relieved at this , that there was nothing seriously the matter , and also rather curious . She said , "" Who is this Charles Bonnet ? "" She said , "" Did he have them himself ? "" And she said , "" Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome . "" ( Laughter ) "" I 'm not crazy . I 'm not demented . I have Charles Bonnet syndrome . "" Well , so I did tell the nurses . Now this , for me , is a common situation . I work in old-age homes , largely . I see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired . About 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations . And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations . You do n't have to be completely blind , only sufficiently impaired . Now with the original description in the 18th century , Charles Bonnet did not have them . His grandfather had these hallucinations . His grandfather was a magistrate , an elderly man . He 'd had cataract surgery . His vision was pretty poor . And in 1759 he described to his grandson various things he was seeing . The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair . It was large blue handkerchief with four orange circles . And he knew it was a hallucination . You do n't have handkerchiefs in midair . And then he saw a big wheel in midair . But sometimes he was n ' t sure whether he was hallucinating or not . Because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions . So on one occasion , when his granddaughters were visiting them , he said , "" And who are these handsome young men with you ? "" And they said , "" Alas , Grandpapa , there are no handsome young men . "" And then the handsome young men disappeared . It 's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash . They do n't usually fade in and out . They are rather sudden . And they change suddenly . Charles Lullin , the grandfather , saw hundreds of different figures , different landscapes of all sorts . On one occasion he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe , and realized it was himself . That was the only figure he recognized . On one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris , he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding . But when he got back home he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high , on his study table . This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia . With him , and with Rosalie , what seems to be going on -- and Rosalie said , "" What 's going on ? "" -- and I said that as you lose vision , as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input , they become hyperactive and excitable . And they start to fire spontaneously . And you start to see things . The things you see can be very complicated indeed . With another patient of mine , who , [ like Charles Lullin , still ] had some vision , the vision she had could be disturbing . On one occasion she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant . And he turned around . And then he divided into six identical figures in striped shirts , who started walking towards her . And then the six figures came together again , like a concertina . Once , when she was driving , or rather , her husband was driving , the road divided into four . And she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads . She had very mobile hallucinations as well . A lot of them had to do with a car . Sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car . He was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned . And then when they came to a stop , the boy would do a sudden vertical take off , 100 foot in the air , and then disappear . Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination . This was a woman who did n't have trouble with her eyes , but the visual parts of her brain . A little tumor in the occipital cortex . And , above all , she would see cartoons . These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen . And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog . ( Laughter ) Now , I do n't watch Sesame Street . But she made a point of saying , "" Why Kermit ? "" She said , "" Kermit the Frog means nothing to me . You know , I was wondering about Freudian determinants . Why Kermit ? Kermit the Frog means nothing to me . "" She did n't mind the cartoons too much . But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie , the faces were often deformed , with very large teeth , or very large eyes . And these frightened her . Well , what is going on with these people ? As a physician , I have to try and define what 's going on , and to reassure people . Especially to reassure them that they 're not going insane . Something like 10 percent , as I said , of visually impaired people get these . But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them . Because they are afraid they will be seen as insane , or something . And if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed . In particular , the notion is that if you see things or hear things , you 're going mad . But the psychotic hallucinations are quite different . Psychotic hallucinations , whether they are visual or vocal , they address you . They accuse you . They seduce you . They humiliate you . They jeer at you . You interact with them . There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations . There is a film . You 're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you . Or that 's how people think about it . There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy . And sometimes , if one has this , one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past . You 're at a particular road junction . You smell chestnuts roasting . You hear the traffic . All the senses are involved . And you 're waiting for your girl . And it 's that Tuesday evening back in 1982 . And the temporal lobe hallucinations are all multisensory hallucinations , full of feeling , full of familiarity , located in space and time , coherent , dramatic . The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different . So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations , you have all sorts of levels , from the geometrical hallucinations , the pink and blue squares the woman had , up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces . Faces , and sometimes deformed faces , are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations . And one of the second commonest is cartoons . So , what is going on ? Fascinatingly , in the last few years , it 's been possible to do functional brain imagery , to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating . And in fact , to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating . When people have these simple geometrical hallucinations , the primary visual cortex is activated . This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns . You do n't form images with your primary visual cortex . When images are formed , a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe . And in particular , one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus . And it 's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus , they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces . But if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus , they may hallucinate faces . And this is exactly what you find in some of these people . There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented . And that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations . There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons . It 's activated when one recognizes cartoons , when one draws cartoons , and when one hallucinates them . It 's very interesting that that should be specific . There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes . Around 1970 it was found that there were not only particular parts of the brain [ involved ] , but particular cells . "" Face cells "" were discovered around 1970 . And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells , which can be very very specific . So you may not only have "" car "" cells , you may have "" Aston Martin "" cells . ( Laughter ) I saw an Aston Martin this morning . I had to bring it in . And now it 's in there somewhere . ( Laughter ) Now , at this level , in what 's called the inferotemporal cortex , there are only visual images , or figments or fragments . It 's only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion . And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome you do n't go to those higher levels . You 're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images , or figments , or fragmentary figments , all neurally encoded , in particular cells or small clusters of cells . Normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception , or imagination . And one is not conscious of them . It is only if one is visually impaired , or blind , that the process is interrupted . And instead of getting normal perception , you 're getting an anarchic , convulsive stimulation , or release , of all of these visual cells , in the inferotemporal cortex . So , suddenly you see a face . Suddenly you see a car . Suddenly this , and suddenly that . The mind does its best to organize , and to give some sort of coherence to this . But not terribly successfully . When these were first described it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams . But in fact people say , "" I do n't recognize the people . I ca n ' t form any associations . "" "" Kermit means nothing to me . "" You do n't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams . Well , I 've more or less said what I wanted . I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common . Think of the number of blind people . There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them . So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice , for patients , for doctors , for the public . Finally , I think they are infinitely interesting , and valuable , for giving one some insight as to how the brain works . Charles Bonnet said , 250 years ago -- he wondered how , thinking these hallucinations , how , as he put it , the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain . Now , 250 years later , I think we 're beginning to glimpse how this is done . Thanks very much . ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : That was superb . Thank you so much . You speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients . Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about ? Oliver Sacks : I was afraid you 'd ask that . ( Laughter ) Well , yeah , a lot of them . And actually I 'm a little visually impaired myself . I 'm blind in one eye , and not terribly good in the other . And I see the geometrical hallucinations . But they stop there . C. A. : And they do n't disturb you ? Because you understand what 's doing it . It does n ' t make you worried ? O. S. : Well they do n't disturb me any more than my tinnitus . Which I ignore . They occasionally interest me . And I have many pictures of them in my notebooks . I 've gone and had an FMRI myself to see how my visual cortex is taking over . And when I see all these hexagons and complex things , which I also have , in visual migraine , I wonder whether everyone sees things like this , and whether things like cave art , or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit . C. A. : That was an utterly utterly fascinating talk . Thank you so much for sharing . O. S. : Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) </content"	Information/Explanation

31	"Ruth 1 Naomi and Ruth 1 In the days when the judges ruled , [ a ] there was a famine in the land , and a man from Bethlehem in Judah , together with his wife and two sons , went to live for a while in the country of Moab . 2 The man's name was Elimelech , his wife's name Naomi , and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion . They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem , Judah . And they went to Moab and lived there . 3 Now Elimelech , Naomi's husband , died , and she was left with her two sons . 4 They married Moabite women , one named Orpah and the other Ruth . After they had lived there about ten years , 5 both Mahlon and Kilion also died , and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband . 6 When she heard in Moab that the LORD had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them , Naomi and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there . 7 With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah . 8 Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law , "" Go back , each of you , to your mother's home . May the LORD show kindness to you , as you have shown to your dead and to me . 9 May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband . "" Then she kissed them and they wept aloud 10 and said to her , "" We will go back with you to your people . "" 11 But Naomi said , "" Return home , my daughters . Why would you come with me ? Am I going to have any more sons , who could become your husbands ? 12 Return home , my daughters ; I am too old to have another husband . Even if I thought there was still hope for me â even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons â 13 would you wait until they grew up ? Would you remain unmarried for them ? No , my daughters . It is more bitter for me than for you , because the LORD's hand has gone out against me ! "" 14 At this they wept again . Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by , but Ruth clung to her . 15 "" Look , "" said Naomi , "" your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods . Go back with her . "" 16 But Ruth replied , "" Do n't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you . Where you go I will go , and where you stay I will stay . Your people will be my people and your God my God . 17 Where you die I will die , and there I will be buried . May the LORD deal with me , be it ever so severely , if anything but death separates you and me . "" 18 When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her , she stopped urging her . 19 So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem . When they arrived in Bethlehem , the whole town was stirred because of them , and the women exclaimed , "" Can this be Naomi ? "" 20 "" Do n't call me Naomi , [ b ] "" she told them . "" Call me Mara , [ c ] because the Almighty [ d ] has made my life very bitter . 21 I went away full , but the LORD has brought me back empty . Why call me Naomi ? The LORD has afflicted [ e ] me ; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me . "" 22 So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter-in-law , arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning . Ruth 2 Ruth Meets Boaz 1 Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side , from the clan of Elimelech , a man of standing , whose name was Boaz . 2 And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi , "" Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor . "" Naomi said to her , "" Go ahead , my daughter . "" 3 So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters . As it turned out , she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz , who was from the clan of Elimelech . 4 Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters , "" The LORD be with you ! "" "" The LORD bless you ! "" they called back . 5 Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters , "" Whose young woman is that ? "" 6 The foreman replied , "" She is the Moabitess who came back from Moab with Naomi . 7 She said , ' Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters . ' She went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now , except for a short rest in the shelter . "" 8 So Boaz said to Ruth , "" My daughter , listen to me . Do n't go and glean in another field and do n't go away from here . Stay here with my servant girls . 9 Watch the field where the men are harvesting , and follow along after the girls . I have told the men not to touch you . And whenever you are thirsty , go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled . "" 10 At this , she bowed down with her face to the ground . She exclaimed , "" Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me â a foreigner ? "" 11 Boaz replied , "" I 've been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband â how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before . 12 May the LORD repay you for what you have done . May you be richly rewarded by the LORD , the God of Israel , under whose wings you have come to take refuge . "" 13 "" May I continue to find favor in your eyes , my lord , "" she said . "" You have given me comfort and have spoken kindly to your servant â though I do not have the standing of one of your servant girls . "" 14 At mealtime Boaz said to her , "" Come over here . Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar . "" When she sat down with the harvesters , he offered her some roasted grain . She ate all she wanted and had some left over . 15 As she got up to glean , Boaz gave orders to his men , "" Even if she gathers among the sheaves , do n't embarrass her . 16 Rather , pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up , and do n't rebuke her . "" 17 So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening . Then she threshed the barley she had gathered , and it amounted to about an ephah . [ a ] 18 She carried it back to town , and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered . Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough . 19 Her mother-in-law asked her , "" Where did you glean today ? Where did you work ? Blessed be the man who took notice of you ! "" Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working . "" The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz , "" she said . 20 "" The LORD bless him ! "" Naomi said to her daughter-in-law . "" He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead . "" She added , "" That man is our close relative ; he is one of our kinsman-redeemers . "" 21 Then Ruth the Moabitess said , "" He even said to me , ' Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain . ' "" 22 Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law , "" It will be good for you , my daughter , to go with his girls , because in someone else 's field you might be harmed . "" 23 So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished . And she lived with her mother-in-law ."	Prose/Lyrical

1641	When describing the motion of objects in terms of distance , time , and direction , physicists use the basic quantities of speed and velocity . Two terms , two distinct meanings . Yet , not uncommonly , we hear these terms used interchangeably . So , what 's the difference ? Why is it incorrect to use the terms speed and velocity interchangeably ? The reason is simple . Speed is the time rate at which an object is moving along a path , while velocity is the rate and direction of an object's movement . Put another way , speed is a scalar value , while velocity is a vector . For example , 50 km / hr ( 31 mph ) describes the speed at which a car is traveling along a road , while 50 km / hr west describes the velocity at which it is traveling . The mathematical calculation for speed is relatively straightforward , wherein the average speed of an object is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time it took the object to travel the distance . Velocity , on the other hand , is more complicated mathematically and can be calculated in different ways , depending on what information is available about the object's motion . In its simplest form , average velocity is calculated by dividing change in position ( Îr ) by change in time ( Ît ) .	Information/Explanation
1492	Four-step guide to investing in shares : 1 ) Keep track of your shares . Make sure no major event has occurred that may affect the fundamentals of the company . Usually you may not bother about the fundamentals of the company . Usually you may not bother about the fundamentals while choosing a derivatives strategy . But never do a covered call on a fundamentally unsound company . 2 ) Avoid volatile shares . Opt for shares that rise gradually or move in a range . 3 ) At the end of any month , sell only the near-month options and not the mid-month ones . For example , at the end of July one should sell the August-maturity call option and not the September-maturity one . It can be mathematically proved , and also been seen that one usually makes more money this way . 4 ) Leave room for the share price : selection of strike price must depend on the view of the share price , and not on the yield by selling the option . The best-sold options are those that do n't get exercised against you-not those that give you higher upfront fee .	Instruction
606	"Things to worry about , and having faith Posted on Mar 3rd , 2011 . 3134 comments When my son was one minute old , he taught me something about life . The nurse handed him to me and in those first few seconds , I felt relief . The months of anxiety were over . My naÃ¯ve thought was : I can stop worrying now . I held onto that belief for as long as it took to exhale and draw in one breath . Then I realized my worries were n't over . They were just beginning . So I guess what I learned was : It never ends . Zane's eighteen now . Things have more or less worked out . Still , last night my wife woke up around midnight , worried that he did n't have enough gas to get to school in the morning . I could hear rain hitting the window . I almost asked if she wanted me to go out and check the gauge . But I did n't . Never ask a question you do n't want to know the answer to . A manuscript is like a kid that way , at least for me . The day Tin House said they 'd take my book , I thought I 'd reached the finish line . Instead , there 's a whole new universe of things to obsess over . Should I be promoting it more ? Am I tweeting too much ? What if Tin House has changed their mind about publishing it ? I have n't heard from them in a while . Should I call them just to be sure ? What about reviews ? Should I even read them ? Last Sunday I finished Tom Grimes' brilliant memoir , Mentor . It 's the story of Grimes' life as a writer and his time at the Iowa Writers' Workshop . Grimes' mentor is Frank Conroy ; their relationship is at the heart of the story . It 's an amazing book . Publishers Weekly gave it a starred review . Initially , I thought the appeal of reading Mentor would be in seeing the path I did n't take . At about the same time Grimes went to Iowa , I quit my day job , started freelancing and tried to teach myself to write fiction . I thought it would take five years . It took much longer . But although those two paths are different , they have something in common . A writer's life is irrational , as Grimes says Conroy says . And you inflict all sorts of crap on yourself along the way . Irrational worries . Twice I put the book down and said , that 's enough . It 's too close to the bone . The problem is , it 's not the kind of book you can stop reading . When I finished Mentor on Sunday night , one gift it gave me was a sense of resolve . I promised myself not to let the world define Wire to Wire for me . Reviews do n't matter . The world , being a kind and gentle place , let me hold onto that belief for almost 12 hours before outing me as a hypocrite . The next morning Publishers Weekly gave Wire to Wire a starred review and made it Pick of the Week . So hold that thought . It turns out reviews do matter . As long as they 're good . As for my resolve not to read them ... hey , revision is everything in writing . That includes revising my beliefs . Somebody tell me if I 'm tweeting too much , though .

1002	"New figures from the International Air Travel Association ( IATA ) reveal that international passenger numbers are on the rise . International air passenger traffic in the first four months of 2005 was 8.7 per cent higher than the same period in 2004 . Year-on-year figures for April showed a 7.5 per cent increase . There was also a 4.7 per cent year-on-year increase in Cargo traffic during the first four months of the year . However , capacity expansion lagged behind passenger traffic in all regions , averaging 73.6 per cent during the first quarter of this year . IATA director general Giovanni Bisignani warned that despite rising passenger numbers , soaring fuel costs were hitting airlines hard , predicting an industry loss of $ 5 . 5 billion ( ? 3 . 02 billion ) this year . "" However you look at it , 2005 is shaping up to be another difficult year for the airlines , "" he said . "" Fundamental and large-scale change is absolutely critical . "" The IATA is expected to press for further deregulation at its annual meeting in Tokyo next week , criticising governments and airports . Mr Bisignani told a press conference today : "" Airlines moved fast after September 11 , re-engineering , restructuring ... But governments have not played a role . """	News

Whether you need to have a root canal treatment for treating the diseased pulp of your tooth , or you need to lighter the shade of your teeth with the assistance of a great and incredible Professional Teeth Whitening procedure , you can think about this clinic , without any doubt ! How Does Tooth Whitening Work ? A professional procedure performed by a qualified dentistry specialist involves the usage of a gel containing bleaching agents called carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide . These agents work in a way similar to hair bleaching . When applied in the form of gel over the surface of the teeth , they penetrate into the porous enamel and cause a chemical reaction that results in the neutralization and elimination of the staining agents , which restores the white color . Before the teeth whitening procedure with dental ultrasonic scaler , a highly experienced dentist makes sure that the teeth are healthy and clean . Any cavities or periodontal problems are treated before whitening to ensure safe and effective results . After a thorough cleaning of the mouth , the dentist places a protective material over the gums to avoid irritation . The whitening gel is applied on the surface , and sometimes , light is used to accelerate the bleaching reaction and consolidate the results . The dentist may use gels of different strengths and concentrations , depending on the desired results . Successive applications and removal of the whitening gel result in progressive teeth whitening until the patient is satisfied with the color . Professional dentists would also not recommend whitening if they know that your enamel is damaged or the crown needs a restoration . In both the cases whitening would be a futile job . Bad eating habits are also determining factors behind tooth discoloration . Tobacco users and people who indulge too much in beverages or smoking for that matter might have discolored teeth . In such cases a genuine professional would never prescribe whitening , since it will cause further damage to the enamel . Whitening of teeth understandably needs professional advice .

It makes painful root canal treatments feel like a cakewalk . Equipped with latest tools and technology , treating every client on a personal basis and informing the well of the pros and cons of every treatment makes Sparkly Whites a leader in its capacity . You can click the http://www.athenadental.com.au/category-1998-b0-Ultrasonic-Cleaner.html to find what you . Everyone wants to have nice teeth . It 's one of the few parts of our body that is impractical to cover up ( unless you never plan to smile or eat in public ) . So , for those of us who have issues with one or more crooked teeth , it can be an embarrassing dilemma . If you are considering a dental consultation , here are some of the potential remedies for straightening your teeth . Veneers â Also referred to as "" capping teeth , "" veneers are used when there are minor imperfections with your teeth , or when you only have a few teeth that are crooked and can not be fixed with braces . Your tooth will be shaved to create a flat or shallow surface . When the imperfection is removed with the shaving process , the tooth will be overlaid with porcelain to create a uniform appearance in your mouth . Braces â The common belief surrounding braces is that you will have a mouthful of metal for years . That could n't be further from the truth . Not only have braces become more discreet , but there are also options that can have you in and out of braces in six months or less . Accelerated orthodontics is a combination of dental surgery and orthodontic reinforcement techniques that can take as little as a quarter of the time of traditional braces . One of the reasons that makes the acceleration process possible is that your orthodontist may not focus on your back teeth if he or she does not have to . Accelerated orthodontics may involve periodontal surgery . This is performed with a local anesthesia . While you will feel some minor discomfort for a few days after the procedure , it is less painful than traditional orthodontics . The Inman Aligner , however , changes everything . It is a relatively new , simple and reasonably quick way of straightening teeth for adults . Teeth can be straightened in as little as 6 weeks ( 16 weeks for complex cases ) with no drilling and at about one-third of the cost of porcelain veneers or orthodontic treatment with dental supplies . It has now become the treatment of choice for crooked front teeth . It is a removable appliance that utilizes several springs that puts pressure on the teeth that need repositioning .

1437	"RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT & RESULTS from Extensive Studies by GolfScape Artificial Turf Manufacturers FACTS & FOES of Nylon vs. Artificial Grass Deep Infill "" Artificial Grass Deep Infill "" Systems vs. Nylon Synthetic putting greens are manufactured with several different materials . Two of the most common materials are polypropylene and nylon . A green made with nylon typically does not take an infill product , whereas a polypropylene green does . It is this artificial grass deep infill process that determines whether you birdie or bogey your game because of the advantage way that a surface , with artificial grass deep infill , reacts to your golf ball while putting and chipping onto the green . Non-filled synthetic putting greens obviously do not require infill . These greens are typically made of the nylon fiber . Nylon is what you see on miniature golf courses . Disadvantages of Nylon Problems with nylon synthetic putting greens : Nylon , a more porous fiber , will absorb water , retain odors , and lead to mold , mildew and fungus growth . Because a nylon green does not normally take an infill material , the fibers will "" mat down "" in a given time . When this happens the ball roll becomes very fast and there 's nothing that can be done to remedy the problem . In an attempt to resolve this issue , some companies will add infill to the turf , but because nylon is not designed to take an infill product , it just wo n't work . Many companies claim nylon fiber is "" heat set "" with "" memory "" and will not mat down . It simply makes sense that if there is nothing to support the fibers upright , they will mat down over time . Also , read the "" fine print "" of these companies' warranties on their nylon greens - "" normal matting or compression of fiber or compression of rubber and foam backing or padding is expressly excluded from the warranty "" . Draw you own conclusion from such contradicting statements . Nylon is a stiffer , more rigid fiber . A rigid fiber can also make the ball "" bounce "" or "" hop "" and not hold the green well . Furthermore , it has to be virtually flat for a nylon green to hold a golf ball . Although nylon greens should be built over a concrete slab , you might as well just take your penalty stroke and start over . Concrete will always crack or will always need joint for contraction and expansion . Joints and cracks will eventually agitate the green's surface creating visible ridges . Vice-versa , nylon turf with urethane backing will actually "" crawl "" across the surface creating wrinkles . A latex backing wo n't do this , but it will retain water and odors and lead to mold , mildew and fungus growth . For sure Stimp speed is not adjustable and undulations are almost nonexistent for a green built on a concrete slab . A concrete slab must have a slope for water drainage . The slope has to funnel water somewhere , which usually means towards the putting holes or all to one side of the green , resulting in puddles of stagnant water ; again leading to rot , mold and growth of fungus . If the nylon turf has a latex or rubber backing or padding , the problem is compounded . Rubber padding will compact and break down , forming irregular dips in the green , similar to what happens to an old worn out couch cushion . Stagnant water can accumulate under those too . Add that to the matted down fibers and you 've scored a "" double-bogey "" of a problem . Nylon fibers tend to be darker . A darker color gives the surface an unnatural blue-green appearance . Do n't take our word for it . Go to the internet and look at the photo galleries of companies selling nylon greens . You will notice greens that are abnormally dark or greens that actually look blue-green . Putting greens should "" accentuate , enhance and blend "" into the surrounding landscape , not detract from it . Nylon has streak lines caused either by inconsistencies of the dye lot or during the shearing process , which runs the length of the turf and can seriously hamper true ball roll . Final Note : Nylon greens cost almost twice as much as polypropylene . But because of the problems associated with nylon greens , you 're getting half of the product for twice the price . All of these problems combined are sure to handicap your short game . After extensive research of the fiber and manufacturing process , we have determined that the technology for nylon putting greens has yet to produce a putting surface that consistently provides true ball roll and holding characteristics of a real grass green . Polypropylene greens are the most realistic looking and have the most consistent surfaces . Its durable fiber can withstand all inclement weather conditions that Mother Nature can hurl at it . This increases the longevity of the green's life . They provide many more options for designing undulations , especially when built over a crushed sub-base . The fibers of an artificial grass deep infilled green are pre-bent and will not mat down over time They are maintenance free - : blow debris off with a leaf blower . Polypropylene greens have proven performance . Some companies claim that the taller the turf , the better the ball roll . They use a 1-1 / 2 turf , which requires much more infill product . More infill means that the fibers will be further apart . More distance between the fibers means the ball can roll on between fibers and infill , which is not a true and consistent ball roll . Usually a 1-1 / 2 fiber is used for the installations of synthetic football and soccer fields . These companies will try to adapt that fiber to a putting green surface , which signals the beginning to a multitude of frustrating problems . Some of these companies claim to be the manufacturer of their products . Buyer beware ! Most companies are simply the "" middlemen "" who sell products that they never actually see for themselves or who will sell factory "" seconds "" . A product may be classified as a second if there is color difference in the yarn used , a flaw or streak in the length of the material , or the backing is defective . Their "" manufactured "" products are not fully inspected for quality . Facts About Nylon Nylon golf greens offer the worst of all possible combinations . They are sold by "" sales people "" , not textile experts . At one time Dupont's nylon 6.6 dominated the sport field market place but was never intended for golf course applications . Except for commercial driving range golf mats , new fiber and infill technologies have virtually eliminated nylon from the sports turf and golf green scene . American Sports & Recreational Surfaces manufactures range mats with SFI monofilament nylon ( SFI is the available source for monofilament nylon in the United States ) . Golf greens using this nylon have "" streak "" lines . If you absolutely have to purchase a nylon golf green demand "" in writing "" that the turf will not have "" streaked "" lines in it . Nylon should be installed over concrete , not nailed down over sand or crushed stone . Nylon with a urethane secondary backing will expand and contract as the ambient temperature changes . This will cause the turf to "" crawl "" on top of the sub-base . Using spikes to hold down the perimeter edges will create bubbles and wrinkles in the turf . You are probably not installing the green for "" goofy golf "" but that is exactly what you will get when the turf bubbles , wrinkles or covers half the cup due to shifting . This is why outdoor nylon turf installations have always been a total direct glue down onto concrete , asphalt . E-Layer or other stabilized substrate . Nylon Golf Greens Will Not Hold A Shot Some companies are still selling nylon turf with an attached expanded urethane foam cushion for outdoor golf greens . These cushions are open cell products that absorb water , retain odors and have a fatigue factor . This will accept short chip shots until your golf green rots or your wife demands it 's removal . If you topdress this nylon turf with the sand these same sales people recommend you will have a nice hard surface to park your boat on . Nylon turf golf greens seem attractive because they are quick to install but the fact is that nylon should be limited to indoor installations where entertainment is the primary objective , rather than a tool to improve your golf game and your home value , if "" streaks "" are not a concern ."

432	"After studying the Wordtracker results for the MSN and Google search engines for words that include "" massage , "" we picked the third result , "" Techniques of Massage , "" because it 's an excellent and appropriate angle for our client . The # 1 result in MSN has a KEI of 3696 , but it would n ' t work with our client's site . You have to be sure to choose keyword phrases that are appropriate for your particular client's site . At MSN , "" Techniques of Massage "" has a KEI of 255 . Within a 24 - hour period , if your site was placed well in the MSN engine , you could expect to get 90 visitors from MSN alone . What is your competition ? 1954 . "" Techniques of Massage "" in Google has a KEI of 900 , 165 potential visitors through Google alone in a 24-hour period , and competition of only 555 . Remember that a "" good "" KEI is anything over 100 , and an "" excellent "" KEI is anything over 400 . Let 's be honest here . You could manage a top 10 for this keyword phrase with your eyes closed ( and your computer turned off ) . So , for our aromatherapy client , we could create a page on the various techniques of massage , including ( of course ) her oils and aromatherapy products . We would spend time on the page and give it true value to both the engines and the target audience . And , we would subtly add graphics and link text that points to the client's products in various areas of the page . John gave another example He says , "" If you 're selling ' digital cameras , ' do n't optimize for ' digital cameras . ' Did you know that everyone is searching for ' Digital Cameras Review ' ? Build a page offering reviews of digital cameras , which has a KEI that just blew me away . "" Another effective strategy : Top Reports Besides Comprehensive Search , John also likes to look at the top reports for high performance keywords or topics that are related to his client . John explains , "" I 'll review the Long Term Reports , which are the top 1000 keywords over the past 24 hours . Then , I cut and paste any topics related to my client into Comprehensive Search to get streams of currently ' hot topics . ' I define a hot topic as a popular topic in high demand , which may also have lists of related keywords phrases also in high demand . "" What happens if you ca n ' t find a hot topic that relates to your site in the top 1000 ? John answers , "" Many people do not know that Wordtracker offers extensive top word reports beyond the database . All you have to do is ask , and they 'll sell you : * The Top 20,000 words $ 99 * The Top 100,000 words $ 500 * The Top 500,000 words $ 2000 "" Additional suggestions * When John goes to Comprehensive Search , he does n ' t put in a huge list of keyword phrases . He types in one single word , then lets Comprehensive Search do the rest . This allows him to come up with ideas and angles that he would have never considered before . * Like John , spend a lot of time thinking of your target audience . Who are you trying to sell the products or services to ? There may be several target audiences , as in the case of our aromatherapy example . If so , go after keyword choices to target each of those audiences . * Do n't be afraid to let your creativity take hold . If your first few choices do n't work , continue trying . Using Comprehensive Search , it does n ' t take long to go back through the system with a different keyword idea . Keep going back until you find a possibility that might work for your site or the site of a client . * Be sure to give the surfer what they 're looking for when they choose your site from the search results . If you promised them "" techniques of massage , "" then be sure to give them good , solid content in that area , including related links . Weave your products and services throughout the page as you can . But , do n't ever try to trick a surfer . * If you get stuck and just ca n ' t find a keyword phrase with a high KEI and a low level of competition that will work for you , take a slightly different approach . Instead of trying to bring in a large amount of traffic through one single window , try creating several windows and bring in a little traffic through each one . Though more time consuming , this strategy can be equally effective in the long run . * If you are n ' t already a member of Wordtracker ( http://www.wordtracker.com ) , sign up for the free trial and test the system out for yourself . Pricing is very reasonable , depending on your needs . For example , you can use the service for a week for $ 19.94 , and many other plans are available . The bottom line is this : if you are serious about your Web site , you 've got to be serious about keyword choice . If you 're serious about keyword choice , Wordtracker is a "" must have "" service for you .
