3,"In November, the month of addiction prevention, members of the Local Action Group for Addiction Prevention will hold a series of expert lectures for parents of primary school children in Celje... <p/> The lectures, which will be organised this month at nine primary schools in the municipality of Celje, are aimed at parents of pupils in grades 6 to 9. The lecture programme is financially supported by the Municipality of Celje. The lectures will focus on the protective factors of education that can help to prevent drug use. Drugs, both licit and illicit, are increasingly being used by children. The lectures will also provide parents with information on what behavioural and physical changes to look out for when they suspect that their child has used drugs. Although the topic is topical, shedding light on effective parenting skills and communicating with children in conflict situations in addition to addiction problems, only 160 parents attended last year's series of lectures in eight primary schools. This time, the organisers hope for a better response. The series of lectures will be delivered by experts in medicine, psychology, social work and criminology.",News/Reporting,train

5,"Miscellaneous <p/> This year, for the 30th time, the Swiss compared all types of new cars on the basis of criteria set out years ago by the Heidelberg Institute for the Environment (IFEU). For the first time, hybrid cars lost first place to natural gas cars. <p/> Three eco-cars, the VW eco-up, the Skoda Citigo and the Seat Mii, took first place <p/> How the table is made The comparisons are always based on the latest scientific findings and the state of the art. Over the last ten years, new findings have continuously influenced the scoring, as the environmental impact of individual emissions has always been reconsidered. CO2 emissions, emissions of fine particulate matter, the burden on humans and the natural environment have become more important in the scoring. CO2 was found to be the main greenhouse gas, and vehicles account for one third of all emissions, which is why its share is so high. Interestingly, there are no electric cars on the list, as the assessors did not obtain reliable data on their characteristics. <p/> The table below shows all the passenger cars, from small to large, that scored the highest in the evaluation. <p/> Noise, toxins and nature In Switzerland, two thirds of people feel overwhelmed by noise, mainly from traffic. The constant noise environment causes stress and ill health, and is also bad for heart patients and cancer sufferers. Measurements have shown that the impact of the noisiest car is as disturbing to people as if ten cars with the lowest noise levels drove past at the same time. The most toxic substances are emitted by a vehicle on a cold start and depend on the type of fuel. They also point out that modern petrol injection engines emit extremely high levels of soot. They measure the impact on nature in terms of NOx emissions. Together with sulphur dioxide, they cause acidification of the soil, overfertilisation of soils and rivers, and are involved in the formation of harmful ozone peaks in summer. <p/> Impact prioritisation in the assessment <p/> Model selection Only vehicles emitting no more than 150 g of CO2 per kilometre, equivalent to 6.5 litres of fuel per 100 km, can be included in the assessment list. The exception is large cars with more than 5 seats, which can reach up to 180 g/km. Not all variants of one model have been considered in the comparison, as the list would be too long, so the more environmentally friendly variants have always been chosen. Niche models or vehicles from manufacturers with a negligible market share were also not considered. <p/> What the measurements showed Last year, the Lexus CT 200h Hybrid, a lower-mid-range vehicle, came first. This year, it was pushed into fourth place by three equivalent vehicles powered by a mix of natural gas and biogas, which is found at all gas stations in Switzerland. The first-placed VW eco up! also scores highly in terms of occupant safety, with the best result in the crash tests. The lack of occupant protection is therefore no longer an excuse to buy a car that is too big for its number. The new Toyota Yaris is out of the top ten due to excessive noise, even though it has an extremely low CO2 emission of only 79 grams per kilometre. <p/> The development of electric cars is moving very slowly. New models appear only sporadically, as customers do not show the necessary enthusiasm. Manufacturers also do not provide scientifically based data that can be used for evaluation. In addition, they find that the factory consumption data is not true and drivers should only charge their electric vehicles with green electricity to make them environmentally attractive, according to the evaluators.",Promotion,train
7,"JUDGMENT: The rule in Article 216 of the CCP allows the court (after the evidentiary proceedings) in the fact-finding proceedings to give a quantitative (numerical) estimate of the quantity given (claimed) (money or substitute items), of which it has only a qualitative idea on the basis of the evidence given. However, the court's discretion in question is not a substitute for the litigant's duty to gather the procedural material and does not relieve the party of the obligation to plead all the facts and to adduce the evidence on which it bases its claims (judgment and order of the Supreme Court, Op. No II Ips 250/2005 of 11.5.2006). <p/> CONCLUSION: The revision is dismissed. <The costs of the audit shall be borne by the auditee. <p/> SUMMARY: (1) The sums claimed in the application relate to the payment of the insurance premium (SIT 62,155,660.00) and to compensation for the damage allegedly suffered by the applicant as a result of the non-payment of the insurance premium (SIT 61,516,094.55 and EUR 1,081,484.50 in tolar equivalent). On 31.5.1996 the parties concluded an insurance contract (the Contract) under Policy No 814552, which was governed by the defendant's 'General Conditions for the Insurance of Animals', the 'Special Conditions for the Insurance of Fish in the Sea' and the addendum to that policy. The latter provided for the escape of fish from the applicant's cages as a result of a wind of the eighth degree of force on the Beaufort scale (gale) as an insured event. On 5 August 1997 the applicant reported the escape of 224 684 perch and sea bass. The Court of First Instance found that a storm had indeed raged between 25 and 27 December 1996, but held that the applicant had not proved that the number of fish allegedly escaped from its farm (from the cages on Platform III) as a result. <p/> (2) The Court of First Instance dismissed all the claims in their entirety. The Court of Second Instance dismissed the applicant's appeal against that judgment and, upholding all its findings of fact and conclusions of law, affirmed it. <p/> (3) The applicant challenges the judgment of the Court of First Instance in its entirety by way of revision. In it, he relies on ""all the grounds of review"" referred to in Article 370(2)(1), (2) and (3) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A.). The Court of First Instance is asked to uphold the review and to alter the judgment of the Court of First Instance by granting the claims in the action or, in the alternative, to set aside the judgments of the Courts of First Instance and Second Instance and to refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. <p/> (4) The review was served on the defendant, who did not reply, and on the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia. <p/> (5) The applicant was removed from the court register after all procedural steps in the review proceedings had been completed, with the exception of the issuance of the judicial decision. This act, which is a procedural act of the court, is not affected by the stay of the proceedings on the basis of the law itself (Article 205(1)(3) of the CPC), as the second sentence of Article 207(2) of the CPC is applied mutatis mutandis (thus the Supreme Court's judgment of 19.12.2006 in Case No III Ips 42/2006 as an expression of settled case-law). <p/> The revision is not justified. <p/> (6) The revision criticises the judgment of the court of second instance for a fundamental infringement of the provisions of the procedure referred to in Article 339(2)(14) of the Civil Procedure Code. It considers the infringement to be, in general terms, that the (contested) judgment of the court of second instance ""stated, contrary to the documentary evidence, some findings which contradict itself and which contradict the content of the documents or records of the depositions in the proceedings"". This is reflected, first, in the Court of First Instance's finding that, although the applicant, when reporting the damage on 30.12.1996, stated that 'a certain number of fish had also escaped', this nevertheless did not constitute a notification under policy No 8, but rather a notification of damage to the platform for a quarry on the platform. However, in order to satisfy the alleged ground of review, the judgment under appeal would have to be so defective as to preclude its review. That is not the case. The judgment under appeal is, in that respect (the last paragraph of the second page and the first paragraph of the third page of the grounds of appeal), capable of being reviewed: it is in agreement with the Court of First Instance, which itself gave full reasons (the last paragraph of the third page of the grounds of appeal).  <p/> (7) It is also possible to review the judgment under appeal (while the plea in law relied on is not raised) in so far as the auditor criticises it for contradicting the view that the plaintiff was late in declaring the escape of the fish in the light of the Contract and the provision of section 917(1) of the Law on Contractual Relations (LCCR) in force at the time, and the view that it did not forfeit its right to the benefit of the Contract as a result.  147 of the case-file) can be read without difficulty as meaning that the circumstances of the applicant's notification of the insured event - which was unusually (and unlawfully! ) late in the light of the care which the applicant, as a professional fish-farmer, should have been expected to exercise, and in the light of the applicant's established capacity to detect a significant decline in the number of fish (a 53 % escape of the insured population) - were taken into account by the court only in the context of its assessment of the evidence. The applicant did not (contrary to Article 918 of the Civil Code) lose its right to the sum insured by reason of the delay in informing the defendant, but its claims were dismissed on the ground that it had failed to prove the occurrence of the harmful event. <p/> (8) Finally, the judgment under appeal is reviewable even if the alleged illogicality between the assessment of the credibility of the farm workers who testified that the nets were blown down by the storm and the fish swam outside them and the evidentiary assessment that the plaintiff failed to prove the occurrence of the insured event were true. The assessment of the credibility of the workers in question is only part of the assessment of the evidence, which, however, was also assessed by the Court of Appeal on this point, with clear reasons (see the second paragraph of the third page of the reasoning). The substance of that evidential assessment itself, which is disputed by the auditor, on the ground that Platform I was completely destroyed in the storm, making it untenable to conclude that the fish did not escape from the nearby Platform III, is, as a question of fact, outside the scope of the review (Article 370(3) C.C.P.P.) <p/> (9) The substantive legal position of the Courts of Second Instance and First Instance, that the burden of proof of the occurrence of the insured event was on the claimant, is correct. It is not the case, as the Reviser submits, that the courts of second and first instance insisted that the claimant prove the escape of exactly 224 684 fish (see the third paragraph on page three of the judgment of the court of second instance). Their exact number could, in cases such as the present one, be determined (for the purposes of the litigation) by means of Article 216 of the CCP, but under conditions which are not met in the present case. <p/> (10) The rule in Article 216 of the CCP allows the court (after the evidentiary proceedings) in the fact-finding proceedings to give a quantitative (numerical) estimate of the quantity given (claimed in the action) (money or substitute goods) of which it has only a qualitative idea on the basis of the evidence adduced. That Article expressly provides that the court may do so if the amount of the sum claimed or of the replacement goods is either not ascertainable without disproportionate difficulty or not ascertainable at all. Neither of these (necessary, not sufficient) conditions is present in the present case. The court's discretion in question is not a substitute for the litigant's duty to gather procedural material and does not relieve a party of the duty to plead all the facts and propose evidence on which it bases its claims (Supreme Court judgment and order, Op. No II Ips 250/2005 of 11 May 2006). Since the procedural material gathered in the present case does not substantiate the assessment that any fish escaped as a result of the storm at all, the discretion of Article 216 of the Civil Procedure Code is inapplicable. The courts of first and second instance were therefore correct in finding against the applicant on the basis of the burden of proof. <p/> (11) In so doing, the Supreme Court has responded to the revisionist submissions, which are of decisive importance. Since the grounds relied on did not prove to be well-founded and since it did not otherwise find that the substantive law had been erroneously applied, it dismissed the revision as unfounded on the basis of Article 378 of the CPC. <p/> (12) The decision on the costs of the review is based on Article 165(1) of the CPC in conjunction with Article 154(1) of the CPC. The applicant is to bear its own costs.",Legal/Regulation,train

10,"UNICEF boosts support for education in the Horn of Africa as school year begins <p/> Nairobi, 9 September 2011 - UNICEF has boosted support for children's education in drought-affected countries in the Horn of Africa as the new school year begins. <p/> 13.9.2011 <p/> ""Schools and children's centres play an important role not only in basic education, but also in delivering life-saving messages on nutrition, hygiene, sanitation and health education - all vital skills for survival in today's Horn of Africa,"" said Elhadj As Sy, UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa. <p/> ""In refugee camps, schools are also accessible to girls and other vulnerable children who may never have set foot in a classroom before,"" added Elhadj As Sy. ""In vulnerable communities, school facilities also provide access to clean water, sanitation, nutrition programmes and safe spaces where children are protected from violence and abuse. ""<p/> In the affected countries of the Horn of Africa, crucial support to the school system was already provided before the start of the new school year: <p/> In Kenya, many schools were opened in drought-affected areas, including during the holidays, to provide access to nutrition programmes for 1.2 million children. In Somalia, 155 schools were opened with UNICEF support, supporting 37,000 children <p/> Since 2010, 28,000 children living in drought-affected areas have been able to access education through alternative school facilities and supplies <p/> Since the beginning of 2011, UNICEF has supported the education of some 120,000 displaced children in Somalia. More than 300,000 children will be supported in the coming months, including those attending one of the 1,500 rural schools in central and southern Somalia. In these areas, priority assistance will focus on the provision and establishment of long-term services for children who have remained in their hometowns or will return <p/> UNICEF's education partners are establishing child-friendly facilities for children to access clean water, food vouchers, adequate sanitation and psychosocial support. By 15 September, 350 child-friendly facilities for more than 30,000 children will have been set up in collaboration with partners. <p/> In Kenya, UNICEF, together with partners in schools and day-education centres, has provided equipment and supplies for more than 60,000 children to date - including beds, mattresses, school supplies and sports and recreation equipment. <p/> In Ethiopia, UNICEF and partners have provided temporary child-friendly spaces and school supplies for some 8,000 children.In addition, UNICEF facilitated the construction of four primary schools in Dollo Ado refugee camp and in two local communities where people from the affected areas have taken refuge <p/> In Dadaab refugee camp in north-eastern Kenya, UNICEF stepped up its support to children's education ahead of the new school year and reached out to needs on the ground, by providing school tents and supplies <p/> The current drought crisis in the Horn of Africa poses an enormous challenge for children's education in all affected countries. In central and southern Somalia, there are approximately 1.8 million children who are out of school because they are displaced and have fled their homes or are living in a conflict zone. In the arid areas of Kenya, where many refugees have sought refuge, local communities are stretched to provide accommodation for new pupils - one quarter of all schools in the area face a shortage of space.",News/Reporting,train

12,"Bullshit detector! <p/> Ekola, they told me to write a blogpost about something that happened at the conference! The most interesting talk, in my opinion, was given by Gustav Martner, Executive Creative Director of CP+B Europe (Crispin Porter + Bogusky Europe) <p/> Mr. Martner lectured about advertising, internet, media, his mom, cable TV, kids, about how the microphone crashes - yes it's true, a couple of times the microphone failed while he was lecturing, but what I liked the most was that he got the audience on his side when he said that the microphone is a bullshit detector (for those who don't count, the microphone stops working when Gustav is loading the microphone). Audience relaxed, attention gained. <p/>What did he say about the Internet as a medium? To sum it up in a few lines and a few more photos.

Does it mean that there is an end to the traditional advertisements that are collected from a few people and that are advertised with the brute force of online or offline marketing?

19,"Contributions <p/> More and more new and renovated housing is being built in a low-energy or even passive house concept. Low-energy buildings, and in particular passive buildings, are residential buildings whose primary purpose is to minimise energy consumption. <p/> By definition, a house should be low-energy when its heating energy demand is less than 50 kWh/(m ² a) and passive when it is less than 15 kWh/(m ² a). In practice, it may even be less than 10 kWh / (m ² a). <p/> Several factors are important for a building to reach these standards. The correct location and orientation, as well as the use of the right structures and materials, must be taken into account in the design and construction. <p/> The aim of this type of construction should be to minimise the energy used to heat and cool the building. <p/> This means that the following conditions must be met in the most efficient way possible: <p/> - use of solar energy directly through glass surfaces and indirectly through solar collectors for the production of domestic hot water, <p/> - the primary energy source for this type of building is the sun. However, in truth, we have to admit that in our region there are not many sunny days in winter. Therefore, on those days when the outside temperature is around 0°C or even lower, such facilities also need an additional source of energy. <p/> Most often, the additional source is a heat pump, which heats the building and provides the necessary amount of domestic hot water on cold days without solar radiation. <p/> As modern and technically sophisticated as heat pumps are, they also have drawbacks. As the ambient air temperature decreases, their efficiency decreases and the direct energy consumption increases. Another dilemma is what happens in the event of a power failure, which can sometimes last for a day or more. In this situation, this type of facility is completely helpless. <p/> All the above-mentioned devices - solar panels, heat pump and ventilation - are then useless. The very serious question is what to do in such a situation? <p/> One option is to use a solid fuel local heating system. But what kind? The building has a small, very meagre heat demand and all local solid fuel stoves are designed for a minimum of 6 kW and more. Such an installation would turn the building into a sauna, as the room temperatures would be significantly too high. But there is an answer, and that is a clay stove or a SMALL CLAY STOVE. <p/> 1 - Outside air inlet <p/> 2 - Fire door with glass <p/> 3 - Automatic combustion air inlet control <p/> 4 - Manual combustion air inlet control <p/> 5 - Fireclay combustion chamber - firebox <p/> 6 - Secondary combustion air inlet <p/> 7 - Afterburner zone <p/> 8 - Flue gas passage to flue ducts <p/> 9 - Fireclay flue ducts - 3m long <p/> 10 - Pottery lining <p/> 11 - Connection at top <p/> 12 - Connection at rear <p/> Most people think of a pottery stove as an artisan-built heating appliance, It is a stove heated with wood and heats one or at most two living spaces. We think of a rustic room, a mountain hut or a living room with a ceramic stove that warms the room in a cosy way. But in reality, the earthenware stove is an element that offers much more, because the possibilities of design and use of earthenware stoves in terms of design and thermal engineering are extremely wide. <p/> With the introduction of new living standards and the consequent construction of buildings with lower energy consumption, the need for individual solid fuel heating appliances of smaller size and power has become apparent. Manufacturers of earthenware stoves have identified a niche market and have adapted their products to this part of the market. We have developed so-called ""SMALL IRON STOVES"", which have the same characteristics as conventional designs, with the difference that they are smaller in terms of dimensions and heat output. <p/>Where are the advantages and why do customers choose such stoves? <p/> There is an increasing trend towards smaller living units and low-energy buildings where energy consumption is minimal and conventional solid fuel heating appliances are simply too powerful. <p/> Heat outputs of 1.2 - 3.0 KW using 3 to 5 kg of firewood per fire are ideal for this type of building. <p/> The operation of the combustion in the firebox is therefore completely independent of the room air. The combustion air can be controlled either manually or automatically. In the latter case, the microprocessor controls the air supply to the firebox via a control damper. <p/> The method of heat transfer by gentle radiation of the ceramic surfaces offers the most suitable solution in terms of health, comfort and convenience for man. As the proportion of convective heat transfer is lower due to the low surface temperatures, the movement of warm air through the room is also less intense, resulting in less dust particles being raised. This fact is particularly important for people with various allergies. <p/> The ability of fireclay materials to accumulate heat allows for a long heating cycle of up to 12 hours. This means loading firewood twice a day and thus very easy operation. <p/> Due to the modern technically sophisticated construction of the firebox and flue and thus the perfect combustion technique, the efficiency of the stove is very high, over 85, which means a low consumption of firewood and thus cheaper heating and less landfill. <p/> The perfect combustion results in high temperatures in the firebox, which means higher efficiency and more favourable emissions. <p/> The lifetime of such a stove is very long (at least one generation), which means that the investment is very rational. A long-term investment in a reliable, environmentally friendly and low-cost heating method. Maintenance and operation is simple. Wood biomass is used as the energy source, which is the most ecologically advantageous yet the cheapest. The glass fire door allows visual contact with the flame, which attracts people and offers them additional comfort.Installation is quick and clean. <p/> Design is also very important. In addition to the dimensional and design specificities, all stoves have a choice of glazing colours or colour combinations. With a choice of different glaze combinations, each customer can choose the colour idea that suits them. This gives each kiln a completely individual character tailored to the wishes and needs of the customer and makes it completely unique. <p/> And there is one more thing <p/> Every stove is an ornament and a decorative element in a room. In addition, firing and operating a tiled stove is a very special and enjoyable task. What makes it special is the pleasant radiation of heat through the walls of the stove and the many functional possibilities. The wood-burning fire is pleasantly felt through the open fireplace door, and fire has remained a source of heating from prehistoric times to the present day. Burning wood gives us a feeling of relaxation. It is a special ritual that is the same for each of the earthenware stoves. In each hearth, a large amount of energy is released when the fire is lit. This is stored in the fireclay mass of the earthenware stove and radiates into the room as a gentle, soft heat for hours afterwards. <p/> The heater operates independently of the electricity in the house or the oil in the tank. Pot stoves cover the need for heat in the way that ancestors once did. This is still the case today, and will continue to be the case long after oil and gas are long forgotten sources.",Promotion,train

If you have a friend who can calculate the electrical connections and interconnect them, you will make a car. <p/> Have you made a car yourself? <p/> Yes, I have, I converted a Citroen AX. <p/> In the book it describes the conversion to electricity where you use lead-acid batteries for the power supply, but later on LIFEPO4 is described, why? <p/> Yes, it's true, the vehicle first used lead-acid batteries, which didn't work very well, so I changed them. <p/> What about the type approval? <p/> The book describes the complete procedures for obtaining type approval. Care must be taken with protection, lead diameter and other details. Beware, this is a type-approval of a change to a propulsion engine. As no more than two modifications can be homologated at the same time, I do not advise you to make any other modifications besides the powertrain modification. When converting, it is worth modifying and re-approving the following: - change of power unit (ECE R-100) - change of tyre size (narrower tyres mean lower consumption) - change of exterior lighting (daytime running lights according to ECE R-87 save you a lot of energy) - tinting of windows (as air conditioning means extra energy consumption, it is advisable to keep the interior as warm as possible) - fitting a sunroof (for the same reason mentioned above) <p/> I am interested in cars, but I have no idea about electric vehicles. <p/> The book covers all the building blocks of an electric vehicle, so you will learn about all electrically powered vehicles from bicycles to cars. <p/> I have an old vehicle xxxxxxxxxxxxx can I use it for conversion? <p/> Yes, any vehicle can be converted, but be aware: - if the vehicle is old, it is probably no longer attractive, so an electric vehicle will lose its extra charm - if the vehicle is in poor condition and will need carpentry and refinishing, this will substantially increase the conversion time and final price - if the vehicle is too small, it will be difficult to find space for the batteries. - If the vehicle is too small, you will be limited by the amount of batteries installed, thus reducing range. - If the vehicle is too heavy or too large, you will spend more on the engine, which will have to be more powerful, and considerably more on the batteries. - If the vehicle is too new, you will have to find a programmer to adapt the vehicle controllers to the new powertrain. - If possible, choose a vehicle without any additional consumables, such as air conditioning, servo-van, hydraulic suspension, etc. <p/> You said that the power consumption of an electric bicycle does not vary between high and low speeds. What kind of regulation do you have? With PWM frequency control there should be a difference. <p/> Yes it does in theory and with an unloaded bike. However, the case is slightly different under load and when using a simple PWM controller and a DC motor. Because only the energy part that the electric motor needs is important... <p/> Power is U * I, because the voltage is constant, only the current affects the operation, which varies with the load and not so much with the DT, because the DT only controls the width of the required energy packets and thus affects the motor speed. <p/> If you wanted to control e.g. 1000 rpm you would have to capture the speed on the axle and then you would clearly see the opening and closing of the DT and the different energy consumption through the amperage. <p/> The motor changes its impedance depending on the load, as the impedance is related to the magnetic field (like a loudspeaker), which in turn affects the current passing through the motor.",Other,train
21,"Posts tagged 'incinerator' <p/> In the autumn 2010 issue of Dupličan, Bogdan Pogačar published the following article, which we reproduce in full: <p/> A directive of the European Union required Member States to issue new permits, or to re-examine and, if necessary, renew existing permits, for all industrial installations that started operating before 30 October 1999 by 30 October 2007. <p/> Slovenia is one of only six countries not to comply with the EU's Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, and will have to defend itself before the European Court of Justice. It faces a fine of €80 million, which the country will have to pay over the next four years. Given that the inhabitants of the southern part of the municipality of Kamnik (Perovo, Bakovnik, Šmarca, Volčji Potok, Duplica) regularly have legitimate concerns about the quality of the air they breathe, which is part of their everyday lives, such indifference on the part of the State is incomprehensible to me. The fact is that we live in a densely populated area and in close proximity to industrial plants that pollute the air with emissions from their activities. Of course, these are companies that have been operating here for many years and cannot be relocated elsewhere, but everything must be done to reduce emissions into the air. It is not just about the health of the most vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly, but also about reducing the value of movable and immovable property in the area. <p/> The most painful thorn in our side is the 'environmentally unfriendly' operation of the Tisa Ltd. wood biomass heating plant, which has been preventing us from enjoying a good quality of life for 13 years.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

26,"In the fashion world, there are supposed to be rules of dress that real fashion enthusiasts do not follow. What is right and what is wrong has recently become even more of a subjective decision for the individual, so it is right that we should also debunk some of the fashion myths that we have blindly followed up until now. Why is this happening? Because fashion history is unfolding in such a way that what was once fashionable, which has become unfashionable, is now ""in"" again. But with an innovative twist. <p/> Rule No.1 - Same shoes and same handbag <p/> Once such an important rule that we held sacred, but nowadays you can safely forget it. Where we used to be on the lookout for shoes that matched our handbag, now we look for shoes that complement, contrast or even just match in a small detail. Give yourself a break and treat yourself to a crazy combination of a neon handbag and floral sandals. <p/> Rule No. 2- Don't mix patterns <p/> Mix them up to no end! If the designers of famous brands and fashion gurus can mix them, then so can you. You can look for inspiration from designers like D&G, Betsey Johnson, Preen and Mary Katrantzou, and many more. If you can't find your own designs on the shelves of the more affordable clothing brands, there are fabulous designer goods available in metro stores where they can make you the garment you want. <p/> Rule No. 3 - The older you get, the more you ""cover up"" <p/> It's like life after 40 is over! The vast majority of women look much better in their 40s than many women in their 20s. And if you have all the attributes of youth, why hide them? If you still have perfect legs at 45, treat yourself to a knee-length skirt and heels. Just make sure you don't overdo it and don't dress in clothes designed for 20-year-olds. Mini-skirts only suit 20-year-old girls anyway. <p/> Rule No 4- Never wear tights or open-toed socks <p/> If you had dared to step out on the street in such an outfit a few years ago, you would have been met with a lot of ridicule and strange looks. But nowadays, many women are wearing this very combination! Take Rihanna or Alexa Chung, who have taken the fashion world by storm with their unique styles. Now it's time to pair your favourite tights with summer open toes and a short skirt. <p/> Rule No. 5 - underwear must never show through your clothes <p/> Remember when we used to hide our bra straps with fervor? Or better still, the whole bra, just so it wouldn't show. And when we came across the sheer material of a beautifully tailored blouse, we were in for a big surprise, precisely because of the visibility of the underwear. Fashionistas don't even remember that myth anymore, let alone follow it! For peace of mind, you can have a sheer white blouse and your favourite coloured bra.

34,"Kurtic finally takes Allegri away <p/> Ljubljana - Massimiliano Allegri paid dearly for Milan's painful defeat against Sassuolo, for whom Slovenian international Jasmin Kurtic also plays. The former Perugia coach was left without a job the day after the defeat. <p/> Massimiliano Allegri announced some time ago that he would retire from the Milan bench at the end of the season. The 3:4 defeat against Sassuolo, after the rossoneri had already led 2:0, meant that his story on the bench of the seven-time European champions had already ended a few months earlier. Domenico Berardi, 19, was fatal for Milan and Allegri, taking Sassuolo fans to heaven even after two passes from Jasmin Kurtic, while Milan supporters wondered how low their favourites could go. <p/> After the new defeat, the red-and-blacks remain in 11th place, just six points above the places leading to the second league and a whopping 30 points behind leaders Juventus. Milan have not been this low for a long time. Who can lead it out of the abyss? For some time now, Clarence Seedorf, who is contracted to Botafogo, has been mentioned as the most serious successor to Allegri, and Filippo Inzaghi, who is gaining his first coaching experience in Milan's youth team, is also among the very serious candidates. Allegri's legacy Milan have played far below the expectations of the fans this season under Allegri's leadership. But the question is who could get more out of Milan's current squad. Valter Birsa, on whom Allegri has shown great confidence, has also scored for the two Serie A victories. Otherwise, Allegri had a mediocre squad, which would have had a hard time in the fight for the top spots. <p/> Allegri came to the world's fashion capital in 2010 and won the title right away.

36,"For brave people, bankruptcy can mean the start of something new, better, more prosperous and happier. <p/> But bankruptcy for a company or an individual does not mean failure. On the contrary. For brave people, it can mean the start of something new, better, more successful and happier. <p/> For myself, I still claim to be rich. Wealth is family, healthy children and personal health. It is contentment with what we have and it is happiness in the face of everyday joys and difficulties. It is vision, purpose and hope and fighting for all that we love. <p/> Wealth is not necessarily wealth for a company or even for an individual. <p/> A company's assets, or even an individual's, are not necessarily wealth. Wealth is a concern, it is a commitment to increase or at least maintain the value of wealth. It is an ongoing obligation towards employees, the state and others. It requires daily care to ensure that it is used economically and efficiently and that it creates added value from which employees earn their living. For this reason, and above all for this reason, asset owners and managers deserve special respect. Unfortunately, in Slovenia we are not at a spiritual stage of development in social relations and values to understand this. Too often people mistakenly think that wealth makes people happy. They mistakenly believe that people who lose their wealth also lose their happiness. <p/> But many people only find happiness or realise it when they do. It is only then that they realise that there are other things than the satisfaction of managing wealth and a business. <p/> These realisations also make my pain at the shipwreck of the company more bearable.

The first training session was attended by ten first team players who were interviewed by the Portuguese coach, namely Dudek, who has extended his contract until June 2011, Adam, Garay, Marcelo, Drenthe, Gago, Diarra, Granero, Lass and Benzema. They were joined in training by the ""canteranos"" Carvajal, Tebar, Nacho, Alex, Denis Tcherysev, Fran Rico, Joselu and Morata. The first part of the training session was led by the fitness coach Rui Faria, so the players did specific exercises, dominated by drills to get the players in the best condition. The first training session started at 9:20 and after the warm-up, the players performed muscle strengthening exercises to avoid any inconvenience during the first training session on the pitch. Later on, at 9:45, it was time for the ball, so the players split up into several groups. At 10:20, Jose Mourinho started his instructions, explaining to all players that he wanted to train with the ball with only one touch, while Adam and Dudek trained separately under the guidance of Silvino Louro, the new goalkeeping coach. Before the end of the training session, the Portuguese coach also put three small goals on the pitch and the players were able to practice for the first time [ ... ] <p/> Pedro León Sánchez Gil (Murcia, 24-11-1986) is a midfielder who usually plays on the right wing. Although he is only 23 years old, he has already played for Murcia, Levante, Valladolid and Getafe, and has also made six appearances for the Spain Under-21 national team. Pedro León is a solid winger with excellent ball control with both feet. He is a fast player who can play on both the left and right wing, and is also excellent at taking shots from standard positions. The new Real Madrid player started his football career in Mula, Murcia, as a member of the Muleña youth school and later at Nueva Vanguardia Alcantarilla before signing for Real Murcia. In 2005, he also made his debut in the second division for Real Murcia. In his three seasons at Real Murcia, Pedro León played 71 matches and scored 10 goals. In the summer of 2007 he signed for Levante, where he stayed for only one season, during which time he played 27 games and scored 3 goals. On 1 September 2008 Pedro León signed for Real Valladolid. In 2008/09 he played 36 games for the club and scored 6 goals.

So the day the players return is mainly to see how much they weigh and to calculate the body mass index for each one.

56,"17 replies to "" Even in the municipality of Ravenna "" in a domestic way "" "" <p/> What is it with this journalist that she writes things that are two years old, and populist ones at that. The SDS party got 10 councillors and a mayor. The SD party got two councillors, Zares got 3 councillors, the NSI got one, etc... Around the same time, the seats on the committees were also divided up, or the SDS got even fewer than it could have. Check the data available. The most important is the Supervisory Committee, where the opposition has the chair and the majority of members. In this way, things are 'balanced'. Of course, the glass can always be half full or half empty, depending on which eyes are looking at it. It is normal, however, that the opposition always wants to minimise the successes and inflate the weaknesses to the extreme. All credit to the mayor and his team for what they have achieved in the town, and it may not be all good, but it is far from all bad. <p/>It is only the political staffing that bothers me, but I would like to point out that many of these SDS directors have improved things and put things on the right footing, and nobody mentions that. I am not taking sides, but I think that, yes, it is not all black. Many times when I go to the flatlands, where I was born, I find that many people are negative, and they all tell the same stories, and it is quite clear to me that somebody has set them up against the mayor. But perhaps we already know of a candidate for mayor in the forthcoming local elections? ? ? It also bothers me that the freedoms are being used for the benefit of one political party, namely the SD. Its members are always at these protests, and in this case the protests, which I support, are taking on political overtones. People should say what they think, not be persuaded to do so by one political option. <p/> After all, it is the SD, or the young forum, that is behind everything, and they have their noses up in everything good that is done in Ravenna. And what the fuck is that to the demonstrator in front of the municipality from Ravne! Let the others go and demonstrate in front of their municipalities, because in the end Prevale has two vice-mayors. No, it is only Ravne that is under attack. The Young Forum of the Mežiška dolina Valley is, as far as we can understand, the young forum of the whole valley, not just Ravne, and they should do something elsewhere, not just go around Ravne on the orders of their silver uncles from behind the scenes. <p/> Who reads this red Dnevnik ... and just ask yourselves and investigate who paid some money to this Mojca to write such an article (a paid article). Kudos to Mayor Rozen, he has done a lot for the people ... but only those who want to line their pockets are slandering ... a little morgen, you will be waiting ... <p/> I have to speak up. I am an ordinary citizen just observing what is happening in Ravne. I am also interested to see the recordings of the municipal council meetings. I must say that I am VERY SATISFIED with the leadership of our municipality. However, it is obvious that Councillors Halilovič and Vrhovnik are doing everything they can to undermine the work of the mayor and his team. What is the purpose of such action is clear to all. Because they feel that there is not enough publicity at the meetings themselves, they have to take to the streets. That is why I was not surprised to see, in the video footage of the assembly in front of the municipal building, mainly supporters of the pole that has too few members on the municipal council. Therefore, people - do not be fooled into thinking that this assembly was about improving the situation. It was about letting the street allow those who failed in the elections to rise - whether that is good or bad for the citizens. <p/>I see you are all more right-wing up here, I tell you we have a trunk full of your politics and don't dream that only reds are protesting in the street. I for one am for honest politics be it left or right, I have no bad words for Rozen but I don't think he has kept the right deputy mayor. <p/> Aljaž Vrhovnik will be loud? A teenager who rushes to the trough more than a calf to a cow, pretending to be clever about things that logically he has no clue about, because he is simply being a child. I have nothing against young people, but what is too much is too much, and he is running for mayor - and half the stupid journalists quote him. I don't know who is the bigger half-ass. Vrhovnik was lying drunk in front of Presa last weekend, why don't you write about it) <p/> Zlatko Halilovič -&gt; has he raised his voice? Logically, it is more difficult to do anything else. <p/> Blog author: Why don't you publish what is the difference between the annual salary of a councillor and a deputy mayor? Aren't you interested? <p/> And to the left- and right-wing narrow-minded, greetings and a happy and prosperous 2013, in deeds, not in words. <p/> The Governor is supposed to be a representative of young people, but not enough to stand up for young people and their interests. But he is only looking at his own narrow interests, how to make a political career, no matter how much it costs, and who he is going to shit on for it. Shame! It is also a shame what kind of representatives the youth have in our country - they (we) are guilty of this, unfortunately - but why do we give such people a voice?

57,"Jerry is leaving <p/> If you wanted to add symbolism to the script for the end of Andre Jerman's career, you would actually have only two options: win or lose. Unfortunately, fate chose the latter. The best Slovenian downhill skier of all time and still the only winner of a World Cup race on the men's side did not want to take much time to think about the next steps after his recent accident in Kitzbühel. <p/> As if he wanted to get rid of the burden as quickly as possible and push the stone away from his heart, he announced his appearance in front of the seventh force shortly after his return to Tržič. Although his announcement was expected, it was far from easy. ""Number 36 was the last number I wore. It was time to say goodbye to a sport that has given me so much. It was not an easy decision. It was already difficult to come back this year and ' throw myself ' upside down. A period of no real results followed. In Wengen I got a new mark, my knee got stuck. But I did it anyway. I almost fell in the race too. I told my wife that I would decide after Kitzbühel. Well, Kitzbühel decided for me. If I had been healthy, I would have persevered. But when you don't feel the right conviction and confidence in yourself, you have to stop. I am happy with my career. I have always given my best. Sometimes maybe even too much.

I was also lucky enough to have the right people by my side who supported me,"" the 34-year-old Tržič skier said with a shaking voice at the headquarters of the Slovenian Ski Federation, where he has been coming for champagne and for tough negotiations with the management in recent years. <p/> Andrej Jerman started his career in his home village of Zelenica, and has impressed in Weng, Bormio, Kitzbühl, Garmisch... Although his announcement was expected, it was far from easy for him. ""Number 36 was the last number I wore. It was time to say goodbye to a sport that has given me so much.

For a long time, after all, Slovenians were considered to be only technical skiers with a daring excursion into the supervelles slalom. Jerman, on the other hand, made history in downhill, the fastest and for many the royal discipline. He will always be remembered as the first Slovenian winner of a World Cup downhill event. He was not a one-day flyer either, winning twice and finishing second and third, proving his quality and showing his mettle on a variety of terrain. His stability and excellence are also reflected in his breakthrough into the elite seven of the World Cup. He has finished two seasons in a row among the fastest. With a slight time lag, his skiing transformation was followed by his progression in the Super-G, where he never reached the podium, but finished fourth twice. <p/> His pioneering achievements paved the way for his compatriots. Already when he was breaking through, the national team formed a team for the fast disciplines under the leadership of Jože Gazvoda, his father, who was also a skier. After a few flashes from Peter Pena, Gašper Šparovec and before that Ales Brezavšek, ""Jerry"" was the first to prove that it is not an end in itself and that it is worth investing in the ski ranks. The ""speedsters"" were getting bigger and better, and as a result, the technical defector Andrej Šporn, Rok Perko, Alek Glebov, Gašper Markič and finally the promising Boštjan Kline started to make their way to the World Cup. <p/> It started very early, far away from the cameras. At the age of 13, he ended his skiing on the Soriška planina mountain when he collided with a spruce tree and broke both his legs. But it was at that point in his career that his stubbornness and perseverance came to the fore. A year later, he won the traditional Ponochio Cup and went on to show his talent in all age categories. Unfortunately, along with his skiing skills, he then brought a wave of injuries to the competition. The recent fall in Kitzbühel was not his only one at Streif. He paid the price of youthful enthusiasm and perhaps too little respect in his first encounter with the famous slope. He left the Rooster Ridge with damaged knee ligaments. Shortly after his rehabilitation, he broke it again, this time on the Zermatt glacier, and once again his knee was struck. Then, just when it looked like he had fulfilled his injury bonus, he fell again in 2004 and injured his knee for a third time. With all these injuries, the wrist fracture and the shoulder pain after falling off the chairlift are marginal. <p/> More fatal for Jerman was a fall at the start of the 2011/12 season, when he was already contemplating the end of his career after crashing into the guardrail of the Birds of Prey track in Beaver Creek. But he decided to rehab his injured knee and return to the World Cup caravan. He went ahead with his plan, but another fall prevented him from completing it. This time in Kitzbühel. Although it was ""only"" a concussion, and fortunately the ligaments and bones remained intact, it was the last one of his career. <p/> Martin Pavčnik, Siol.net <p/> Biggest successes: 2 World Cup ski race wins (Garmisch 2006/07 and Bormio 2009/10) and two more top 3 finishes.

62,"Heh, but this kind of statement baffles me... are these compartmentalising people consistent? So dogs are supposed to be lonely according to them. What about for the fish? What about cats? Or chinchillas? What about birds, turtles, horses, etc.? Gosh, I find this really funny. I'll tell you. For all the animals, there are people who know how to see the joy in any daddy. <p/> A puppy is <p/>really such a sweet companion who gets you out and about - whether you're lonely or there are too many Kittens around, you just like to go to peace for a bit. And another thing - there really is something in his eyes that you rarely find in human eyes - loyalty without selfishness, M. <p/> Well, to be fair <p/> (and not in the style of I. Gartner! ), then it has to be said that a lot of people have a dog because they ARE lonely. AND very lonely! There are too many people who are canine asocials and would rather have a dog than a human companion. There are far too many (let's say) grandmothers who don't watch their grandchildren because the children make their pet...um...nervous.....There are far too many people who prefer dogs to children.... There have been heated debates about this on some forums this year.... <p/> In short... THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE who have lost touch with reality and give a dog the love they are incapable of giving to their fellow man. <p/> But that doesn't mean that we are not normal in between.... <p/> Those of us who love dogs, but at the same time know that a dog - however we turn it - is still "" just "" an animal. .... . <p/> MM <p/> Untitled comment <p/> I knew someone who was always greeted happily by a puppy when he came home from work. he said, a little jokingly, that the puppy always made him happy, but his wife never once greeted him so happily at the door, greeting him, d <p/> auntie:) <p/> I disagree. if there's anything a single man is already missing - it's a partner. i.e. a man. but somehow I persist in believing that he's not looking for a dog, heh. because a dog can't replace a man. it can only bring him more life and depth. and that's got nothing to do with this situation. <p/> you want a dog if you like it as a creature. that's how it is when you are a child and when you grow up. the feeling of loneliness is born in the person, not in the surroundings. even married people have it sometimes. <p/> but if some unfortunate soul takes it (the dog) for that reason... the uiber has brought himself around, heh. because in that case the dog is just a means to keep himself so busy that he 'forgets' his feelings. a workaholic would then work more. gulp. self-curation and problem-solving I call it. <p/> for me, the dog has never been a means of making contact. i do just fine without it. <p/> giggles, clots:) <p/> I don't really bother about what is found in a dog and what is found in a person. both are fine with me. the dog comes to me, I like it and therefore I accept the whole package it brings. <p/> for me <p/> animals are part of life, they belong to human life, just like other people do. But it is true that it can be much more tiring to coexist with people than with animals. A human being is a bit half degenerated in our time here and now...., (puneguzitsevsegapachserjessepovsodane... ) and his psyche is fucking him up, of course, the cockroach yes... so it's really healing to socialize with animals <p/> hm, milena:) <p/> to be fair, I assume that many people have said so themselves. what I think about this, I already said in my reply to my aunt... come on, please read it, so I don't write it again. <p/> but if you feel that way about it, from your reasoning... i guess i don't need to point out that it is a labelling and / or she-said-she-said system. so far from real and fair for me. <p/> i have said many times before that i find it disingenuous to devote exclusively to animals or exclusively to humans (and not really in this post yet). and i find the not saving grandmothers with grandchildren you mention from this very title sick (and vice versa as well). it's just that you have to take the time to educate the children about the dog (some are really total antitalents) and the dog about the children. i think it's a good idea to take the time to educate the children about the dog (one is really a total antitalent) and the dog about the children. i think it's a good idea to educate the children about the dog. <p/>people who prefer dogs to children and people who prefer dogs to people are in the same basket. the difference is only in age, but it's the same. <p/> otherwise, this post is about the fact that being a dog guardian is not even close to being lonely after defolt. <p/> I love dogs. I love people. and any way you turn it - man is also ' just ' an animal. if mankind, in its self-importance, discarded all other living beings, it would breathe nothing and could only eat itself. the funny thing is that sometimes it does it without doing that. <p/> giggles, darja:) <p/> but I don't take them literally as a rule (somehow it makes sense to me that there was probably a period of falling in love, hihi). it is true, though, that we humans have this poison in us called self-importance. and then the dog's ability to be happy every time is quite charming. <p/> and you know, I didn't usually meet any guy at the door either, hehehehe... because I don't hear or smell as well as a dog. <p/> duck:) <p/> but the point this time is quite different. the point is that we should respect humans too. um. well, it's really intertwined, yes. if you respect both the animal and the human, then a respectful attitude towards the coexistence of animals and humans is quite automatic. <p/> just this one <p/> we have it too and I can't imagine not having it because it has brought such joy to everybody that it's hard to say. <p/> What I find interesting is a statement my child once made when we asked him how it is that he treats kittens and puppies differently from people, shows them all the love, in short, treats them differently from the way he used to treat people.His answer was ANIMALS HAVE NEVER NEEDED MAN BUT MORE THAN ONCE AGAIN. <p/> Hey Mermaid <p/> Yes, animals are part of life and being with man. Whether they live with you or with a neighbour. In my life I have had the opportunity to observe completely different cultures in relation to fish. Let's say in Greece. The dog strictly belongs out of the house. It is not allowed to sit on the sofa or armchair. Or bring hair and germs from outside to inside. They don't even let it near a small child. And if by chance a little furry thing wandered into the playground, the mums would scream and shout. And if the unfortunate creature had the misfortune to make a lot of noise (especially in the cities), it wasn't too hard for the neighbours to poison the dog (we had a kitten in Athens once, and I don't even know what it did to them). <p/> On the other hand, I observe the English. They are very nice to animals (well, there are extreme exceptions, but I'm speaking generally). In the army and police, dogs get decorations and titles (Sargeant, Lutenant, etc.), and there is not a house in the countryside that doesn't have two dogs. When I asked ""my"" family why they all have two dogs, they said: ""So that the fish don't get lonely... all the time, we are not and can't be with them all the time, so it's nice not to have just one animal but to have a family! ""So it's not that humans need company, but that the dog also needs company. I also meet people from other cultures who find fish ""unclean"". Yes, there are different views. Only those who really know how important fish are respect them. And now, in England, they are considering reintroducing the brown bear and the wolf, which are also native here, but have historically been exterminated. I am very interested to see how this debate ends. <p/> Grandma:) <p/> hmm... i wouldn't talk about how many of them and why they prefer a dog to a child... because i don't know any of them and i don't have one. when i try to empathise... the thing that jumps out at me the most is that it's easier to protect a dog. if you don't trust the world, the upbringing and the influences of others... it's easier to be responsible for a puppy. because you can separate it from the upbringing of a stranger. but anyway, i insist that it's not ok to turn away from people. <p/> I don't like this kind of labelling in general. i know couples who had a dog for a long time but not a child. now they have a child too. and i find it ugly and unnecessary to just compartmentalise. there is no rule what you have to have first. <p/> and I honestly don't see why anyone should be obliged to coach football instead of volleyball, or have 2 children instead of one, or go into parenthood if they don't want to (or as long as they don't want to). to please others? Why? let them live their own ideas and performances... <p/> and why should someone who doesn't want to have children - and a dog - be worse than someone who doesn't want either a child or a dog? but someone who doesn't want to have children and has fish is immaculate in everyone's eyes, or what? <p/> if someone wants to have children, let them have them, yes, in these cases it is the motives that matter. if they don't want to have children, they don't. let others have that freedom of choice, and let us stick to our own. it is a great disservice to the child to impose social pressure on the child. <p/> zuzi:) <p/> hi, it's true that they are part of life. but when it comes to living and being a neighbour, it's both direct and indirect. it's all part of life, but there are significant differences. <p/> let's say. i have a ricky. i chose to live with him, not with all the dogs of all the neighbours. the neighbours don't bother me (even when they are loud, no), but they are not so directly part of my life that i would want to pee their poo out of my garden. luckily the neighbours are so correct that it's clear to them, heh. <p/> and there are differences in societies, yes... for me, the english version is the closest. i find it very real this respect for all beings, to see not only through oneself, but also to them, for them.",Forum,train

I have thought many times about telling him but I am too ashamed because he thinks everything is ok at my house. <p/> I really don't know what to do anymore... who to turn to... because my mum and I just want to have a peaceful life. <p/> I apologise for being so rash but I was really feeling very down about this. <p/> Greetings <p/> Dear! <p/> Your situation is really not simple. Apart from the fact that your father is an alcoholic with all the attendant bad behaviour, both you and your mother are materially dependent on him. They also share a flat. <p/> Given that you are studying and are now 22 years old, you can really count on not being alone in this home for much longer, and probably for some time to come. <p/> Your mother's situation has, of course, worsened with the loss of her job. <p/> The first thing I think is important: that you see your situation as something that is transitory, that will not last forever. You will finish school and you will be able to leave, as my sister did. You will also be able to help your mother in one way or another. <p/>Now it would also not make sense for the mother to just give up, that she will not be able to earn anything more and that she will be totally dependent on the father. <p/> For your present mental distress, it is really urgent that you both seek help. I do not know what part of Slovenia you are in, but today we have groups in all the major towns and cities that could help you in this respect. Individual counselling is also possible. I enclose some addresses. <p/> This is not just about helping to get your father into treatment, but for the relatives of an alcoholic who are in need of help. <p/> And this: you have a boyfriend and you are ashamed to tell him how it is at home. I think it would be a great comfort to you to be able to share your pain with a man who means something to you and who would, of course, also have a proper understanding of it. I imagine that you will be able to share your worries with your boyfriend much more easily if you have talked about them somewhere else before. There is a very good opportunity for this in groups where relatives of alcohol addicts gather. <p/> So I would really encourage you to look for the possibility of such group and/or individual counselling. <p/> Hello, Anica <p/> AA - Alcoholics Anonymous can help you if you have found that alcohol is also a problem for you. <p/> www.aa-drustvo.si <p/> 01/433 82 25 <p/> AL-ANON - A community of family groups where family and friends of alcoholics come together.

71,"5 reasons why coworking is a great solution <p/> In Slovenia, we have recently witnessed the rise of so-called coworking offices, which allow young entrepreneurs more flexibility than working in traditional offices, and are also more affordable, which is especially important for young companies. And they have many other advantages! <p/> 5 reasons why coworking is a great solution (Image source: sxc.hu) <p/> Coworking is a great solution for young businesses,... <p/> ... because you can separate work and family more easily. <p/> Many of today's very successful entrepreneurs have started their businesses in their own homes, whether in a dusty basement or in their living room. The fact is that young entrepreneurs start out with very limited funds, so renting their own office space is usually too expensive for them. <p/> This is why renting office space in a so-called coworking office, which is especially suitable for young companies with few team members, comes into play. These offices are much more affordable than traditional offices and allow the entrepreneur to easily separate home and office space. <p/> ... because you can build a real network of friends. <p/> Coworking offices bring together several entrepreneurial teams from very different business areas in one place. By renting office space in a coworking office, you will automatically become a member of the community and you will build a real network of friends. In this way, you will spread the word about your company and make new good friends. <p/> ... because doing business can be much faster and easier. <p/> Doing business in a coworking office is not only interesting and fun, it can also be much faster and easier. Need a programmer, a designer, an accountant? Don't worry, you'll probably find one in the next room, but if you can't find one, ask the other members of the coworking office for their contact numbers and recommendations, as they've probably used the services before. <p/> ... because working in an office is much more comfortable than working in a nearby pub. <p/> Laptops and almost unlimited access to the internet allow many entrepreneurs to work from different locations. One option that many people with space problems use is to work in a café with a cup of coffee or tea. The problem arises if the owners of the café do not approve of this and the entrepreneur has to leave the place... and let's not even waste words on the effectiveness of such work. <p/> You may be comfortable working from home, but your business partners or potential clients will be much more impressed if you meet them in a tidy office instead of in a room that is also your bedroom or kitchen.

78,"Advent is a time of anticipation. Preparations for this year's Christmas are upon us. Preparation requires a certain amount of cooperation and commitment on our part. We do not wait with our arms crossed. Only children behave like that, not knowing what to do and therefore bored. If I personally want to prepare for the holiday and also get the most out of the holiday, then I have to make a programme of what I want to achieve and then work hard to really achieve the goals I have set. I will not dwell on those for whom Christmas is just a nice family holiday, when they are at home more, when they are doing the gift-giving, when they are perhaps having a Christmas holiday together on the white slopes, but we will not see them in church for the holidays because they have no faith, or because they think they have done enough by putting up a Christmas tree and an artistic nativity scene at home. I will leave aside those things that have no connection with the Christian faith and instead dwell on the Slovenian traditional Christmas celebration. What goals can I set myself in preparation for Christmas? For some, Christmas will be a time to reminisce about old times, to think about childhood and time with parents and family traditions. So they will put up the nativity scene and the Christmas tree, bless the premises in the old way, say a prayer and have a good dinner. At midnight, they will probably attend a midnight feast. It will be a really nice revival of an old tradition, and many will enjoy it. With this revival of old customs and traditions, the question that comes to my mind is: What benefit will this bring me? To what extent will these old traditions change and transform me? What will this new preparation for Christmas bring me that will make my everyday life different, richer, calmer and more meaningful? The beautiful old traditions are certainly necessary because they speak of our historical memory, which is necessary and we should not be ashamed of. Beautiful traditions are the wealth of a nation, and it is right to preserve and revive them. However, it seems to me that this will not bring into my daily life the new things that will challenge me, because they will offer me new content, because they will require me to bring into the Advent preparation for Christmas the novelties that are part of me, linked to my thinking and feeling. In this way, Christmas will no longer be just a nice old folklore, but will have a touch of the contemporary, of my personal life. Analysts have noted that man, especially Western man, and thus also Slovenian man, is increasingly losing his soul because he has allowed himself to be so drawn in by materialism that he can no longer shake it off. Materialism is like a terrible anaconda, a serpent that wraps itself around its victim and squeezes him so that he can no longer escape from its embrace. This squeezing of the serpent gets worse and worse by the moment, as it breaks the victim's bones, and in the end she suffocates, all numb. To live a more free life worthy of man, it is necessary to get out of this embrace and to put a limit to materialism. We must realise that money must not be our master, but on the contrary, we must be its master, we must put a limit to consumerism. Advent preparation for Christmas therefore consists first of all in making a careful analysis of my ordinary life. I must see clearly and evaluate my desires and expectations, but I must also be aware of my limits and my delusions. Both need to be put on the scales and to see which way the scales tip: if there are too many negative things, action needs to be taken immediately. Any delay will only lead to a growing alienation from oneself, from one's neighbours and from God. Any persistence in negative things leads to more and more dependence. At a certain point, you have to tell yourself that the time has come to get rid of all that weighs you down, takes away your freedom and harms you. It is necessary to remove all these things and say loud and clear to yourself: 'Why should I harm myself! I don't want to see this anymore! ""The strong will that is awakened by this then needs to be strengthened more every day. It is necessary to reckon with God, it is necessary to reckon with the power of prayer, and above all it is necessary to deepen faith. Only he who believes in God is then able to throw himself into God's arms, to confess his guilt and sins and to forgive first himself and then his neighbour. This is the only way we can purify ourselves and free ourselves from the past that presses us to the ground and does not let us breathe freely. We must first forgive ourselves, gain respect and trust, so that we can then forgive our neighbours and finally be reconciled to God. This is the only way to breathe more freely. Any search for any other means that does not take into account man's guilt and purify it with God's forgiveness and mercy is doomed to failure. So let us not fall for the various Internet offers that promise a quick solution. This is just a waste of money without any real effect. Why not rather cling to God, who demands no payment for Himself. His love is free, everything we receive from Him is free. Why not make the most of the opportunity that is given to us. Why not make something beautiful out of our lives that we will always be proud of and others will be richer for our change. Above all, we must remember what the prophet Jeremiah told us in the first verse: ""The days will come when I will keep my promise! ""For God keeps His covenant: what He promises, He keeps. Perhaps we do not see this in our own lives because we have not yet allowed God to come in and put our lives in order. Perhaps we have relied too much on ourselves and our own abilities, and so we do not recognise the miracles that are happening today. Perhaps we have been so tempted by money that we have bet everything on this one ticket, and so we are constantly afraid and trembling about what will happen to our savings, which have been severely depleted by the recession. Yes, we need to get rid of this fear and build our confidence on new foundations that are not destroyed by the moth. So today we set out on the road to prepare for Christmas this year. May this holiday truly be a challenge to everyone to make this Christmas different. Christ came as our Saviour to be reborn, so that we might become new people. So now is the chance for each of us to make that happen. There is no exception. For me, too, this feast is a challenge, even though things may be clearer to me in theory. Theory is not life. That is why the preparation and the celebration itself must leave an impact on our emotional sphere, on our attitude to life and to everything that surrounds us. When this happens, we will indeed look at Christmas very differently. It is certainly true that Christmas is the most romantic of all the Church festivals, but it must also bring new content to our lives. Let us therefore enter boldly into the Advent season and use it for our personal renewal and the renewal of our parish community. <p/> Contact us <p/> Spiritual reflection",Opinion/Argumentation,train
79,"Repayment of the third quarter <p/> A press conference was held today, 25 February 2014, at the premises of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport (MESS) at 16 Masarykova cesta in Ljubljana, where State Secretary Aljuš Pertinač presented the method of securing funds for the payment of salary disproportions to public institutions that fall under the auspices of the Ministry of Education. <p/> According to the State Secretary, the Ministry of Education and Science received many negative reactions to the letter prepared by the Ministry of Finance concerning the provision of funds for the payment of the first instalment, namely that each direct and indirect budget user must provide the necessary funds for the payment of the salary differential due to the elimination of the third quarter of the basic salary disproportionality within its financial plans, since the additional funds needed for the payment of this obligation must not have an impact on the increase in the budget deficit. The MoFRE took the disagreements and professional concerns to the competent authorities in the Ministry of Finance and asked for help in resolving the issue, but ""all they heard was that fiscal consolidation was continuing and that there was no money"". <p/> The State Secretary said that, in view of the fact that the funds for the payment of the obligations under the Supreme Court judgment were not provided for in the 2014 Budget of the Republic of Slovenia, and in view of the aforementioned position of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia and the Ministry of Finance, the MoEFA, after careful consideration and in full awareness of the gravity of the situation, had decided to transfer the missing funds to the public institutions that would need the Ministry's assistance in securing the funds for the payment of payment of the first instalment of the salary disproportionality compensation. The Ministry's position is that the payment of the liabilities following the judgment should not adversely affect the performance of the core activities of public education and research. <p/> In January this year, the Ministry sent a letter to the indirect budget users under its responsibility stating that each indirect budget user in the field of activity of our Ministry should, as a rule, provide itself with the necessary funds for the payment of the first instalment of the salary difference, within the limits of the institution's available resources from previous years and the resources available for the implementation of the activities in 2014. Exceptionally, if a public institution demonstrates that it is unable to provide the funds to make the first instalment of the salary differential due to the abolition of the third quarter of the basic salary disparities, the Ministry should provide the additional funds. <p/> The Ministry assessed the institutions' applications for funds to pay the third quarter of the salary disproportionality according to uniform criteria, taking into account the estimated surplus of revenue over expenditure or expenditure over revenue as at 31.12.2013, taking into account the expenditure on the third quarter of the salary disproportionality for the period from 1.10.2010 to 31.7.2011. The Ministry co-finances applications from institutions up to an amount that covers the estimated deficit of expenditure over revenue as at 31.12.2013. In addition, according to Aljuš Pertinač, the Ministry also took into account the liquidity criterion and examined the balance of cash, bank credits and short-term financial investments as at 31.12.2013 in relation to the amount of the first instalment liability. <p/> For a full explanation of the criteria according to which the MoEFCC assessed the institutions' applications, please watch the video of the press conference below. <p/> Your comment:",News/Reporting,train

84,"Anaemia is a dangerous companion to cancer <p/> General fatigue, weakness, poor concentration, depression, shortness of breath even with slight exertion, palpitations or a pounding sensation in the chest, retention of fluid in the body with the appearance of swelling, poor digestion and circulation all have a common denominator in cancer patients - anaemia. Anaemia, as anaemia may also be called, is not necessarily a consequence of cancer or its treatment, but can also be caused by a number of other, less serious, causes. However, it is often a poor blood count, with a reduced number of red blood cells (erythrocytes), which are responsible for ""transporting"" oxygen around the body to all cells, that can significantly worsen the life of cancer patients. <p/> The problems are particularly evident in blood and haematopoietic cancers, where anaemia ""comes with the territory"" of the disease. In some other cancers, however, anaemia occurs later, as a result of treatment of the cancer with chemotherapy and/or ionising radiation. One form of blood cancer is disseminated plasmacytoma, in which cancerous plasmacytoma cells grow in the red bone marrow of the flat bones, which is also the main site of production of healthy blood cells. ""The cancer cells invade the bone marrow and do not allow the healthy blood cells to develop,"" explains Dr Irena Preložnik Zupan, MD, PhD, a specialist in internal medicine at the Clinical Department of Haematology. <p/> ""When we want to define anaemia more precisely, we usually use the haemoglobin concentration in the blood. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), we speak of anaemia when the haemoglobin concentration in the blood is below 120 g/L for women and below 130 g/L for men,"" explains Preložnik Zupanova. Anaemia is divided into mild, moderate and severe forms. The former is defined as a haemoglobin concentration of between 100 and 120 g/L, the latter is between 80 and 100 g/L, and below 80 g/L is the severe form of anaemia, which usually causes the most problems, especially if it is rapid onset. <p/> ""In all cancer patients, we also check the basic blood count and anaemia is virtually impossible to miss. Often, however, the milder form of anaemia in cancer patients is somewhat neglected, but the patient's well-being and quality of life can be significantly impaired as a result. The patient is already experiencing fatigue, feeling unwell, unable to do everyday things, intimacy with a partner is impaired, unable to participate in family responsibilities, etc. All these symptoms can be present even in mild forms of anaemia,"" she warns. <p/> The causes of anaemia in cancer patients can be divided into three groups: <p/> (1) related to the cancer, where there is significant bone marrow involvement, <p/> (2) due to the treatment of the cancer with chemotherapy and/or radiation, as well as surgery, which can lead to blood loss, <p/> (3) and (4) a third group of causes can be associated diseases that the cancer patient has and, of course, also have an additional impact on the anaemia. <p/> ""If the heart is failing, we have poor blood circulation, if the lungs are diseased, there is insufficient oxygen supply, if the kidneys are not functioning well, toxic substances accumulate in the body and the organism is weakened,"" says Preložnik Zupanova. <p/> ""Cancer-related fatigue is a common phenomenon - a strange, constant feeling of general, severe tiredness, listlessness and helplessness, which cancer patients themselves attach much more importance to than doctors,"" explains Preložnik Zupanova, explaining the difference between the patient's and the doctor's perception of the problem. ""Also very important are the data showing the reduced success of cancer treatment in anaemic patients and the reduced survival of these patients compared to non-anaemic patients, irrespective of the type of cancer. "" <p/> And how common is anaemia in cancer patients? <p/> ""Based on the large 2001-2002 European Cancer Anemia Survey (ECAS) study of around 15,000 cancer patients, which looked at the incidence, prevalence and treatment of anaemia, anaemia was present in an average of 40% of patients at the time of enrolment, and in disseminated plasmacytoma, anaemia was present in two-thirds of patients at diagnosis. With cancer treatment, anaemia occurred in a further 30%"", says Preložnik Zupanova. <p/> Anaemia in cancer patients can be treated in several ways, depending on the cause. ""If a patient has severe problems due to anaemia, in terms of dyspnoea (breathing difficulties) or chest pain (a sign of ischaemic heart disease), we need to intervene with transfusions of concentrated red blood cells, which have an immediate effect. Usually these are patients with a severe degree of anaemia, haemoglobin concentration below 80 g/L. However, problems may occur earlier if the patient has associated heart or lung disease. Transfusion is also needed in patients who are actively bleeding due to cancer or if a previous attempt at erythropoietin treatment has been ineffective. In patients with mild and moderate anaemia, however, we prefer to treat with recombinant erythropoietins. The disadvantage is that it takes time for the haemoglobin concentration to rise, but it certainly avoids many of the disadvantages of transfusion,"" explains Zupanova. <p/> ""Studies are still ongoing to determine at which haemoglobin level it is best to start treating the patient, with what doses of erythropoietin and how often. In our hospital, we treat with erythropoietin when the haemoglobin concentration is below 110 g/L and administer it up to a target haemoglobin concentration of 130 g/L. At higher haemoglobin concentrations, side-effects such as thrombosis and arterial hypertension may occur. This in turn may put the patient at risk. ""Erythropoietins have a number of advantages over transfusions. The latter still pose a low risk of transmitting infections, cause iron to accumulate in the body and increase fluid volume. Immune reactions after transfusion can also be dangerous. The patient should receive a transfusion of concentrated erythrocytes in hospital for observation and appropriate management if problems arise. When treated with erythropoietins, these problems are avoided. The drug is usually in syringes for subcutaneous administration. Patients should be followed up regularly every four weeks to see how well the treatment is working. We are usually successful in patients who need the drug temporarily because of chemotherapy,"" explains Preložnik Zupanova. ""If we have a patient with advanced cancer, we mainly opt for transfusions of concentrated erythrocytes, as erythropoietins are ineffective in this case. """,Information/Explanation,train

90,"Partition walls <p/> It often happens that when building a new residential building, we overlook a flaw in the construction plan or a wall cannot be built as planned. In such cases, partition walls can be the solution. They are also often used in commercial premises to enclose individual employees and give them a little privacy in their own little ""office"". They are a quick and inexpensive solution. They achieve good acoustic and thermal performance. <p/> Partition walls are constructed with a substructure, which can be wood or metal, on which plasterboard panels are installed. There are a large number of plasterboard suppliers that also offer water-resistant plasterboards. Such panels are used for bathrooms and other wet areas. For better strength, the wall should be covered with one to three layers of plasterboard. Stone wool is inserted into the substructure to provide better insulation. All plumbing and electrical installations can also be installed in the partition walls without being visible from the outside. Installing a partition is a completely dry job, which can be done even when the building is occupied. We can also install in partition walls anything we install in normal brickwork.

93,"In a logistic sense, a ""rare disease"" - e.g. operable childhood epilepsy - is an enormous challenge for the health service of a small country, which has to provide the highest quality treatment in centres that have the experience to do the job - and these can only be developed in settings with sufficient referrals, i.e. abroad. Slovenia is too small for it to be professionally and economically rational to develop specialised teams for all complex diagnostic procedures and surgical treatment of childhood epilepsy. The prerequisite of ""at least 25 operations per year"" (and, at the same time, a steady stream of intensive diagnostic treatments) is not achievable in such a small population, and we are therefore urgently dependent on collaborative action in international networks. Of course, if there is no national support for more enterprising ideas and real support for an organisation to disseminate its own knowledge and work for patients in a more grey region. Patients in the region are interested, they come to Slovenia for other opinions and advice. But it has long been the case that in Slovenia, the health policy has never supported the views of the Syrians, not even when it was about the big and world-renowned names (neurosurgery). Today, staffing is barely sufficient to prepare our patients, who are rightly sent abroad for further treatment. The profession has never had the support of management in this either. Where are we if we wanted to offer this to the wider region? <p/> It would be very wrong, in a time of 'austerity' in a time of global financial crisis, to start applying restrictions to those patients who are most vulnerable and in whom it is reasonable to expect a major improvement in health. It would be very wrong for the recently launched public debate (e.g. by Spomenka Hribar, certainly well intentioned) to be based on bad publicity. <p/> The fact that carefully selected children with epilepsy go for treatment to the best foreign centres is, in fact, also proof of the quality of our health care. Nasa's reflections on the theme 'to be or not to be ... an orphan' have also been well received in international circles, particularly in Scandinavia.

Real doubled their advantage in the 31st minute when Karim Benzema headed home after a precise cross from the right by Gareth Bale. It was the Welshman's third assist in the last two games and the Frenchman's third goal in four days. The visitors gave the home side a real lesson in finishing, although the Whites could have gone further ahead after the first half after Real had two more good chances. Cristiano Ronaldo tried a volley in the 44th minute after a pass from Di Maria but his shot went wide of the post, while Carvajal's header was also just missed by inches by the Ruben goalkeeper. <p/> The second half, in which Illarra replaced Xabi Alonso, who is making his comeback from a long-term injury, continued in the same way as the first, with a Real Madrid goal. In the fourth minute of the second half, Bale was at it again, winning the ball on the right, breaking into the middle and passing to Ronaldo, who scored his second goal of the game to make it 3-0. It was Cristiano Ronaldo's 13th goal in La Liga this season, making him the top scorer in the Spanish championship. After a big lead for Carlo Ancelotti's charges, everything looked like a peaceful ending, but the hosts came completely close just two minutes apart. After clumsy interventions from Pepe and Marcelo, head referee Alfonso Alvarez Iquierdo twice pointed to the harshest penalty. Jonathan Viera was the better of the two in his duel with goalkeeper Diego Lopez. The home team gained confidence after scoring twice, and it was Diego Lopez who had to prove his worth in the 65th minute when he masterfully stopped a shot by Alberto Bueno. The hosts chased the equaliser until the end of the match, and on the other side Real had a couple of chances to score their fourth goal of the game, including two more attempts from Ronaldo that were saved by the Raya goalkeeper, but the score remained 2-3 and Real's ninth victory in the Spanish championship this season.",News/Reporting,train

134,"Do not leave children in the car! <p/> How many times have you been out on a trip alone with your child, and on the way you casually remembered that you had to go to the bank or the post office, and left your child waiting in the car because it was a really short errand? <p/> Although you may not have thought about it at the time, you should know that leaving children in the car can be extremely dangerous, not only in summer but also at all other times of the year. Do you want to know why? <p/> The sun heats the sheet metal <p/> Children are much more sensitive to heat than adults, which is especially dangerous in summer if you park your car in the sun. The inside of a car can heat up to 50 degrees Celsius or more in about 15 minutes, which can cause heat stroke in children. As well as the temperature itself, it is also important how the child is dressed and how old they are. The younger the child and the darker the colour of the car, the greater the risk. Conversely, the older the child is, the more easily he or she can withstand the heat, and the more likely you are to give him or her certain things, tell him or her to drink water and so on. And if you thought that a slightly open window was enough, you were wrong, because it doesn't make any difference. <p/> Villains at work <p/> It's not just the heat that can be dangerous for a child. Parents often leave the keys in the car when we have to run ""quick errands"", either because we leave the air conditioning on, the radio on, or because we're going to be ""back quickly"" anyway. In this case, although the child may not be hot in the car, the dangers are no less. However impossible and remote kidnapping may seem to us, the fact is that these crimes do not only take place abroad and on the cinema screen, but are, unfortunately, all too common in this country too. It also happens more than once that the villain is distracted by a car and, because he is in a hurry, he takes us both away. <p/> Young explorers <p/> Whether the car is exposed to the sun, whether we have left the keys in it or not, one thing is certain - children love to explore. Especially what they are forbidden to do in the presence of their parents. Of course, this depends on the age of the children - a baby is not interested in such things - but slightly older children are usually eager for the chance to satisfy their curiosity. Since we parents don't usually let them press buttons of all colours and shapes, play with levers, press pedals and turn steering wheels, they take advantage of our absence. They are too young to be aware of the dangers involved, so it is up to parents to take care of them. However short the task, you will probably agree that it is never, but never really, important enough to be worth the risk! <p/> Projects and actions",Opinion/Argumentation,train

136,"Nicotine addiction <p/> Nicotine addiction is a complex phenomenon that depends primarily on the absorption and metabolism of nicotine. In addition to sociological factors, our genetic make-up has a particularly important influence, as it can explain more than 50 % of the total risk of nicotine dependence. <p/> Scientists are discovering new genes with smaller effects alongside the well-known genes with large effects, such as CHRNA3, which have contributed significantly to understanding the biological mechanism of addiction. Nicotine acts on the acetylcholine receptor family in the brain because it is structurally similar to the brain chemical carrier acetylcholine. Binding of nicotine to such a receptor triggers the opening of ion channels on the cell membrane and the release of new neurotransmitters in the brain that induce feelings of pleasure. Chronic exposure to nicotine causes changes in the receptors, which can become less sensitive or even inactive. Changes also occur in the metabolism of nerve cells. All these changes can cause a smoker to fall into a withdrawal crisis when he or she stops smoking. <p/> More details on nicotine dependence <p/> Add to these facts the link between smoking and heart attack, lung disease and cancers of the tongue, throat and lungs, and you have enough reasons to quit. However, this is often where a major problem arises. The World Health Organisation estimates that less than 5% of people who have tried to quit smoking unaided persist one year after their last cigarette. This is due to nicotine dependence influenced by genetic factors. <p/> Nicotine dependence is a complex phenomenon that depends, among other things, on nicotine absorption and metabolism. Different people react very differently to the same amount of nicotine, which is determined by genetic factors. They can explain more than 50 of the risks of nicotine dependence. Scientists are discovering new genes to further explain the causes of nicotine dependence, which could go a long way towards solving the problem of addiction. <p/> Understanding the biological mechanism of addiction has made a significant contribution to the search for genes that might influence nicotine dependence.

However, if you do not intend to buy such a system, it is a good idea to check the soil moisture before watering the grass.

You also don't need to water the grass if it has rained for a long time, as the moisture has been retained in the soil. <p/> The best time to water the grass is early in the morning or in the evening, as this reduces the evaporation value.

156,"Beatification of the Drin Martyrs in Sarajevo <p/> 28 September 2011 at 10:11 <p/> On Saturday, 24 September 2011, five Drin Martyrs, religious of the Daughters of Divine Love, were beatified in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the ceremony, presided over by Card. Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, was attended by some 18,000 faithful. The faithful from Slovenia also made the pilgrimage to the beatification in 13 buses. Among the five new martyrs are two Slovene women from Dolenjska, Sr M. Krizina Bojanc and Sr M. Antonija Fabjan. <p/> The journey of the Daughters of Divine Love from Pal via Romagna to Goražde took four days and four nights. They arrived in Goražde on the afternoon of 15 December 1941. They were placed on the second floor of the barracks. That same evening, wild and drunken Chetniks broke into their room and tried to kill them. In defence of their human dignity and their promise of chastity, the sisters broke free from the hands of their attackers and jumped out of the window one by one. Meanwhile, the Chetniks broke down in front of the barracks and executed the severely wounded sisters with knives. They were dragged to the river Drina, which carried their bodies away a few days later. S.M. Berchmana stayed in Sjetlina for ten days, where she recovered quite well. Then she was to go to Goražde, to the other sisters, who were already dead. Two Chetniks took her away on a sledge. When he returned, the coachman said that she had arrived safely at her sisters' home. The attendant, however, had a rosary around her neck. It is recorded that she was killed on 23 December 1941. Sisters Jula, Berchmana, Krizina, Antonija and Bernadeta, known as the ""Drin Martyrs"", served God generously and with selfless love, as missionaries in the ""afflicted Bosnia"", especially by helping the poor. They confirmed their fidelity to God by shedding their blood. <p/> Word of their martyrdom spread far and wide. Therefore, on 4 December 1999, Cardinal Vinko Puljić, Archbishop of Vrbas, after having obtained the necessary permission from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, issued a decree to begin the diocesan process for their beatification. The beatification of the Servants of God Sr. M. Jule Ivanišević and the four sisters is not only an official recognition of their martyrdom, but also a high recognition of the spiritual values for which the sisters lived and sacrificed their lives. Jula Ivanišević, Berchmana Leidenix, Krizina Bojanc, Antonija Fabjan and Bernadeta Banja are witnesses to an extraordinary fidelity to God and an active love for the poor. In faith, we rightly hope that their shed blood will be the seed of new Christians who are aware and responsible, and of new spiritual vocations for new times. Martyrs are strong intercessors in every need, especially in the difficult trials and dangers of life. Many have already seen this. <p/> Blessed Sr. Marija Krizina Bojanc, baptised Jozefa, a nun and martyr, was born on 14 May 1885 in Šmarjeta, Dolenjska. At the age of 36, she entered the religious community of the Daughters of Divine Love in Sarajevo. Full of sisterly love, she was distinguished for her constant prayer, sacrifice and penitential life. During her lifetime she was called ""Sister of Prayer"". She crowned her life in fidelity to Christ when, on 15 December 1941, she gave her life rather than renounce her vows and Christ. Her martyr's blood is clear proof that she loved God more than she loved her own life. <p/> Blessed Sr. Marija Antonija Fabjan, also baptised Joseph, a nun and a martyr, was born on 23 January 1907 in Mali Lipje in the parish of Žužemberk. At the age of 22, she entered the religious community of the Daughters of Divine Love in Sarajevo and made her vows on 19 March 1932. She was distinguished for her simplicity, sincerity, piety and self-control. Faithful to her religious vocation, she was tortured and killed on 15 December 1941, together with four other sisters. Out of love for Christ, she accepted martyrdom so that ""the life of Jesus might be made manifest in her mortal body"" (cf. 2 Cor 4:11). <p/> Both Slovenian sisters come from the diocese of Novomeč. <p/> The veneration of the Drin martyrs will take place on their death day, 15 December. <p/> The Martyrs are models of fidelity to God, of human and feminine dignity, of active love for their neighbours, and intercessors for new spiritual vocations, especially for women, as well as in the various trials of life.",Information/Explanation,train

According to statistics, more than five per cent of the population officially suffer from this eating disorder, but in reality many more do. Like anorexia, bulimia affects more women than men, up to eight times more. Unlike anorexia, a person suffering from bulimia can conceal their distress for much longer than an anorexic person, as they tend to have a normal to moderate weight gain. The BMI of anorexics is very low, while that of bulimics ranges from 20 to 25. <p/> Huge amounts of food <p/> A characteristic of bulimia is repeated overeating, which occurs over a very short period of time. During this time, the person eats huge amounts of food, changing all the flavours from sweet, bitter, salty, sour... When he overeats, he feels guilty and induces his own vomiting, often with the help of laxatives and diuretics. Overeating and vomiting are cyclical, recurring several times a week. Most people who suffer from bulimia (75 %) belong to the so-called purgative type, which is characterised by overeating, vomiting and laxative use. The non-purgative type (25 per cent), on the other hand, indulges in fasting and excessive physical activity after binge eating. In bulimia, the person cannot control himself or herself, and therefore cannot choose the appropriate amount and type of food. However, it should be noted that most people who are overweight do not suffer from bulimia.",Information/Explanation,train

The focus will be on support for grassroots sport and on tackling cross-border threats to sport. These include doping, match-fixing and violence. Education and training will receive the largest share of Erasmus+ funding (77.5%). <p/> Slovenia will receive €13.65 million of decentralised funding under Erasmus+ in 2014, Education Minister Jernej Pikalo explained in Brussels. The European Commission is already working with EU Member States to prepare for the publication of the 2014 Pre-Bid, which is expected in December and will be very important for us, he stressed. <p/> When the European Commission publishes calls for tenders for funding, it is often not very easy to choose what it actually wants, what it will fund.

Young people who want to get European funding in the fields of education, training, culture can use Eve's electronic online platform to find out about the projects it has already selected. It also provides project promoters' experiences, documents and guidelines, as well as information on organisations looking for partners to collaborate on various European projects.

In 2009, more than 50% of those who voted in the European Parliament elections were aged 55 and over, while the proportion of young voters aged 18-24 was only 29%, meaning that MEPs are mostly representatives of older people and therefore young people are disadvantaged when it comes to representing their interests, according to the study. <p/> EU citizens have the right to work without a work permit in all EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Norway.

181,"Still a storm in no man's land <p/> Monday, 10 October, marked the ninety-first year since the Carinthians chose their country in a plebiscite. In the choice between the foreign Austria they knew and the native, Slavic Kingdom of SHS they did not, the former prevailed. Although they had won a country, their homeland was increasingly under threat. The struggle of the Carinthian partisans for their mother tongue, forests and justice has recently been the subject of two recent works by Maja Haderlap and Peter Handke. <p/> The Angel of Forgetting (Engel des Vergessens), a novel by Haderlap, was awarded one of the most important prizes in the German-speaking world, the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize, and Handke's work Still the Storm (Immer noch Sturm), which was awarded the Austrian Nestroy Theatre Prize for the best play of 2011, had its premiere at the Burgtheater in Vienna at the beginning of October, following its premiere at the Salzburg Gala Games and its premiere at the Thalia Theatre in Hamburg. Between autobiography and historical testimony, Maja Haderlap's novelistic debut tells the story of her ancestors from Lepen near Železná kapla, centring on her grandmother, who survived the torture of the Ravensbrück women's concentration camp (""She saved herself, yes, but if that is why she prefers to live, she doesn't know. ""), and his father, who fled to the partisans at the age of 12 after the Nazi torture that marked his life forever (""I would rather forget everything. ""). The first-person narrator, me, changes as the narrative unfolds from a girl who is still learning basic concepts, like, for example, the partisans, to a woman torn between her home environment and the world, Slovenian and German, the stage and reality and, most importantly, the past and the present. The story thus grows from simple descriptions of the domestic environment, family relationships and children's ideas of the world into a document of time, filled with a historico-political charge, which testifies to the relations between the Slovenian minority and the Austrian majority, to the forgotten, ignored and scorned partisan resistance, and to the shadows that the past casts over the divided Carinthian families of the present. That I always, regardless of age, tells its story in the present tense, in some places causing blurred transitions between the past and the present, but at the same time emphasising being trapped in time and showing how far into the past we have to reach in order to shed light on the present. The Constant Self also drifts into an overly direct autobiography on a few occasions, which, while intimately convincing the reader that the story being told is true, also strips away a bit of objectivity from the overall historical testimony. Otherwise, The Angel of Forgetting goes beyond testimony, and in some places even turns into poetry, a language of powerful images that is the antipode to the simple, clear and pure narrative tone. <p/> The Snows of History Still Storming, arguably Handke's most personal work to date, was to have been put on the stage of Vienna's Burgtheater as a guest performance by Handke's friend Claus Peymann, but a falling out broke out between the director and the playwright, and they broke off their collaboration. Handke then decided to publish the play as a book (by the German publishing house Suhrkamp) and left the direction to the Bulgarian-born director Dimitri Gotscheff (whose production of Aeschylus' The Persians was seen as a guest performance at Cankarjev dom in 2010) for the Salzburg Festival Games. Handke entrusted the Bulgarian director with an understanding of the Slavic soul and the tragedy of losing one's homeland, but he also wanted the director not to leave out much of the text and thus create a multi-hour play comparable to Über die Dörfer (Across the Village), directed by Wim Wenders for the Salzburg Festival in 1982. Gotscheff succeeded in putting on stage one of Handke's most powerful texts, which the author himself called a jaloig about the Carinthian revolt and the history of my family. The text, in which there are no clearly identified persons and their replicas, but also no didascalia, resembles a novel in dialogue rather than a dramatic work, moving between languages (choral German, Carinthian dialect and Slovene) and genres (lyric, epic, drama). The central narrator and observer is himself (an excellent performance by Jens Harzer), surrounded by his (dead) ancestors in the Carinthian foothills of Austria: his grandparents, his mother and her three brothers (Gregor, Valentin, Benjamin) and his sister (Ursula). Jaz's perspective resembles the view from the cradle of an elderly (blue) baby, asking, reporting and commenting, but sometimes it seems as if he is not there at all, or as if the whole action is taking place in his half-sleep. That it is just a nightmare that he doesn't know whether it is happening inside him or outside him, whether he is crawling inside it or being attacked by it (""Not that I leave you alone. Don't leave me alone, be still. You do not leave me alone, no and no. ""). I follows a family tragedy: the deaths of the (forcibly conscripted) Wehrmacht soldiers Benjamin and Valentin, and then the death of the (at first delighted and then disappointed) partisan Ursula (with the partisan name Snežena). The only son who returns to the family is Handke's uncle, the partisan Gregor. Gregor, whom Handke portrayed (though always differently) in several of his works, studied fruit-growing in Maribor and wrote a book on apple varieties, which the family on stage reads as a Bible (in Slovenian), but the product of his uncle Gregor, who was actually killed as a soldier in the Wehrmacht, is also supposed to have a special place in Handke's real life. The stage is completely empty and bare, the costumes do not change, there are hardly any props. There is a void, filled with words of rage and frustration, sadness and suffering. Words about the language the family wanted to save (""To save a language is to save a soul. ""), about the homeland it wanted to preserve (""To lose the homeland once, to lose the homeland forever. ""), and about the history it wanted to write (""History, it has swallowed up my life and our life, the feeling of life. ""). During the four-hour-long speech, green confetti keeps falling on the stage, fast or slow. History snows, slowly covering space, time and performers. <p/> Home, Church, Politics, History, Language and Self Maja Haderlap and Peter Handke build their texts in different narrative tones: she calmly and occasionally confessional, he wildly and preachily. She is drawn to sentiment and he to irony, we sense in her the fusion of words and landscape and in him their incompatibility. But the motifs that merge into the narrative flow remain the same. The house as the point of contact and the most important space for the whole family. Politics, which those who have been most deeply disappointed avoid in the greatest arc. A dream in which the past and the present are intertwined. A Church that has thrown away its own children because they have taken up the fight for the language in which its priests preached before the war. And last but not least, there is the point of contact with me, a person who was born too late to live, yet will never escape. Both writers feel the pain of politics devouring history and history devouring their own children (""They know that their past does not appear in Austrian history books, still less in those of Carinthia, where the history of the country begins with the end of the First World War, pauses and continues with the end of the Second World War. ""The Austrian post-war statehood was founded (among other things) on the resistance of the Carinthian Slovenians, on the blood sacrifice in the local forests and orchards, and then was sucked into the black hole of history. (""A country that does not want us, and it is because of us that it is allowed to exist as a state..."") One of the strongest motifs of both narrators is language - in Handke's case, it is the fear of its loss that is stronger, and the hope for its salvation or at least its recognition (""Our language, our strength. Beyond language, violence erupts. "", ""Language, mine, ours: the hen's ladder will be Jacob's ladder.""), while in Haderlap's case it is a more intimate search for one's own identity (""I hope that later I will find or invent the right language... "", ""Who am I, who do I belong to, why do I write Slovenian and speak German? ""The two narratives, which take place on the periphery of our territory, are not just a matter of province. Just as much as they are a matter for Austria because of its suppressed history, they are also a matter for central Slovenia, which most often does not hear the voices from the periphery. At the Burgtheater in Vienna, a section of the audience gave the production of Still the Storm a standing ovation, and there were shouts of enthusiasm from the boxes. Many audiences attend Maya Haderlap's many Austrian readings. When will the subtle stories from the periphery touch all Slovenian viewers and readers, and when will we begin to see their past as our own? The Slovenian translation of Handke's text (published by Wieser, translated by Brane Čop, reviewed by Florjan Lipuš and Peter Handke) will be available in the second half of November, while Maja Haderlap's novel will be published in Slovenian next summer (by Litera). <p/>Quotes",Opinion/Argumentation,train

191,"Television colloborations <p/> About a year and a half ago, Slovenia switched from analogue to digital TV reception. Quite a lot of people started to wonder what this would bring us and what it meant for our continued viewing of TV channels. The answer was very simple, because it was all due to the switchover to a newer technology, which, while it brings considerable improvements in terms of the picture and sound itself, before the switchover it was, in principle, more of a problem for the majority of the population. This difficulty meant either buying a converter or a new television that supports DVB-T. On this account, 2010 was quite a successful year for the sellers of this type of equipment, because monitoring programmes via an analogue signal was no longer possible afterwards, but I also think that both the Internet subs and the providers of other types of monitoring of TV channels were satisfied, because certainly not a few people opted for such a changeover. Eventually, the situation calmed down and it stopped being talked about, because things stood as they should. Well, yes, until it got complicated and a bit more serious. <p/> Earlier this year, Norkring ceased operating multiplex B (which they won the tender for), which contained TV3 and Pink Si, and the main purpose of the multiplex itself is to broadcast commercial programmes. Nevertheless, there were a number of other programmes that were licensed to be broadcast, but we did not see them during Norkring's management of multiplex B. Multiplex A, which is operated by Radio Television Slovenia, currently also broadcasts commercial programmes, even though it is intended only for national programmes. Thus, Slovenia has only one functioning multiplex, which contains both national and commercial programmes, and space for additional ones is running out. Since June, TV Slovenia's channels 1 and 2 have also been available in high definition (HD), but they can only be viewed by IPTV and cable TV users, and the switch to digital transmission has lost its significance, as HD viewing is not possible for viewers who watch the programmes via antennas. Instead, there are now four commercial channels in multiplex A, three of which - POP TV, Kanal A and Vaš kanal - have been there since the beginning, and were joined by Pink Si after the departure of Norkring. The multiplexes are now what they are, because the commercial channels will be in multiplex A until someone starts operating multiplex B again. This could be done again by Norkring or later after a public tender by someone else (source). <p/> On the other hand, there has been talk for some time of a new commercial programme, Planet TV, to be launched by Telekom, which would be quite different from the existing ones. Its content will consist of sports, films, serials and other programmes, and finally a news programme. It would be available via cable and IP television, and also via aerial reception (source). This is where the problem arises, because there are almost no more places in multiplex A, and the call for new channels was already published at the end of last October, with Golica TV, Sponka TV and TV Nakupi meeting the conditions. As the deadline (which is not legally binding) for issuing decisions is tomorrow, this could be delayed further, mainly due to pressure from Telekom, which did not apply for the tender within the October deadline (source). <p/> My view on all this is that, despite the pressure from Telekom, decisions should be issued to the programmes that applied for the tender in October and meet the conditions, and that once multiplex B has been given an administrator, the commercial programmes should go there and, if possible, TVS 1 and TVS 2 should start broadcasting in high definition in multiplex A. As for Planet TV, I hope that it will not be a copy of the current commercial programmes, whose main schedule is just commercials.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
192,"Comedy was part of the state apparatus and should be interpreted as an important institution of Athenian democracy. It was a joyful assembly, since the citizens were also the audience. Through comedy they celebrated themselves, i.e. the rule of the people. Since it is a joyful assembly, comedy must be defined as political. The people identified with the comic hero who, as a mediocre, triumphs against society and attacks the highest authorities (leading politicians, influencers, priests, gods) in the name of the people. <p/> Ambitious, sensuous, full of striking characters, panoramic descriptions and dramatic plots, Tibetan writer Alai's short story ""The Red Poppy"" opens a window on pre-occupation Tibet. Set in the 1930s, it describes the rise and, at the same time, the decline of a wealthy family of a powerful chieftain, his Chinese wife, his first son and heir, and his second "" idiot "" son, who is also the story's narrator and its unsung hero. <p/> The international symposium took place on 12 November 2010 at the Museum of Žiri, on the very day of the signing of the Treaty of Rappal 90 years ago, which severely affected the lives of many Slovenians. Its legacy was lived by our ancestors and is still being lived today. <p/> Europeans, open this book, step inside it. After a few steps in the darkness, you will see strangers sitting around a fire, come closer, listen: they speak of the fate they have meted out to your shops and the mercenaries who guard them. They may notice you, but they will keep on talking, and not even quietly. <p/> Most people here think of an overpopulated, poor, third-world country when they think of India. The Orientalist view that the Indian subcontinent is overpopulated and poor contains a not very hidden subtext about the cavalier relationship between the two: they are poor because there are too many of them, and they will remain poor as long as there are so many of them. <p/> Since the 13th century, municipal statutes have been the constitution and code of the municipalities along the Adriatic Sea.

In addition, yoghurt contains twice as much protein as milk, which our bodies need to function properly. <p/> 2. If our digestive system is healthy, it will absorb all the vitamins, minerals and other substances it needs from food.

Yoghurt is one of the foods that has the most positive effect on our digestion, so make sure you include it regularly in your diet. <p/> 3. Yoghurt also boosts the immune system as it contains cultures of living organisms. These boost our body's defences, so when we are stressed or it is cold outside, we should eat yoghurt to protect our bodies against illness. <p/> 4.

In an era where modern technology is reducing the impact of many forms of media advertising, promotional products are becoming increasingly important for reaching new customers. <p/> Why promotional products are still effective Retailers are increasingly using promotional products to attract new customers because of their usefulness. Television, as an advertising medium, is increasingly under threat with the rise of new TV channels, and it is easy for viewers to skip adverts. In the case of a promotional product, the advertisement cannot be skipped, as it is part of the product and is visible whenever the product is used. <p/> Promotional product manufacturing on the rise Today, promotional product manufacturing is booming because it offers advertisers what many other advertising methods do not, i.e. your message is guaranteed to reach the desired population. Despite the many messages we bombard our potential customers with, advertising with promotional products is effective because many of the messages are internalised. For a message to be internalised by customers, it needs to be repeated many times. A promotional product with its own message is the ideal way to achieve this. <p/> Targeting and measurability Internet advertising makes it easy to reach your target audience and monitor the impact of your advertising campaign. We can do the same with the right promotional product. For example, we print a unique promotional code on the promotional product, which then helps us calculate how much we have recouped our investment. <p/> Promotional products as part of your promotional plan Promotional products will continue to be just one part of your marketing plan, but they play a very important role and should not be overlooked. Promotional products are a great way to make a service tangible and achieve brand awareness through constant messaging. <p/> UK - A 2011 survey by The British Promotional Merchandise Association (BPMA) showed that marketers much prefer to buy practical promotional products that have been proven to be good and effective in the past. These Top 3 products include pens, notepads and post-it notes, and canvas shopping bags or ECO bags. <p/> When asked how they get the promotional products they want, almost 70 respondents said that the supplier they currently work with is a key source of information. <p/> Despite the fact that more and more money is being spent on marketing, more and more companies want newer and more original ways of promotion to differentiate themselves from the rest. Products made from environmentally friendly materials have become increasingly important in recent years. Eco promotional products not only increase sales and brand awareness, but also communicate what kind of company you are. <p/> Read the full article on the new eco-guidelines that the promotional products industry is following at www.ppiblog.com.",Promotion,train

He finally chose his career as a writer in 1996 and has since been teaching guitar on a part-time basis at the Comunità degli Italiani ""Giuseppe Tartini"" di Pirano (Community of Italians ""Giuseppe Tartini"" of Pirano). In 2002 he became a member of the Association of Primorska Literary Writers. In 2003 he obtained the status of a self-employed writer in culture. <p/> He writes for children and adults. In collaboration with the academic painter Fulvia Zudič, he has published the picture books Citronček in Giovanin, Mesto 2000 and Tonin. All three are multilingual. The first was awarded the 3rd International Competition for Original Illustrated Fairy Tales in Bordano, Italy (1999). Tonin was selected by the Internationale Jugendbibliothek in Munich as one of the best international children's and young people's books in 2010, and was included in the exhibition and catalogue. Tonin's picture book was thus awarded the prestigious title/prize The White Ravens 2010. He has also written the plays The Three Little Donkeys and Rosie the Shrimp and Lučka and the Most Beautiful Gift for children. Both have had several stage productions and have toured at home and abroad. <p/> He first captivated adults with his collection of short stories, Sailors' Bathing in Warm Water. This was followed by the novels The Boat and The Writer, Adam and the Pilot, then the short stories in the book The Sky of a Long Summer, the novel Journey to the Beginning of the Road and the short stories collected under the title Four Sea Miles. <p/> The publication of Pegan's books never goes unnoticed by readers, reviewers and literary critics. He put Piran and the Slovenian sea on the Slovenian literary map. ""With Pegan's fiction, the sea and the seaside town enter Slovenian literature as never before"". (Tucovič V., 2010) ""His writing style is subtle, incisive and confessional, or in other words, Vanja's writing is colourful, melodic and poetic. What he feels, he can articulate. He is a master of describing details and interesting phrases, of interweaving past and present, of nostalgia and optimism. Reading his works carefully, one cannot fail to notice his subtle criticism of the absurd values of today's society and his awareness that we need something more than mere materialism and consumerism to live a meaningful life."" (Petaros Kmetec K., Juh M., 2012) <p/> He has published in various literary magazines. Since 2009, Vanja Pegan has been the president and co-founder of the literary association and publishing house Društvo Knjižni krog.",Information/Explanation,train

213,"After two Mondays in a row what I promised myself not to get out of my head happened, I had to load too much and too little into my phone, into the target and past it, especially for you, instead of having a good read of the 5200 characters of a meaningful and concise summary, this time, just in case, I am starting to write on Sunday, 30. January at 7:15 pm at the ICSMC Office while an all-day meeting of anarchists is going on in the hall, who have asked me not to publish their photos because violent Nazis are searching for their faces on the web. <p/> The Carnian Outlaws are still retreating from the Cultural Pool after ten years of occupying this monument to the ruined social system of socialism. Behind the latter, Šulc sheds no tears. In a decisive internal document, the municipality of Kranj, and the people with names and surnames in it, judged the Pool to be a building fit for demolition, and this made the job of Gross, the representative of the land-owners, much easier. For the last two years, the Municipality has been RENTING a building built by self-managed labour from a ""generous"" representative of the entitled descendants for a large sum of money. This temporary unhealthy state of affairs has ended, the four-day over-the-top festival ""Dost mamo"" with the subtitle ""Izbruh's Last Pogo in the Swimming Pool"" has been survived by Šulc et al, and the property of the Izbruh Association is being moved to a warehouse, which, with luck, has been borrowed by a comrade. Gregor Kosi of the Bakery and I agree to convene the first meeting of the Pohorje Battalion in Kranj near Brdo and there let ourselves be irradiated by the facts and impressions of the freshly abandoned self-contained scene. In ten years of cultural struggles, at many hundreds of events, no one was killed and no one was wounded. Gregor and I are determined to drive the wedge that the Bakery Industry drove into the bottom of the Pool at the ""Slovenian Cultural Pig"" a few years ago. <p/> Franjo Frančič visited the MKSMC on Monday, bringing three books for our library that are being discarded by public libraries for lack of interest: the first is Dr. Franjo Derganec's memoir ""The Bloody Rose"", the second is Lad Ambrožić Novljan's ""March of the Fourteenth"", and the third is ""Radio Liberation Front"" by Jože Javoršek. Franjo was happy to see a good direction by Katja Peganova for his text. He was returning from Trieste where the premiere took place. He was constantly talking and hitting the nail on the head, describing today's youth as the wormy foundation of the future. He is happy that his daughter listens to Edot Maajko and he went to buy her ""Spomen ploćo"" for her birthday. <p/> On Monday, when I was ""like a sick shit"" (claims my wife Arijana) getting ready to report for four years of soft terrorism and to complete my report to the Youth Office, the top brass of the Likej Association came by, with Tonči Kuzmanić, let's say, at the head. I was unpleasantly surprised because Tonči does not see the unravelling or complication of the current issue of the municipality of Ankara as clear proof that the right and the left are united, because it is about the interests of Capital or the Port of Koper. It seems quite obvious to me that the parliamentary parties are in no hurry to comply with the will of a few thousand citizens, never mind the millions of euros that the Port of Koper brings in. Tonči has been incomprehensibly reticent in his assessment of the matter. His first reaction was that he did not know enough about the matter. <p/> On Tuesday, I met with a lover of tidiness and efficient use of time and space, Simon Kardum, at the Kino Šiška. He was accompanied by his henchman Manček, who some time ago lectured me to be ashamed of myself for putting myself at the head of the Youth Field NGO Foundation at the age of sixty. There will be nothing of Brecljevanie in Šiška, but on 9 March this year, in the cathedral, which is by no means a public cultural trough, there will be a multimedia event ""Feu Marko Brecelj"" with a performance by a second-hand singer-songwriter, video projections and performances by DPZN. The subtitle of the event is ""For the second time, for the first time at Kino Šiška"". The first time I performed there with the Bulldozers was in 1975 at the Golden M. We did a performance called ""Day of Disease"" and we called it ""Ashes and Leukaemia"". <p/> On Wednesday, during the day, we sent out the Doganetta ""Judgement in the name of the people"", and in the evening, Franci Blašković presented an excellent CD ""Kobra je u brajdi"" at the Kabina Gallery, and one with which he is not satisfied: ""Ipak je lepiej travu pušiti nego Gori uši slušati"". On the night of Wednesday to Thursday I had no choice: I plunged myself into slow and mind-numbingly weak reporting for the aforementioned reputable institutions. I smoked French cigarettes exceptionally during this effort. The substantive report for the four-year soft terrorism programme may be of interest to some. It will be published at www.dodogovor.org. <p/> On Thursday morning the MKSMC came to do electrical measurements and came across a sleepless man from Klanec. I immediately called their boss and ""dropped"" Supervisor Vid and Supervisor Samuel on him at ten o'clock. These two young members of ours described and listed in detail the oversights and negligence of his unforgettable contractors, headed by the palm buyer Danjel. That afternoon Dr Vlasta Jalušić gave a lecture on ""History, Politics, Law / Rights: Hegel"" in the MKSMC hall but unfortunately I was unable to attend due to the unavoidable financial part of the report to the Youth Office. It was super fine, I was half out of my mind. And at the end, cinema! Vid spun us the US-Argentine 35 millimeter too crime flick ""Our Father"" (""Padre nuestro""). <p/> On Friday, when I was quite euphoric from nine hours of sleep, Arijana started to sweat and immediately gave me a dramatic ultimatum. The nine formerly thick white envelopes with slips of paper, receipts, lists and now and then even notes, which had been (briefly) waiting in the top left inside pocket of my jacket for eight months to three weeks to be counted and sorted out by me, had to go immediately on the table and into the sunlight and under the magnifying glass. Some of the receipts for the June Friendship Offensive were barely legible with a magnifying glass and a good deal of imagination, and one no longer had a speck of colour on it. At the time of writing, the contents of all the envelopes have been examined three times, the worn envelopes have been replaced with new ones, and things have been tidied up and sorted out in my pocket and in my head. The anarchists left two hours ago, the kitchen is left in order, Teja and Luka have cleaned the floor! Cha, cha, cha, cha. <p/> Vid has just embedded an audio recording of Friday's meeting with the initiative groups organising the concerts on the Dodogovor website archive (Sunday, 30 January 2011 at 23:20). It's not short and it's mostly me speaking. I had so much to say about our twenty years of fighting against the wind and the reasons for the decision to freeze the DPZN co-organisation in February and March. You are welcome to listen! It is better for you if you give it up. Only then don't bring out the insulting, yellow details of my truthful and righteous sub-pedagogical fabrications. We're already at six thousand seven hundred characters, the situation is alarming, my sturdy editor Boris Vasev is looking at his watch, and there's just this: on Saturday twenty of us watched a good Jarmusch's ""Coffee and Cigarettes"", Vid was baking popcorn, and Tomi suggested a hip hop concert by the uncontrolled in the last days of February. Who are the Uncontrolled? They are Slovenian citizens without controlled origins: mainly Bosnians, blacks, American women under Triglav. I have long been urging them to come to MKSMC to prepare something, which of course Breclj with his negative karma could not manage! But 23 year old semi-controlled Tommy, the president of the ""KAM"" association, managed to do it. When we are allowed to vote in Koper, he will stand as an independent candidate. Vote for him!

215,"Today, the Minister of Culture, Majda Širca, opened the exhibition Drawing in Slovenia II 1940-2009 at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) in Zagreb, which presents the works of around 100 Slovenian artists. It is a selection of drawings from the exhibition of the same name, which was held last year at the City Gallery of Ljubljana. <p/> Drawing is one of the most daring, challenging and exciting genres within the field of art, because it confronts us with a very demanding and responsible gesture that we must not miss, a gesture that is unique and which, on the other hand, is often a matrix, a basis or a point of departure for other artistic practices, Širčeva said about the importance of drawings. These, she believes, have been lost, especially today, in the many postmodernist artistic genres. <p/> She stressed the importance of the exhibition for Slovenian art, as well as the outstanding cooperation with Croatia in the field of culture. The Croatian Minister of Culture, Bozo Biskupic, also pointed out at the opening that the Slovenian exhibition is a celebration of community and mutual understanding. He recalled that the three giants of Slovenian and European art - Zoran Mušić, Gabriel Stupica and Marij Pregelj - are a symbol of a common cultural centre, having studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb. <p/> It is the drawings of this trio that open the exhibition, said its curator and art historian Aleksandar Bassin, who said that drawing has never been a trendy exclusive. The exhibition, he said, is arranged according to the artists' ages, not their works. After the three artists mentioned, the works of selected artists follow, from sculptors and printmakers to painters of the middle generation. <p/> In the last part of the exhibition, there are young people who were born in the 1970s or 1980s, and it is they who, according to Bassin, most express the future of drawing, which is consciously and unencumbered living its full artistic life. <p/> Until 21 September, drawings created in various artistic techniques will be on display, providing both a representative insight into Slovenian artistic drawing of the last 70 years and the continuity of drawing as an independent chapter of Slovenian fine art. <p/> The Zagreb exhibition is also accompanied by a comprehensive monograph with interpretative critical commentaries on each artist.",News/Reporting,train
218,"Happy hillbillies at the Philharmonic! <p/> 09 Apr 2012 <p/> There is a lot to learn from all history, including folk-music history. There is only one aspect to this: whether the musician has something to gain from the experience of others, or whether he or she has simply stood still all his or her life. A shining example of how wide one should spread one's wings is the Veseli Hribovci ensemble from Ljubljana. <p/> Veseli hribovci was active for twenty years, led by the academically trained musician Stane Žnuderl, who was usually also the author of the music and lyrics, and who always ensured a high level of performance for those times.The ensemble was extremely popular both in Slovenia and abroad (in the German-speaking area, of course, it was called Die lustigen Bergsteiger), and it also performed in the most important Slovene cultural centres, and it was always in search of the new, the different, the original. Although the Merry Hillmen appeared on the then Radio Ljubljana only in 1959, they had already played two years earlier, but without radio ambitions. The very origins of the ensemble are interesting. They performed the operetta Na planincah naszych (On Our Mountains) at the KUD Vič in Ljubljana, for which the libretto was written by Miha Kunaver and the Veseli hribovci leader Stane Žnuderl wrote the music. When I met him a few times, he always got very angry at such memories, because he could not understand that some radio and television editors, who get their salaries from RTV subscriptions, cannot or will not listen to their listeners. But he also got angry at the idea that there was nothing wrong with local music, it just needed to be brought up to the right level. It was the quality of the music that made the Merry Hills people one of the first to appear on the radio programme Thursday Evening of Local Songs and Hymns, as guests on the first television programmes and on many radio programmes in the field. Back then, it was also the case that the editors of other programmes tried to bring the most popular groups, especially folk-entertainment groups, to the field. Žnuderl was fond of telling anyone who disparaged local music: ""We also performed at the Slovenian Philharmonic, where we - probably one of the few, if not the only ones - played no less than seven polkas and waltzes. And live, in front of the TV cameras. I myself began by whistling the entire first movement of one of my compositions, which created a real enthusiasm among the audience. ""The Merry Mountaineers were among the first to follow the Avseniks across national borders, which were still very closed at that time. In Austria, Germany and Switzerland, they always sang in Slovene. On the other hand, they were so inventive that they performed the song dedicated to the town of Kindberg in both languages and gave the notes to the mayor of the town. Although at that time we were still seen by many as part of the underdeveloped Balkans, this approach convinced everyone and opened the way forward. It is no wonder that the Merry Hillmen recorded 78 songs for German-speaking audiences. And thanks to Žnuderl, they were always among those at home who were looking for a new expression. They were probably the first to add zithers to a quintet in one of their songs, Peter Ambrož, a member of the Slovenian Octet, sang with the Veseli hribovci, and they recorded a large vinyl album with the Stari Ljubljančani, legendary singers, including the Lumbar brothers, members of what were probably the most popular radio singers of the time, the Fantje na vasi (Boys in the Village). To put it another way: Stane Žnuderl never slept on the laurels of his first successes, but always tried to add something new and original to the new ones, and the quintet itself was set up in such a way that it was recognisable from afar. The release of each of their new albums was a great event, as was each public performance. On top of that, the Veseli hribovci from Ljubljana were also good-hearted. They donated a sum that was seven times Žnuderl's professor's salary for the construction of their home in Debele Rtič. It means that all the musicians really had a good heart and that their basic mission was not - as in many cases today - just to make sure that they performed as much as possible for the sake of earning money, everything else being of secondary importance.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

In the case, lawyer Mir Senić is accused of having wrongly received a commission of €1.3 million from Vegrad. <p/> Miro Senica, an influential Ljubljana lawyer, is officially under criminal investigation and faces up to ten years in prison. The lawyer is under investigation for alleged abuse of position and money laundering in the notorious Delamaris case, in which he allegedly received €1.3 million from Vegrad, reports today's Dnevnik daily. <p/> ""In this respect, we can only stress that Mr Miro Senica is convinced that all the suspicions against him are groundless and unfounded, which will undoubtedly be revealed when the investigation is completed,"" the law firm of Mr Senica told siol.net. <p/> Senica spent money on a villa in Portorož <p/> The controversial deal allegedly took place in 2007. Vegrad from Velenje bought the Delamaris fish processing plant in Isola for €22 million. The land was to be used for the Urban Renewal Izola project. Vegrad paid a commission of 1.35 million. This ended up in the account of Bužekijan, a company led by Blanka Muster, one of Senica's colleagues. In reality, the money ended up with Senica, who used it to buy a villa in Portorož.

221,"Where did the... domestic pasture go... <p/> Who doesn't remember the sweet sixties? A period of optimism, good humour and progress in all fields, every day. I'm thinking from a purely consumerist point of view, post festum of course, because like most of you I wasn't born yet. But with all these revivals and golden memories, I have utopically recalled that time when mass consumption went the other way. <p/> This time the Magdalene is a green square box, clumsily and naively designed for today, but interesting precisely because of this immediacy. The round title has mythological proportions and the black and white symbolic photograph shows nothing of sentimentality but the triumph of technology. However, since the scripture is not intended for design dogmas, I will abbreviate. Titania is the name of the product and it is a handmade macchino per pasta. <p/> My grandmother gave me this metal beast because she knows I like to cook. The seller's internal stamp shows that it was bought on 9 May 1968 in the shop 'La Casalinga' in Gorizia. Although I have never seen either my grandmother or my mother make pasta themselves - with or without a pasta maker - I have made one quite solid pasta from the first one. <p/> The process goes like this. First, the home-made dough is pushed through two rotating rollers, which roll the dough evenly into strips. Repeat the process, if necessary, with a narrower gap between the two rollers, depending on the type of pasta you want. Then pass the strips through the second spout, turn the crank and watch with glowing hearts the culinary miracle - noodles coming out the other side. Ugh, haute cuisine. <p/> Pasta is not exactly Slovenia's national dish and it arrived on the shelves relatively late. As I have gleaned from the web, the Mlinotest pasta factory was built in the late 1950s (proudly made since 1958). Housewives were stretching and drying simple noodles in their backyards long before that, since a product made of flour, eggs and water is a generic phenomenon rather than the alchemist's secret of a lodge of freebooters. <p/> If there is one product from our culinary treasure chest that is anti-potentine, it is the miller. They are made from rolled-out dough that has been baked in a whole piece in a bread oven, usually after baking bread. The baked dough was broken into larger pieces, soaked in water and thickened with whatever gravel was on hand. <p/> Since we don't usually have bread ovens at home, we can fascinate our invited guests with home-made pasta and hum a light Italian canzone as we turn the crank. Or spin a bouquet of evergreen Slovenian songs. Remember, we're in the sixties.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
223,"I suspect that there are at least a handful of us who remember all too well the days when Ray Cokes used to roll the Slayers unreservedly in prime time and when, in the admittedly slightly later hours of the night, MTV Europe used to play a lot of what we still throw into the drawer of alternative and not overly commercial brass bands and brass bands were listened to, not just watched. I wouldn't really debate the diversity of tastes here, but there was a lot to be heard on that channel in its day, especially if you were persisting in a late-night ambush or suffering from insomnia. It would be difficult to judge the current state of mind of all the various derivatives of this brass band institution; I have not been following it for some time, but judging by the words of my younger colleagues, the spirit of the eighties and early nineties has got a bit stuck and has gone on holiday somewhere unknown. <p/> Why such a butch introduction, anyway? Simply because Arrested Development is one of those bands that, without MTV and its inventions like Unplugged, would almost certainly not be known here. This predominantly black collective came to our country in the first half of the nineties on the waves of the aforementioned TV channel with their debut album, etched themselves in our little brains for eternity and then somehow disappeared from our consciousness, so the announcement of CUK in Šiška came as quite a surprise to me. I have to admit, I was almost convinced that AD had disbanded a long time ago, so I was quite happy to see them in Šiška, almost as happy as the fact that last year they released a quite decent and listenable album Strong, which, although it doesn't bring any particular surplus, is a quite pleasant read and the hiphop-funky-Motown inspired melodies easily crawl under your skin, which has been AD's virtue from the very beginning. All in all, a show that would be a sin to miss. <p/> If talking about the fact that the performers wowed the assembled crowd is usually as predictable as possible, I can say exactly that about Arrested Development's performance in Šiška. I haven't seen so many happy and satisfied people per square metre in a long time. Although Šiška wasn't bursting at the seams, it was exactly so full that one could comfortably move around, raise one's hands and sing a little here and there, although it was obvious that the majority of the crowd hadn't come any further than their debut album and, understandably, they were mostly tripping on those good old shtick that had gotten under our skin, or on the musical interludes of the legendary Bob Marley or the slightly less legendary 4 Non Blondes. AD are obviously well aware that their reach in Europe, where they have come after many years, was quite limited and that their brass band alone is just a bit too little to get people up on their feet, but on the other hand, it is a commendable act that the collective did not descend to the level of musical aspirations, although it was just not possible without the most famous shtick, especially in the finale. The intensity of the concert itself was at a high level from the very beginning and it got a bit higher towards the end, also thanks to the drum, bass and karaoke interludes, which, although they cheapened the overall impression a bit for my taste, then in a long encore, perhaps better said in the second part of the concert, they brought the show perfectly to the grand finale, when the brakes were released and the chemistry between the band and the audience worked so well that we can already speak of perfection. <p/> As they like to point out, AD play brass music for the people, by the people, and it would be really hard to find a better demonstration of this principle, especially if we're talking about big concerts, or concerts where at least a hundred or so heads are packed in and there's no question of an intimate atmosphere. There is no doubt that the ADs are well tuned and well tied and know exactly what and how to do to ensure that entertainment, mixed with a good-natured knock on the all-embracing human consciousness, achieves its aim and purpose. Truth be told, AD haven't come up with anything too revolutionary in the last fifteen years, but they make up for it perfectly with the sincerity they put into their music and, apparently, their performances, so it seems they are still that fresh band that exploded in our ears in the early nineties. There wasn't as much of a throwback in their performance as you might expect, more a kind of timelessness caught up in the here and now and a fascination with it, just as the band themselves seemed fascinated by the response they were getting. Look at the photographs and it might be clearer to you what I am trying to say. <p/> In short, the AD concert was simply an uninhibited, relaxed experience of an unpretentious brass band trying to please a wide audience, but not quite everybody and not exactly at any price, which is of course good for the audience, but a little less grateful for the performers themselves, who somehow remain in the shadow of the brass band, which in one way or another, not even necessarily a bad one, stands out and the whole. It's certainly fine and dandy to hear something new and unusual, but even simple entertainment, which nevertheless has a message and is not entirely shallow, is not superfluous and comes in handy now and then. AD are masters at this and it was a real pleasure to listen to them here for the first time, and I hope not for the last time.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
224,"I propose to the Government of Slovenia that, in the event of any illiquidity or insolvency, it should call in a popular loan of EUR 5 billion at 5% interest per annum. The moratorium on payment is 5 years and then payment of principal and interest in 5 annual instalments. <p/> The above-mentioned People's Loan shall be duly presented in the mass media and in all media in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia and citizens shall be called upon to do their utmost to help preserve the financial sovereignty of the country. <p/> All citizens of the Republic of Slovenia and all legal entities with their registered office in the Republic of Slovenia are eligible to contribute. <p/> We know from the past that we have already had similar people's loans (the Skopje earthquake, the Austro-Hungarian road loan, the famous war loans, etc.). <p/> Having said that, I would like to point out that the first way to save the banks is to sell their own assets (redundant offices, business premises, union tourism facilities in spas and by the sea and in the mountains) and to pledge and secure the claims of legal and natural persons (flats, houses, businesses, etc.), and then the state should come to the rescue. It is also necessary to limit the salaries of managers in all state-owned companies and institutions to no more than the salary of the President of the country, the Prime Minister... No one can have more, least of all the quasi-experts. For example, the director of NKBM last year reported an annual income of over 270 000 euros, the bank is in the red, Mr Kramar from Izlak has a 1 million euro bonus for 5 years of management plus salary, and NLB has almost 2 billion bad loans, which it is utopian to believe will ever be repaid. If we are playing such games and delusional thinking, all the measures taken by the government and the savings made by all the employees are meaningless. Or the recently published report by the Court of Auditors that the investment in 2 blocks for 170 prisoners at Dob Prison has risen from EUR 6 million to EUR 87 million. Of course, no one will be held accountable, and we will not show the door to any of the 'experts'. It just happens. As long as we do, we will be in for a dive. Do you remember that the Yugoslav Royal Government fled to London in 1941 with tens of tonnes of the country's gold reserves. Today, of course, I do not mean the government, which is doing its best (a few years too late, unfortunately, because we all dreamt of a success story), but individual entrepreneurs, managers and directors. Where will you go, gentlemen? <p/> When the Austrian lands (of which today's Slovenia was a part) were threatened by the Turkish menace, they took away the bells and the silver and gold mass chalices and ritual utensils from the churches, they burned the mass coats in which the gold and silver threads were knitted, they introduced an anti-Turkish tax. The Tlacian Raj, as well as the local feudal lords, groaned under the weight of the burden imposed on them by the imperial office in Vienna. But we escaped the Turkish threat and the Ottoman yoke, with enormous human and material losses that would be felt for decades and centuries to come. So today, if we come together as we did in 1991, we are able to preserve the financial sovereignty of the R.S.S.R. Look, Greece has received and will receive more than €100 billion in aid (I don't know how it will pay it back, probably never! ). Its richest citizens alone have almost €200 billion invested in foreign banks. No comment is needed here. <p/> For me, the financial sovereignty of our country is not something that I would be prepared to sacrifice for. I am sure that the gentlemen from Brussels will manage our money better than our politicians do. As for the Greeks and their money, they are usually successful businessmen, and they are by no means stupid enough to buy in bulk the bonds of a country that is likely to go bankrupt within a few months. <p/> There are more than enough funds in the accounts of R Slovenia residents to sort things out (at least for now! ) on our own without asking for foreign help. But our citizens also have bank accounts in banks in Austria, Liechtenstein, etc. If everyone contributes as much as they can, the matter is solved. We can also guarantee our citizens the eventual sale of Telekom, Petrol, etc., so that they know that they will get their money back in any case. Bonds could be subscribed for at the counters of banks, post offices, administrative units, etc. This is not quite the same as buying treasury bills and the like. With my proposal, we would be buying our country's financial independence and, therefore, our future. Why have money in a sock or in the bank at 2% interest and know that you have done something good for yourself, your children and the whole country of R Slovenia by paying into the People's Loan. That's how it is. This should be an all-Slovenian action, like the signing of the May Day Declaration or something similar during the Austro-Hungarian period. But as I said, no one in state-owned or majority state-owned companies can have a salary higher than the President of the Republic, the Government, etc. (that's 65 pay grade). If we do not solve this problem too, we will have done nothing. There will always be leeches who will try to suckle at the state teat. I would not discuss the professionalism of these gentlemen, otherwise we would not be where we are, which is nowhere. The way they have run things, they would be any economics graduate who takes up his first job as a trainee. I think that he would have been driven by his profession and the professional challenge, whereas these gentlemen were driven solely by the drive for money. <p/> The Government regularly issues bonds. Any EU citizen or company can open a company here and buy the bonds mentioned in the proposal. So they would be no different from other bonds. This government, which is now ""trying its best"", has only recently blocked the much-needed reforms of the previous government through referendums.... in some cases practically the same laws as it is now proposing. Let's not forget this.... Given the way our politicians view the benefit of the state, in fact, coercive administration by Brussels seems to me to be a better idea by the day. As much damage as our own politicians are doing to us, those in Brussels certainly will not do it.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

236,"Annual General Meeting, 19 March 2013 <p/> Traditionally, and in accordance with the law and the provisions of the Statutes of our Association, the General Meeting, as the highest body, adopted the report on the activities, the financial report and the report of the Supervisory Committee for the year 2012. This was the first year of the new term of office of the bodies of the Association and the 22nd year since the founding of the Association. <p/> Of course, we remained true to our mission. Raising awareness among the membership and the general population about the importance of cardiovascular disease prevention has been, is and will continue to be a constant feature of our work. <p/> The reports were adopted unanimously by the branch representatives present. <p/> In short, we can report that we have achieved most of the tasks we set ourselves in our work programme. <p/> We would like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the innovations that have marked the Slovenian prevention scene, in particular the measurement of the ankle-brachial index, the atrial fibrillation prevention programme, for which we have been awarded a global prize since the end of 2011, and the establishment of the 25 × 25 network of NGOs in the field of public health. All three of these innovations have been widely covered by the Slovenian media. We carried out all the well-known preventive measurements and added venous plethysmography, helped several thousand people with various advice, and organised many interesting lectures and workshops. <p/> The magazine For the Heart has been our hallmark for the past year. We are proud of all 7 issues and also at the AGM we thanked the editorial board headed by Prof. Dr. Ales Blinec, MD. <p/> We organised many hikes, excursions and other forms of recreation. If we were to add up all the kilometres walked by our hikers and walkers, we would come up with a big number. <p/> The World Heart Day events started with a march in Novo mesto and continued with events in various places around Slovenia, with the main event taking place at the BTC in Ljubljana. <p/> It is also worth remembering Melodies for the Heart.

238,"Address by Dr Dimitrij Rupel, President of the General Affairs and External Relations Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Slovenia, at the meeting of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) - presentation of the results of the Gymnich meeting <p/> Spoken word counts! <p/> Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament! <p/> Allow me to present some highlights from the discussions of the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers - Gymnich, which took place on 28 and 29 March in Brdo and Bled, Slovenia. On the agenda of the meeting were: the role of Syria in the Middle East, EU-Russian Federation relations, the European perspective of the Western Balkans, intercultural dialogue and Tibet. <p/> THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE ROLE OF SYRIA <p/> The first topic of the Gymnich was a discussion on the situation in the Middle East and the role of Syria. The timing of the discussion on the Middle East peace process and Syria was appropriate given the widespread perception that the Annapolis process is slow or stalled, that there is no change on the ground, that Israel continues to take unilateral measures and that there is a crisis in Gaza. <p/> I briefed colleagues on the assessment and results of my recent visit to the region, where I had the opportunity to exchange views with PR Mubarak of Egypt, MFA Al-Gheit, Arab League GA Moussa, PR Abbas, FM Fayyad, MFA Al-Malki, Israeli PR Peres, FM Olmert, MFA Livni, Netanyahu, Serry and other interlocutors. The talks or assessments of the peace process were dominated by scepticism on the Arab side and moderate optimism on the Palestinian and Israeli sides. <p/> We agreed that a final solution to the BVMP should include Syria. We agreed not to isolate Syria but rather to consider including it. In the past, Syria has taken advantage of our disunity, and we decided to pay more attention to coordinating EU Member States' and EU institutions' contacts with Syria. <p/> We decided that we should not reward ""bad behaviour"" <p/> Solidarity with Lebanon and the Siniora government is needed. <The EU will continue to support the Annapolis process and looks forward to a positive outcome in Moscow. <p/> EU-RUSSIAN FEDERATION <p/> Another important item on the first day of the meeting was the exchange of views on current developments in the Russian Federation and on EU-Russia relations, including in the context of the preparations for the June Summit. The complexity of EU-Russia relations in the political, security and energy fields was underlined. At the same time, the fact that Russia is our largest neighbour and an important strategic partner was highlighted. The June summit is an opportunity to strengthen political dialogue at the highest level and to convey messages to the new Russian leadership. The strategic partnership with Russia needs to be developed as a whole, ensuring EU unanimity and solidarity. Cooperation with Russia also needs to be strengthened in joint ESDP missions and in addressing international issues in the common neighbourhood with a view to ensuring security, peace and security. <p/> We also discussed the negotiating mandate for the new EU-Russia Framework Agreement (PCA). The majority of countries support the early approval of the negotiating mandate and the start of negotiations for a new framework agreement. This means during the Slovenian Presidency. <p/> Lithuania has also expressed its support for the conclusion of a new PCA. Minister Vaitiekunas said at Gymnich that Lithuania will be the first to benefit from a regulated relationship between the EU and the RF. Because of the particular problems they have with the RF, they want to add to the mandate for a new agreement: (1) the issue of the closure of the Druzhba oil pipeline and the Ignalina nuclear power plant (at the end of 2009 Lithuania will thus be fully dependent on the RF) (2) the mention of the disappeared Lithuanian entrepreneur (3) the resolution of the frozen conflicts in the common neighbourhood and (4) the guarantee that negotiations can be suspended at any time. They propose that the Secretariat and the EC prepare an analysis on how to boost EU-RF relations. They also advocate relations with the RF at ministerial level. <p/> Incidentally, the UK and French Foreign Ministers Miliband and Kouchner have also written to the Presidency on this issue. In it, they wrote, inter alia, that ""Russia's foreign, security, economic and domestic policies have been a cause for concern in recent years. Perhaps influenced by its new-found value, Russia has questioned the international commitments it made in the 1990s. This has made Russia a more difficult partner. We need to find the right joint response. ... We must underline that we welcome and support President-elect Medvedev's plan to promote the rule of law in Russia. We will certainly judge Russia by its actions, not just its words, and the EU must insist on Russia's compliance with its international commitments on the rule of law and human rights, including those arising from United Nations and Council of Europe documents"". <p/> Ensuring the diversification of energy routes and sources must remain a priority for the EU. The new Framework Agreement should also include a chapter on energy, which is particularly important for the EU in view of the importance of the Russian Federation as an energy supplier. <p/> Realism needs to be brought to relations with Russia. Russia often brings issues into relations with the EU that cause disunity between Member States and increase tensions between them (the issue of frozen conflicts, its attitude towards Kosovo, its opposition to the entry of Ukraine and Georgia into the NATO Membership Action Plan). <p/> The Foreign Ministers underlined the desire to make Russia a trustworthy and transparent partner, which will also be achieved through Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation. <p/> The Presidency, together with the Commission, will ensure that the European Parliament is kept fully informed of progress in the negotiations. <p/> WESTERN BALKANS <p/> I am extremely pleased that at Gymnich we have formulated a positive message on the European perspective of the Western Balkans. We have met all the representatives of the Western Balkans, including the Serbian Foreign Minister Jeremić and the Prime Minister of Kosovo, Mr Thaci. <p/> A general overview of the situation in the Western Balkans shows that much progress has been made in recent years: greater stability, democratic reforms, economic growth, improved regional cooperation, progress towards the EU through the Stabilisation and Association Process. These achievements now need to be consolidated and built upon, and the Western Balkan countries must work to consistently meet the commitments and conditions within the Stabilisation and Association Process. <p/> Already last December, we agreed in the Council that the Commission would prepare a Communication on the Western Balkans and that we would hold a debate on its content early this year. <p/> Fostering direct contacts between the Western Balkan countries and the EU, especially among the younger generation, is crucial for the internalisation and consolidation of European values by the citizens of the region. This applies in particular to citizens of the former SFRY, who were able to travel freely throughout Europe before 1990. In this context, I would like to highlight the dialogue on visa facilitation that we have already started with Serbia (31 January), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (20 February), Montenegro (21 February) and Albania (7 March). At Saturday's meeting, I and my colleagues called for the early completion of the so-called ""roadmaps"" containing realistic criteria for the introduction of a visa-free regime for the countries of the region. We also discussed the possibility of introducing free visas for the countries of the Western Balkans as part of the roadmaps already mentioned. <p/> We also discussed how to further strengthen regional cooperation and economic development in the Western Balkans, both of which are key to further stabilising the region and bringing it closer to the European Union. In this context, the EC Communication highlights a number of important areas and proposes some new initiatives, e.g. in the field of energy and transport (launch of negotiations on a transport agreement), a new initiative to set up an Investment Fund for the Western Balkans, and an initiative for enhanced cooperation between the Western Balkans region and the EU in the field of civil protection. <p/> The establishment of the Regional Cooperation Council (27 February in Sofia) represents another achievement in the field of regional cooperation and an expression of greater regional ownership. <p/> There is unanimity within the EU that the existence of a strong and active civil society is crucial to accelerate the implementation of political and economic reforms, and to strengthen democracy and promote reconciliation in the Western Balkans region. In this context, we at Gymnich welcomed the establishment of a special fund for the development of civil society, as proposed by the EC in its Communication. <p/> Concretising the European perspective of the Western Balkans <p/> The region is specific and needs special encouragement, especially in those countries where the EU integration process is faced with weak political will or low administrative capacity. The EU therefore needs to act with particular determination and courage in the region. The Slovenian Presidency will work to reaffirm and further concretise the European perspective of the countries of the region. <p/> At the meeting, we underlined that significant progress in the accession negotiations is possible in the current year, provided that Croatia meets the ""benchmarks"" and other conditions contained in the EC's March communication. <p/> Despite its difficulties, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has established a positive example of a multi-ethnic society. It needs further support and affirmation to strengthen internal cohesion. We sincerely hope that Skopje will meet the conditions (""benchmarks"") set out in the Accession Partnership as soon as possible, which, on the basis of a positive assessment in the next EC Annual Report, would allow a date to be set for the start of accession negotiations later in 2008. <p/> Montenegro and Albania have recently made significant progress in fulfilling their obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements, which constitutes an important incentive for other countries in the region. In the Brdo Declaration, we called on both countries to accelerate the implementation of the Interim Agreement and to step up efforts to build institutional capacity, public administration and an independent judiciary as a condition for upgrading relations with the EU. <p/> As regards Bosnia and Herzegovina, the implementation of police reform remains a condition for the signing of the SAA, and we underline that BiH's future in the EU is only possible as a united, comprehensive, functional and multi-ethnic state. <p/> Politically and economically, Serbia plays a key role in the region and is currently facing strategic choices about its future. Regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations are key to Serbia's continued progress towards the EU, and Serbia is well placed to play its role as a regional locomotive in this area. <p/> In line with the conclusions of the December European Council, we reiterated at the Gymnich meeting that it is possible to accelerate Serbia's EU approximation, including the granting of candidate status, but that all this depends above all on the will of the current political leadership and of the future one that will take over the helm of Serbia after the May elections. <p/> We stress that we want to separate the EU perspective from the Kosovo issue, but Serbia must ensure that it does not close its own path to the EU or cut all bridges to the EU by taking actions that may threaten the security of the wider region. Statements and/or actions that threaten the stability of Kosovo are not acceptable. <p/> Once again, we have focused a great deal of attention on Kosovo. We have stressed that Kosovo, like the region as a whole, has a clear EU perspective. The EU will continue to work closely with UN KFOR, OSCE and other international actors to consolidate stability. In this context, I would like to underline my conviction that the full and effective deployment of EULEX and the ICO throughout the territory of Kosovo will be an expression of the success of our commitment to Kosovo's stability and the success of the CFSP as a whole. The maintenance of the UNMIK presence and the full implementation of the mandate under UNSCR 1244 throughout the territory of Kosovo is a key prerequisite for the stabilisation of the situation. In this respect, we consider it of the utmost importance to initiate the EU/EULEX/ICO political dialogue with the Kosovo Serbs. The stability of Kosovo is crucial for the stability of the entire region. <p/> INTERCULTURAL DIALOGUE <p/> Intercultural dialogue was the final theme of the Gymnich. The discussion focused on an assessment of the latest developments in Tibet and on the question of attitudes towards Islam, including in the light of the recently released film by Dutch MP Wilders. <p/> Concerning Tibet, we reiterated our concern about the latest developments, condemned the violence and expressed our solidarity with the victims. We called for an end to the violence and expressed our expectation that the Chinese authorities ensure transparency of information and free media access to Tibet. It was stressed that the Dalai Lama is seeking autonomy, not independence, for Tibet. In this context, we stressed the demand for the preservation of the Tibetan language, culture, religion and traditions. We agreed to pay particular attention to the human rights situation in Tibet. <p/> On the relationship with Islam, the debate was focused on the recent release of a film by Dutch MEP Wilders on Islam. The principle of the right to freedom of expression was stressed, but it was also pointed out that Islam cannot be identified with violence. Most Muslims reject extremism and violence, and the victims of extremism and violence include members of the Islamic faith. Freedom of speech, which is and remains a fundamental value of the EU, must respect the faith and beliefs of others. <p/> Concerns were also expressed, among other things, about the ongoing legal proceedings against the Turkish AK Party and its members. If banned, this would be the first case of a political party winning a democratic election being banned, which would also be contrary to the opinion of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe.",Other,train

This time it is an adaptation of the song "" Le Krka ve "", which was recorded in 1996 by the Suhokranj ensemble Poljub.

From now on, the rhythm of this ensemble, based in Postojna, will be provided by Miha Kokalj. Miha comes from central Slovenia, Moravce to be precise, and his father is the guitarist of the legendary Franco Mihelič ensemble. <p/> The Luba Užmaha ensemble comes from Štajerska, specifically from Šentjur and Šmarje pri Jelšah, and has been on the folk music scene for 14 years. They have been playing in their current ensemble for three years, so they decided to record a song.

In an hour and a half, Robert Simonišek showed us the other side of poetry, showed us what a poem can be, encouraged us to think about more challenging texts, to think about poetic freedom, the structure of poetry, to talk about Slovenian attitudes towards poetry and to say something about the somewhat bitter topic that we are reluctant to talk about, that sometimes Slovenian lessons have the opposite effect and discourage young people from poetry. Malgajev people are trying to change this by inviting real poets to speak, by daring to talk about pressing issues and by allowing the poetic language the freedom it has won in the world of art.

In addition to the above, you can watch excerpts from films on the theme of the post office and an animated film entitled Whose Letter Is It? The relocation of the museum has a special significance for the inhabitants of Polhov Gradec, as the post horn is returning to their town.

256,"Mole <p/> Mole <p/> The common or European mole (scientific name Talpa europaea) is a species of insectivore adapted to life underground. It rarely comes to the surface except during dry periods when it goes in search of water. Signs of its presence are moles. <p/> Mole shrews are active both during the day and at night, constantly searching for food. They dig tunnels at different depths. If the tunnel is just below the surface, it starts to throw soil to the surface, creating a mole. The tunnels can be 30 to 50 metres long. When looking for food, it runs through the tunnels for four hours and then rests for the same amount of time. Although the tunnels of different moles may be intertwined, they avoid each other, especially outside mating season. If they do meet, a fierce fight ensues, which can lead to death. Scientists hypothesise that moles also mark their territory by scent-marking the ground from the musk glands located on their abdomens. It is only during mating season that the male seeks out the female. After mating, the male leaves the female to care for the young. <p/> It feeds mainly on earthworms, although it will not give up insects and snails. The mole needs a lot of food and eats half its own weight daily. The greyhound does not have a well-developed sense of hearing and smell, but can still detect food and water at long distances. Because it lives underground in the dark, it does not need good eyesight. However, it has a well-developed sense of smell and can detect very faint vibrations. Its muzzle is covered with hairs, which help it to find prey. The mole has more sense organs than any mammal. We know very little about its sense organs. Because they cause damage to meadows and fields, farmers often kill them. <p/> The mating season of moles is very short. The male seeks out the female underground, where they mate. The male then leaves the female and is no longer interested in the fetus. Gestation lasts for one month. Three or four young are born between May and July in a nest for which the female has built a special room. They are naked when they are born, but after 24 days they have grown fur. They can leave the nest after 35 days to find their own territory. <p/> Protection <p/> In Slovenia, moles are protected and deterrents are used to combat them. We have developed an extremely effective and natural deterrent, Celaflor Mole Repellent, in the form of beads with the active ingredient methylnonylon ketone. It is completely harmless to humans and animals. It is important to follow the instructions on the product and to allow the mole to escape from your garden (do not fence the garden on all sides with beads).",Information/Explanation,train

259,"Baselines. Psychiatric patients, and especially alcoholics, are subject to stigmatisation, negative social perceptions and prejudices. The aim of our study was to examine the stigmatization and self-stigmatization of alcoholics in our cultural setting comparatively with regard to gender, alcohol consumption, alcoholic identity, age and educational structure. <p/>Methods. We used a semi-structured questionnaire with items related to different social perceptions regarding alcoholics. Respondents (n = 337) were sampled in an Alcoholism Treatment Dispensary and two general/family medicine outpatient clinics. Data were processed using t-test and factor analysis. <p/>Results. Women had more negative perceptions and more empathy towards alcoholics, men were more lenient and lacked empathy towards addicts, people with no identity as an alcoholic had more negative perceptions, both negative and positive perceptions loaded more with age, and both negative and positive perceptions loaded less and empathic perceptions of alcoholics loaded more with higher education. <p/>Conclusions. In our cultural environment, the stigmatization of alcoholics is very high and stronger than self-stigmatization. With higher education, it fades. Therapists involved in the treatment of alcoholics have had to revise our own perceptions of the stigmatisation of our patients, which will also influence our therapeutic approach. <p/>From social psychology comes the theoretical knowledge of implicit perceptions that we are rarely aware of, but which nevertheless have a profound influence on our behaviour and attitudes towards other people. Kelly observed that if we have dual information about people, we first follow our first impression and the information we have received from others. These perceptions give rise to prejudice, which is negative ideas about other people.1 The theory of social perceptions was pioneered by Moscovici in 1961.2 They represent the social knowledge of a group of people: a system of ideas, values and behavioural patterns that facilitates communication between members of the same group.3 Social perceptions are the basis for individual thinking and knowledge and are the result of an ongoing dialogue between members of the same group.4 They are the basis of attributions about how we understand other people's behaviour.5 Research on adult populations has pointed to three different conclusions about the stigma of mental disorders.6 The first is that people with mental disorders are more stigmatised than people with physical illnesses, and that those who abuse alcoholic beverages are more stigmatised than people with mental disorders. Another finding is that stereotypes associate mental disorders with irresponsibility and danger in individuals, leading to negative emotional reactions and discriminatory behaviour. The third finding is that personal knowledge of mentally disordered individuals reduces stigma. It also identifies discrimination due to self-stigmatisation.7 The character of the drinker is inferred from the drinker's behaviour under the influence of alcohol. The more he or she drinks, the stricter our judgement. Although we often stigmatise drinkers who drink larger quantities of alcoholic beverages, we often perceive them to be more cheerful. Our own drinking habits have a big influence on our judgement. Thus, heavy drinkers do not judge other drinkers as strongly as moderate drinkers or teetotalers.8 The aim of the present study is to determine social perceptions of alcoholics both in the general population and among alcoholics, and to identify differences in perceptions according to drinking patterns, age, gender and education. Our working hypotheses were that self-stigmatisation of alcoholics is greater than that of non-problem drinkers and that stigmatisation by relatives is milder than that by those who have no experience of living with an alcoholic. <p/> Methods <p/> Sample <p/> A questionnaire was distributed to patients in three outpatient clinics. The first group of patients was a group of alcohol-dependent patients and their relatives who are under treatment in the Dispensary for the Treatment of Alcoholism and Other Addictions at the Dr. Adolf Drolc Health Centre in Maribor. The other two groups of patients were sampled consecutively in two general medicine outpatient clinics from the same health centre. One outpatient clinic was selected in the city centre, the other in Lovrenec na Pohorju. In total, 337 completed questionnaires were obtained. 149 men and 188 women completed them. The whole sample was divided several times into several subgroups, which were then compared with each other. 146 of them had the experience of living with a person who is dependent on alcohol. 60 were alcohol dependent and 49 were alcohol abusers. In terms of educational structure, most of them had a vocational education (71 or 21.1%), a secondary education (88 or 26%) and a higher education (98 or 29.1%). The mean age of the subjects was 41.4 years + 13.9 years. The group sampled at the Alcoholism and Other Drug Treatment Dispensary included 11 alcoholics who had been in treatment for less than six months and 31 who had been in treatment for six months or more. The results of their relatives' group were added to a group of people from the general population who answered yes to the question whether anyone in their family was a frequent drinker. <p/> Instrument <p/> Description of the instrument <p/> We constructed an instrument containing independent variables (sex, age, education, family history of binge drinking, whether someone is a recovering alcoholic), 44 items relating to perceptions of alcohol dependence (a five-point scale of agreement), three open-ended statements to be completed (a test of incomplete sentences), and six questions testing attitudes towards drinking. The instrument is reproduced in full in the Annex. <p/> Validity and reliability <p/> The rational validity of the questionnaire was obtained on account of the broad coverage of views (interviewing professionals involved in the treatment of alcohol dependence, interviewing alcohol dependents and people in frequent contact with alcohol dependents [ waitresses ]), the theoretical background on stigmatisation and self-stigmatisation of addicts6-8 and the three experts who analysed the individual items. Factor analysis was used for empirical validity. We extracted five factors which explain 45.14% of the variance. Factor 1 - "" Factor of strongly negative attitudes "" explains 19.16% of the variance, Factor 2 - "" Factor of positive attitudes "" explains 9.50% of the variance, Factor 3 - "" Factor of empathy towards alcoholics "" explains 7.27% of the variance, Factor 4 - "" Factor of empathic attitude "" explains 5.24% of the variance, and Factor 5 - "" Factor of personal accountability and negative perceptions "" explains 3.99% of the variance. External validity was not established because we did not have a pre-existing instrument measuring attitudes towards alcohol dependence. Reliability analysis was carried out using Crombach's coefficient a. This was 0.859, indicating exemplary reliability.9 Item-by-item reliability analysis was also carried out. We found that the reliability of the instrument could have been improved slightly if five items had been dropped, but we decided to keep them as they were items relating to empathy, which was of interest to us in the study. On a smaller sample (n = 20), we further tested the reliability by means of a test-retest method and checked for correlation. <p/> Statistical analysis <p/> Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-11.5 and SPSS-13.0 statistical packages. We were interested in statistically significant differences between the independent variables, considering significant differences at p &lt; 0.05. Comparisons were made using t-test for independent samples and analysis of variance. Factor analysis was also performed. We used the Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) method and the Oblimin oblique rotation method. <p/> Results <p/> Comparison of item differences by gender <p/> Statistically significant differences were found for as many as 20 social perceptions. In the whole sample, women gave more value to negative perceptions (destroying families, aggressive, annoying, would betray and sell everything for alcohol), more to empathic perceptions (seeking oblivion and comfort, not finding their own way out of a crisis, not being able to heal themselves), and a difference was also found for the item preferring to avoid it. Men in the whole sample gave more value to performances from which a defensive attitude could be seen (everyone has some form of addiction, everyone has a reason to get drunk, alcoholics are promiscuous as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they make me feel good about myself, they are cheerful, they put me in a good mood, I prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler), on the other hand, men are less empathetic (I don't care about them, they should pay more for health insurance, an alcoholic is converted when he rolls in a pit), they are more likely to be labelled ""losers"", they are more likely to see alcoholism as a hereditary disease, and they are more likely to prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler than women. <p/> Differences are present for only two items in the whole sample. Alcoholics are preferred by those without experience of living with an alcoholic, and those with experience place more value on the notion that alcoholism is a genetically determined, hereditary disease. <p/> Comparison of item differences according to the rating of being harmful or dependent on alcohol <p/> Differences between these two subgroups of the total sample are present for eight items. People who drink harmfully were more likely to describe alcoholics negatively than alcoholics themselves (they use alcohol as an excuse to fail, they are unreliable, calculating and exploitative), they have no empathy for alcoholics (they don't care about them, they should pay more for health insurance), even though they prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler (they do not care about them, they should pay more for health insurance). Alcohol-dependent people gave more value to the item that it makes them feel bad to see others making fun of alcoholics and that alcoholics feel guilty about their own dependence. <p/> Comparison of item differences on problem drinking <p/> Differences between the subgroups of the full sample are present for nine items. People who were harmful or dependent on alcohol gave higher scores to items that showed leniency towards the dependent and a defensive attitude (everyone has a reason to drink as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they are happy, they put me in a good mood, they make me feel good about myself, everyone has some form of dependence, alcohol is a hereditary disease). People without a problematic attitude towards drinking gave higher value to two items (they are bad guys and I prefer to avoid it). <p/> Comparison of item differences according to the presence of an alcoholic identity <p/> Differences are present for six items. People in the treatment programme with an alcoholic identity gave higher values to items with an empathic perception of alcoholics (they have feelings of guilt, it makes me feel bad when others make fun of them) and to the item that alcoholism is a hereditary disease, while people without this identity gave higher values to items with a negative label (they are unreliable, calculating and exploitative, they use alcohol as an excuse to fail). <p/> Comparison of item differences by age <p/> The total sample was divided into three groups: young people up to 29 years (n = 74), people between 30 and 59 years (n = 220) and people aged 60 and over (n = 39). There was a statistically significant difference for 12 items. For the six items with negative social perceptions (they are wrinkles, they are calculating and exploitative, they are violent and arrogant, they are weak, neglectful and intrusive, and they don't care), the value of the items increases with age everywhere. The three items with positive perceptions (as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they are cheerful, they make me feel good about myself) have the same trend of increasing value with increasing age. Similarly with the item ""I don't care about them"". The item that alcoholism is a response to inner distress was given the highest values by middle-aged people and the lowest values by the oldest generations. For the item that alcoholism is a hereditary disease, the highest values were given by the oldest and the lowest by the youngest people. <p/> Comparison of item differences by education <p/> The educational structure of the total sample was divided into three groups: people with incomplete, completed primary school and vocational secondary school (n = 107), people with completed secondary school (n = 88) and people with completed higher and university education (n = 128). Statistically significant differences are present for 22 items. All negative perceptions (they are wrinkles, they are annoying and disrespectful, they are calculating and exploitative, they are violent and arrogant, they allow themselves too much, they should be treated against their will, they are neglectful, they are disruptive and pushy, alcoholics are promiscuous, they don't care, they are guilty of addiction themselves) are lower in people with higher education and highest in people with the lowest education. Similarly, positive perceptions (everyone has a reason to get drunk as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they are happy, I prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler, they give me a sense of self-satisfaction, everyone has some form of addiction). Items expressing empathy (I feel sorry for them, I feel bad when others make fun of them) have the reverse trend - higher values at higher education levels. ""I don't care about them"" has the highest weighting for the lowest educated and the lowest for the highest educated. ""Alcoholism is a hereditary disease"" has the highest value in the lowest educated group. <p/> Fig. 1. Differences on the first factor between the subgroup of alcoholics in treatment for less than 6 months (SOA &lt; 6 months), alcoholics in treatment for more than 6 months (SOA &gt; 6 months) and the group of people with no alcoholic identity (control group). <p/>Factor analysis of the sample <p/>The value of the Keiser-Meyer-Olkin test of sample adequacy (0.828) and the result of the Bartlett test (p = 0.000) indicate that there is a significant association between the variables. Five factors were taken into account, together explaining 45.2% of the variance. The first factor explains 19.2% of the variance. It is occupied by strongly negative social perceptions (they are disruptive and intrusive, violent and arrogant, neglectful, annoying and disrespectful, calculating and exploitative, they are wrinkles, they do not care, alcoholics are promiscuous, they would sell and betray everything, they are bad people, they should be treated against their will and they should pay more for health insurance). The second factor explains 9.5% of the variance and is occupied by positive perceptions of alcoholics (they are happy as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they give me a sense of satisfaction with myself, I prefer them to teetotalers and everyone has a reason to get drunk). The third factor (7.3% of the variance) is occupied by the items of empathic attitudes towards alcoholics (alcoholism is a response to inner distress, I feel bad when others make fun of them, they are victims of childhood, they pity me, they cannot find their own way out of the crisis, they cannot cure themselves, they have feelings of guilt about their addiction). The fourth factor (5.2% of the variance) is occupied by the empathic attitude items, which have a negative loading, which can be understood as a refusal to establish an empathic relationship with them (they feel that nobody likes them, that they are looked down upon, that everybody hates them, they seek oblivion and comfort in alcohol). The fifth factor (4.0% of the variance) is occupied by two negative items that are not as negatively emotionally charged as the items in the first factor (they destroy families, they are unreliable) and two items that attribute personal responsibility for the onset of dependence. Again, there were differences between the groups. Women significantly loaded more heavily on the first factor than men (p = 0.000), similarly, people who abuse alcoholic beverages loaded more heavily on the first factor than alcoholics (p = 0.047), and people with a problematic drinking pattern loaded more heavily on the second factor than people with a neutral attitude towards drinking. The unstructured part of the questionnaire asked for three follow-up thoughts. The first was: ' When I think of a person who is dependent on alcohol, I think of... "", the second: "" When I think of a person dependent on alcohol, I feel ..."". and the third: "" If the alcohol-dependent person were my son, I would ..."". The first question was most frequently answered with family in 15, the second with sadness (11.6), fear (9.2), anxiety (8.3), sympathy (7.1%) and anger (6.5%), and the third with motivation for treatment (37.4%) and help (24.3%). The only statistically significant difference between these responses was in the second thought, where women were more likely to respond that they felt fear in themselves when they were with an alcoholic (p = 0.048). <p/> Discussion <p/> We found many statistically significant differences between the samples, but unfortunately we cannot discuss all of them here. Therefore, we will only highlight the most pronounced and surprising ones. Our hypothesis that the self-stigmatisation of alcoholics is greater than the stigmatisation of people who are not problem drinkers has been shown to be false. It was influenced by our own narrow social perceptions, when the authors, as therapists in constant contact with sober alcoholics in the therapeutic process, seemed to have gradually lost our own prejudices against these people and inferred from them the perceptions of the general population. Thus, people who harm alcoholics label alcoholics more negatively and lack empathy towards them, which is understood as using their own defences in terms of projection and denial. They see in addicts their own path to alcoholism, their own projection into a future that they hate because they feel powerless to change that path. When they evaluate them, they are in a sense evaluating themselves. However, they, along with the addicts, still showed more leniency towards the alcohol-dependent than people with a neutral attitude towards alcohol, and they were significantly more likely to label alcoholics as bad guys. There was an even clearer difference between people with an alcoholic identity and those without. The former showed much more empathy towards alcoholics, while those without showed significantly more negative social perceptions and prejudices. Factor analysis confirmed these results. People who abuse alcoholic beverages loaded more heavily on the factor with negative items than alcoholics, and the same for women, among whom there is less problematic consumption of alcoholic beverages. On the other hand, people with a problematic attitude towards alcohol loaded more heavily on the factor with positive items than people without a drinking problem. An interesting result is provided by comparing people with an alcoholic identity: those in treatment for up to six months and those in treatment for more than six months. The former significantly loaded more heavily on the first factor than the latter, indicating the influence of the treatment process in terms of alleviating prejudice and abandoning defensive attitudes: by accepting the identity of a treated alcoholic, they have less need to project negative self-images onto ""other"" alcoholics. Our second hypothesis was that relatives would have fewer prejudices against alcoholics than people without this experience. This hypothesis also proved to have no real basis in the sample comparison. The only differences between the two samples were that people without this experience prefer to avoid alcoholics rather than those with it, as evidenced by the sad experience in our Alcoholism Treatment Dispensary of seeing patients who repeat over and over again the well-established, albeit highly pathological and painful, life experiences of living with alcoholics, and that relatives of alcoholics are more likely to see alcoholism as a hereditary disease compared to people without this experience. This difference is probably due to the fact that many of the relatives have been involved in our treatment programmes and that many of the alcoholics in our programmes have had an alcoholic as a relative, so that through the education of the addicts and their relatives, this perception has settled in. The gender differences were interesting. On the one hand, women were typically more likely to have negative social perceptions of alcoholics, but at the same time showed more empathic perceptions towards them. The first part can be understood as a consequence of the fact that women are less likely to be alcohol dependent than men,10 which confirms the aforementioned fact that our hypothesis of greater self-stigmatisation was not supported by the evidence. The second part can be seen as a consequence of women's greater social orientation towards empathic perception of other people.11 For men, the responses were in the opposite direction: they showed a greater defensiveness towards (their own) addiction and a lack of empathic perception of alcoholics. Here we also encounter gendered social perceptions of how alcohol consumption is perceived by men and women, what are acceptable levels and forms of drunkenness. And here we meet strict women, guardians of the family order, peace and the nest, guardians of the circumstances in which children grow up and of family traditions. It is no coincidence that, alongside priests, teachers and doctors, it is women who have helped to build the anti-alcohol movement so enthusiastically, and who have constituted the majority of the membership of these movements.12, 13 Differences according to age have shown a trend towards increasing negative perceptions and prejudices, as well as positive perceptions of alcoholics, with a pronounced defensiveness. It can be concluded that at a younger age attitudes towards alcohol consumption are still relatively neutral, but as the years go by, due to the gradual accumulation of personal experience, more extreme views on addiction grow, both condemnation on the one hand and greater tolerance due to, we assume, a more defensive attitude due to one's own problematic attitude towards alcoholic beverages. Part of these differences can probably be attributed to the fact that first contact with alcoholic beverages is associated with a number of positive effects (validation and acceptance in the society of young people, alcohol as a help and as an alibi for social inadequacies). Negative social perceptions and prejudices correlate even more strongly with educational structure: negative perceptions are highest in the lowest educated group, but so are positive perceptions, presumably due to a higher level of own problematic attitudes towards drinking (alcoholics from the same background have a lower educational level than people from the general population14). On the other hand, higher educated people have a higher level of empathic perception of addicts. <p/> Annex: Questionnaire on perceptions of alcohol dependence <p/> Gender <p/> Age <p/> years. <p/> Education: <p/> incomplete primary school, primary school, vocational secondary school, secondary school, college, university. <p/> On a scale of 1 to 5, please indicate the number that best corresponds to your feelings: <p/> 1 - do not agree at all, 5 - strongly agree. <p/> 1. <p/> Everyone has a reason for getting drunk: social worries, work, family. <p/> 1 <p/> 2 <p/> 3 <p/> YES <p/> NO <p/> - <p/> Do you drink alcoholic beverages practically every day? <p/> YES <p/> NO <p/> Conclusions <p/> Our research has shown an alarming stigmatisation of alcoholics in our cultural environment. Thus, the factor with the highest factor loadings was the factor with negative perceptions of alcoholics, which explained 19.2% of the variance in the factor analysis. Otherwise, the study pointed to large gender, age and educational differences, which we had not expected. Thus, the authors were forced to change our own perceptions of how the wider social environment views alcoholism and the alcoholic. We believed that the environment was much more accepting of alcoholics and often interpreted alcoholics' fear of stigmatisation as an application of their own projections. We have now found that alcoholics' fears of wider social stigma are justified. Especially in the segment of the less educated and women. At this point, we can pause to ask whether the task of therapists working on alcohol dependence is also to change social perceptions of alcoholism. Where there is a lack of knowledge and knowledge, there is room for prejudice and stigmatisation, which is a natural social process. By changing social perceptions and destigmatisation, the authors suggest, social rehabilitation of alcoholics will have greater success and the prognosis for abstinence will be better. Because at present, sober alcoholics are generally more stigmatised after treatment than drunk alcoholics without an alcoholic identity.",Information/Explanation,train
261,"By testing the more widely used and cheaper car models, you are to a large extent influencing people's perceptions of them. How do you view this? We don't want to shape people's opinions on a particular model, because they are not presented from the point of view of 'buy this model, not this one, where this one is roomier, cheaper', etc. In each article we therefore also include inserts that have no prominent role with a particular model, an example of this is when we dropped a piano on the bonnet of a Porsche to see if it could withstand the amount of pressure it was put under. The aim here is just to arouse interest or it is a humorous insert. The programme is there to entertain the viewer, not to form an opinion about a model or a brand. There are other shows for that. <p/> How many people are involved in the production of Tope Gear? Not many. There are something like 10 people in the production team. The rest, like the cameramen and the support team, are on loan from the BBC. <p/>How do you keep things fresh and viewership at the level it is? That's the job of producer Andy Wilmon, who comes in before the start of each season and explains out loud everything we need to change to be different to previous seasons. We (the presenters) are not different because we don't want to change, even though we know that people get tired of things very quickly nowadays. But they still haven't got bored of Top Gear, which is good. And this difference between all the actors on the show brings back a sufficient amount of freshness, constancy and also humour, which the audience appreciates. <p/> The Stig. (Photo: BBC) <p/> The mystery surrounding the Stig probably contributes to this. How important is it for the show that it doesn't find out who it is? The Stig's role is one of the most important in the show, because it really reflects what it means to be a petrol head, but at the same time it's the mystery around his identity that brings that ""appeal"" to the audience. But the Stig is a nameless and faceless character who simply has to remain who he is. He also has the role of test driver, which is a constant, because after Jeremy tests the car and glides through the corner, ""power"", and James scrutinises the details of the finish and soundproofing, while he drives the Bugatti Veyron down the catwalk, it is this car that drives the test circuit and gives a perspective of the power and "" perfomance "" of the car even in time. <p/> Why is it that we never see you and the other presenters driving the car around the track on time? We have deliberately left this role of driving on time to the Stig, with the supercars, and to the guests on the show, with the "" average "" Kia. And that's why it's important that the Stig always stays the same, that the times are comparable, and that the guests are only competing with each other, not with us, because that's not the purpose of this part of the show. <p/> Which one of you would be the fastest if you did a lap with a Kia? Yeah, that would be interesting, but certainly not Jeremy, because he'd be going in a straight line all the time, and James doesn't know where the accelerator is anyway (laughs). So me. If you were reincarnated as a car, which model would be Clarkson and which would be you? Jeremy definitely thinks it would be a Bugatti Veyron or, as a classic, a Lamborghini mivra, but I see it as a V8 Holden because it's a model with a big, loud engine that's fast on the straights and slow in the corners because of the tail tiling (laughs).

267,"Washington Post: Snowden reportedly caused less harm than initial estimates <p/> National Intelligence Director James Clapper has assessed that former National Security Agency (NSA) contract analyst Edward Snowden has caused less harm to US intelligence officials than initially estimated, according to the Washington Post. <p/> ""We are still assessing the damage, but it seems that he did not take away as much material as we first thought. There were a lot of things he could only look at, but he couldn't get them off the system,"" Clapper estimated on Thursday, speaking to the newspaper. He added that the damage was still extensive. <p/> US intelligence officials initially feared that Snowden had leaked data on the armed forces' command and control communications network. This was not to be the case. <p/> Since last year, Snowden has been making public embarrassing facts about the workings of US intelligence, from mass surveillance of Americans to eavesdropping on allied leaders and even economic espionage. <p/> All these publications have so far caused little embarrassment at the top of President Barack Obama's administration, but the essential damage is that the US is exposed as no better than, for example, China, which is regularly accused of hacking and spying. <p/> The US administration is not afraid of embarrassment, because it has already gone through this with the WikiLeaks releases. Intelligence officials are more concerned about whether Snowden might have taken something that could give other countries useful information about the workings of the military and spies. <p/> Clapper's assessment is probably very premature. The world's media have so far published only about 300 documents, Snowden is believed to have another 1.5 million in his possession, and his journalist friend Glenn Greenwald, through whom the documents are going to the media, promises that the saga will not be over so soon. <p/> There are therefore more than too many documents to continue negotiating Snowden's repatriation from Russia in a way that does not immediately put him behind bars. But the intelligence community and the government will first have to swallow their anger and resentment, and they are not yet ready to do so. Some politicians have branded him a traitor - and if he is also charged with treason, the death penalty is also on the table. (sta)",News/Reporting,train

But it was immediately clear to the public that the film was as much anti-fascist as it was anti-Communist, people understood that Ayn Rand meant the story to be about the evils of any dictatorship, and they enthusiastically embraced the film as a protest against Mussolini.

273,"Ravne is situated in the rugged landscape of the lower Mežiška Valley, squeezed into a wide basin, flanked by rich forests, with the Uršlja Mountains standing in the background to the south. This is the most populated part of Carinthia, where the town of Ravne already meets neighbouring Prevalje. Today, Ravne is the largest town in Carinthia, the administrative, economic, educational, sporting and cultural centre of the Mežica Valley, and in many respects beyond the borders of Carinthia. The area around Ravenna has been inhabited since antiquity, when a Roman road led through the town. Roman ceramics, mosaic pebbles, bricks and money have been found on the site of an ironworks. Ravne was first mentioned in 1248 as Guttenstein and as a market square in 1317. The basis for its development was the steel industry, which was only able to develop further with the collapse of the steel industry in Črna, Mežice and Prevalje. The steel industry also developed very quickly, and in 1952 it became a town and changed its name from Guštanj to Ravne na Koroškem. The wider Uršlje Gora area with the Roman Spring, Prežihovna, Ivarč Lake and the ski resorts at Ošven and the sports park at Ravne form the backbone of the tourist offer. The focus is on excursion tourism, with an emphasis on the presentation of cultural and historical heritage (the Ironworks Museum, Ravne Manor) and natural attractions (Votla peč, Uršlja gora), the offer of sports and recreational activities in nature (Ivarčko, Ošven, Ravne Sports Park), and rural tourism or the offer of tourist farms.",Information/Explanation,train
274,"First documentary by Natalia Gros <p/> New Partisan Cinema in cooperation with Film Servis presents a new documentary on sport climbing, directed by Jureto Breceljnik, entitled Chalk & Chocolate. The film tells the story of Natalia Gros, one of the best climbers in the world, who takes on one of the most difficult routes in the country: Histerija (8c) in Mišja Peča. About a year ago, she became the fourth woman in the world to climb this difficult route. The camera follows Natalia's story both during the conquest of Histeria and during the competition season (training, competitions, injuries, testing). The filming started in December 2007, when Natalia first set out on the route, and the crew was with her from day one until the day she climbed the route. It shows both the tears and the joy, with the background of what it takes to achieve your dreams. Natalija started her climbing career at the age of 7 and has been one of the world's top climbers for many years. In 2007, she achieved the European title of her career, and became the most successful female sport climber of the season. Now that she has made her first film, she is thinking of swapping the climbing world for Hollywood when her career is over! <p/> The film has already been previewed at the 3rd International Mountaineering Film Festival 2009 at Cankarjev dom, where it received great applause and two awards.

275,"The Heart Trail in Carinthia <p/> The Heart Trail is approximately 5 kilometres long and has an altitude difference of 180 metres. It is marked with a coloured signpost and almost 20 information boards. It takes about an hour and a half to walk along the trail, and even longer if you actively explore the sights indicated on the signs. <p/> The idea of the Heart Trail was born when looking for ways to offer people a health break. The study circle of Jožica Heber from Dravograd, which is part of the Slovenian Heart and Vascular Society, came up with the idea of a trail, designed and marked it, and offered it as an option for recreational hikes. The technical and organisational work was carried out by Ludvik Pušnik from Dravograd, and the idea was supported by the Dravograd Tourist Board. The trail follows a number of paths and abandoned tracks. In order to add research content to the trail, 20 information points have been erected, where most of the information about Dravograd's natural heritage can be found.Dr Branko Vreš, Rector of the Faculty of Biotechnics in Ljubljana, took care of this, while cultural and historical facts were written down by Marjan Kos, curator of the Koroška Regional Museum in Slovenj Gradec. <p/> The route is not difficult, it is suitable for everyone. It starts at the Health Centre in Dravograd, turns north on the steps and joins the local road Dravograd-Ojstrica at the direction sign at Poberžnik's house. It continues towards the Old Castle. The first stop is at the foresters' house, the Forsthaus, where foresters used to live and work. The house has been preserved in its original form and so has the tower, which catches our eye and had a special purpose. There used to be a nursery nearby, where you can read all about the cultivation of spruce, pine and larch seedlings. The trail then leads to the GradKuplen forest road. At the top, you will have a wonderful view of the town of Dravograd, its surroundings and the vast green forests. The castle shows its former grandeur with a remnant of the wall still standing. The castle was built in the first half of the 12th century, when Bernard of Spanheim became the owner of the Drava Valley. Over the centuries, the castle has changed hands, even being owned by the Counts of Celje and the Habsburgs, among others. North of the castle, a path leads to the ruins of the round court tower, where many a serf's life was extinguished. On the path below the Castle Bytown, a signpost soon directs you to the local Viltužnik-Mori road as you enter the forest. From there, you can see Libeliška gora and Strojna, as well as all three Dravograj bridges, the railway bridge and two road bridges. The view of the Dravograd Lake, created after the construction of the hydroelectric power station, is also extraordinary. The dammed area has developed into a marsh with reedbeds, which provides a rich habitat for many rare plants and animals, including some endangered ones. The lesser spotted bat and the rough bat live here, while the muskrat is common among the larger animals in the lake area. More than 150 species of birds are known to breed here, either permanently or occasionally, and swans are also regular visitors to the lake. <p/> The trail then leads on to the Dravograd-Vič national road, past the Dravograd hotel and petrol station, and winds along the path past the Sports Centre and the cemetery to the Fishermen's Home, where it approaches the River Drava. At Planšak, by the pier, there is a sign explaining the loading of sawn timber, the shayk, the ford and the harbour, and a little further on there is information about the history of the bridge and the bridge tolls. The ford used to cross the Drava only in Dravograd and Trbonyi. The St. Pauli serfs were exempted from the payment of the broadside, bridge and mitre fees, while the others had to give three sausages, cheese and ten eggs in addition to the broadside to be transported in the grain. However, since the ford was in the possession of the land lord of Dravograj, the fordsmen also had to pay her. The information board also tells you all about the smuggling of salt and more. From this westernmost point, the route follows a section of the trim track past a railway bridge that survived the bombing during the Second World War. The power station on the Fisherman's Path is not far from the bridge. It was built to meet the occupier's great demand for electricity and was one of the most modern in Europe at the time. The path then continues up the slope below the post office to the municipality and ends at the Dravograd Health Centre. <p/> Franc Heber, a general practitioner in Dravograd, recommends walking in his clinic, especially for orthopaedic and heart patients, and it has two main benefits: exercise and spiritual calming. Dr Heber told us about the path: ""The path is not too steep and not too long, it takes an hour and a half to walk it. This is the right time for the heart to reach the right frequency, 110 beats per minute. Walking is a great aerobic exercise, as oxygen is the best food for all parts of the body, from the supply of the brain to the heart. ""A walk along the Heart Path offers the freshness of nature and plenty of sunshine, and promises peace and tranquillity and an extraordinary view of Dravograd and its surroundings.

The visitors were the better and more aggressive opponents in the first part of the game, which they managed to build on with a goal by Peterka in the 27th minute and thus went into the break with a one-goal advantage. In the second half, they took a 0:2 lead in the 50th minute on a goal by Turha, but Radomlans had a ready answer. In the 57th minute, Ciriković reduced the deficit with a header, but in the last 15 minutes, Radommer completely outplayed the visitors and scored three times. Tirc equalised in the 78th minute, Cirikovic again for 3:2 in the 88th minute and Vrancic Nik for the final 4:2 in the 93rd minute.

Just before the break, Smukavec took the lead with 3:2, Zalaznik scored in the 9th minute, a minute later Snoj scored his second goal to make it 5:2, and the final 6:2 was set in the 78th minute by Vrhunc Luka, who scored practically on the first touch, having entered less than a minute earlier, replacing the third goal scorer, Jernej Smukavec. <p/> Radomlans recorded their seventh win this season and with 22 points they are in second place, three points behind Dob, but they are also by far the most efficient team, as they shot 26 times, which is less than 4 times per game. <p/> Our second league team will face a big challenge on Sunday, 20.10. at 15:00, when last year's first league champion Aluminij comes to Radomlje, with a new coach Robert Pevnik, who was on the bench in Radomlje only four months ago.",News/Reporting,train

293,"I am the mother of 21-month-old Rene, a very lively and persistent boy who loves to play football whenever and wherever possible. He is very playful, sociable, smiley, puts even the most serious and sad people in a good mood and captivates everyone who sees the sparkle in his eyes. Rene was born with a congenital deformity of the right leg called fibular hemimelia - a lack of the fibula bone that holds the foot and knee in the correct position. I found out about the deformity when I was pregnant, as I was regularly monitored in Ljubljana due to the loss of two children in previous pregnancies. Given the bad experiences I had had before, I was prepared for the worst-case scenarios, which fortunately did not materialise and Rene is otherwise perfectly healthy and without any other problems. At the moment we are solving the height difference with the help of adapted shoes and orthosis, which are regularly custom-made at the URI Soča in LJ, but this has become increasingly difficult since sometime in the new year, as the leg has become quite bent in the foot and knee due to the increased load. The doctor expects that walking with such a leg will soon be impossible and that Rene will end up in a wheelchair, and advises early surgical treatment. At the Orthopaedic Clinic in Ljubljana, where we have been treated since birth, they suggested amputation of the leg as the only possible solution. I got myself active online and on FB and got in touch with Dr Dror Paley, a doctor from the USA who has his own clinic in Florida. He has been dealing with fibular haemimelia for 30 years and has successfully operated on more than 200 such children. We visited him at the beginning of April and he promised us a full recovery. It takes 3 operations, which are recommended to be done at the age of 2 years, which together with rehabilitation and surgery to remove the fixator cost 180.000. There is a possibility of an operation in Milan and a follow-up in Florida, which would bring the total amount down a little. The date he proposed us is 20.6.2014. As Dr. Paley is only in Italy 1 x a year, we decided to try in every possible way to raise the necessary funds and catch the opportunity. I immediately submitted an application to the Health Insurance Fund, but the process is quite lengthy and, according to the experience of parents with similar problems, most of the time only partially approved, if at all.

And he said that he needed surgery on the tibia (shortening of the bone on one leg and that they would see him another time to find out exactly what the operation would be. At the second check-up in about two months. But at the second check-up it was the old doctor again... who just laughed at the opinion of the previous doctor... and said they would wait. Well, now it's been more than 10 years since then and this person doesn't even go for check-ups anymore, and there hasn't been any surgery either. Fortunately, it was not necessary. My mother is horrified at the thought that if the previous doctor had been back for a follow-up, the child might have been operated on.... <p/>I hope you have so much to take away that it is very clear what is really best for Rene. <p/> # 16 <p/> AMelaTalic <p/> 1 <p/> Apr 28, 2014 <p/> Ana: we also had a similar experience when we asked for an MRI, because of the ligaments and other things that are not visible on the X-ray pictures, and the doctor said that when he needed it, he would order it. :( And the ZZZS offered us 25€ to cover the examination in Belgium, which cost 500€ plus transport, accommodation,... <p/> A few years ago we were looking for a second opinion for our child abroad... it wasn't free, we had to pay for everything and when I told the doctor who arranged it all if we could get an opinion in Slovenian, she said if we paid extra. The state should be prepared to pay for such things. It pays for all sorts of nonsense... :( <p/> There is a page on fb for Rene.... (no, I didn't make it)... there will be everything you are interested in in several languages up there all the time. You can like, share, contribute with conversations, support, or just follow what's going on (to avoid misinformation, eh). Link: https: / / www.facebook.com / helpajmoreneu <p/> Hi, I'm AMela, mum from Rene. If you know anyone who would publish the story, I am willing to publish all the exams, especially the last one, in which we are advised amputation as the only treatment option! Also Paley's report, in which 100 guarantees a successful reconstruction of the leg. I cannot influence the opinion of the Health Insurance Fund, just as I cannot influence the opinion of the people, there are all sorts of us, but anyway, as far as I personally know parents with similar problems, none of them has managed to take advantage of it so far! This is yet another ugly innuendo circulating and smearing such campaigns. In any case, I doubt that anyone would publicly expose the results, their child, all their personal data, in order to then go on holiday to Hawaii. Children with special needs need a lot of money on a daily basis. I will give you a trivial example: we have one pair of shoes every 9 months paid for by the National Health Insurance Fund, and that is at an extra cost of 40! We still have the first adapted pair of shoes since birth, and the child is almost two years old! How many pairs of shoes have your children already changed in such a period, slippers, boots, etc.? ? Not to mention children who have more serious problems such as cerebral palsy and so on. If someone guarantees me from the ZZZS that they will pay all the costs of the operation (180.000) + rehabilitation + stay abroad + travel expenses, I sign immediately and I donate all the money that has accumulated so far at the same moment to the association Joyful Feet (children with cerebral palsy), or to some other child who needs an operation and is not covered by the ZZZS. I have a clear conscience, and I hope that others can say the same. I have been deciding to tell my story for a long time, having considered all the possible scenarios that could befall us in the meantime - from rejection, to partial co-financing, even daring to dream that there will be someone who will pay for everything and I will finally be able to breathe easy and take the next step without this financial burden standing around my neck. This is about a child, thank you to all of you who are helping us and who will continue to help us, and if anyone needs any more papers, documents, proof, my contact details, address, telephone, e-mail are posted above, I will send them without any problems. Greetings, AMela <p/> The whole process is described daily by my mum Amela on her fb wall. She also has all the documents, not me. The health service here would only cover an amputation, which is what she was advised. But for the surgery abroad, they are squinting and saying that she will get an answer in (the legally required? ) 60 days. And even that may only be a fraction, a percentage. As for the rest.... the campaign is in full swing, the blog is just my modest contribution to the mosaic. <p/> Give a little more information. There have been quite a few cases recently where parents had the option of covering the costs through the NHIF, but still raised the money and then spent people's contributions on "" their own "". To avoid this, I advise you to calm down a bit and try to publish as many documents as possible (refusals, decisions) so that people will dare to transfer money. If the case is really as you describe it, it is necessary to involve journalists and make the matter public (Tednik, for example). I write in good faith that something will come of it, otherwise nothing will! <p/> But would at least one of those who have 10 million in assets, or 5 million in cash in foreign banks and safe-deposit boxes (eh, Milan) at least donate 10,000 euros in aid? Will it work? It will be easier to croak. I guarantee him that he will die easier!",Forum,train

The investment consists of the redevelopment of the Cash & Carry store, worth 46,498,883 tolars, and the investment in the store equipment is 19,500,000 tolars. As we have assessed that no significant structural interventions are necessary in the existing building, only the partition walls between the supporting columns have been partially demolished in order to improve the visibility of the store. The Hura! discount store measures 1,035 m2, of which the sales area is 656 m2 and the rest consists of a warehouse, two cold stores, two cloakrooms, toilets, corridors and technical rooms. <p/> 50 parking spaces will be available for customers. <p/> The shop's opening hours will be from 8.00 to 20.00 Monday to Friday, from 8.00 to 17.00 on Saturdays and from 8.00 to 12.00 on Sundays in December. <p/> The following day, 16 December, the Hura! discount store will open its doors in Cerknica at 25 Cesta 4. maja.The investment in the Hura! discount store in Cerknica represents the redevelopment of the Mercator supermarket on the ground floor of the multi-storey building of the UE Cerknica, and its value amounts to 40,411,980 tolars, including equipment. The area of the Hura! discounter is 719 m2, of which 405 m2 is sales area, the rest consists of warehouses, separate changing rooms, toilets for employees, a cleaning room, an office and technical premises. <p/> There are 40 parking spaces in front of the shop. <p/> The shop's opening hours will be from 8.00 to 20.00 Monday to Friday, from 8.00 to 17.00 on Saturdays and from 8.00 to 12.00 on Sundays in December. <p/> Customers will be able to choose from more than 1,100 products from all product groups in both stores, with a larger selection of products in the beverages, basic foods, washing powders and stationery ranges. There will also be products from other product groups, such as packaged fresh meat and meat products, fruit and vegetables, packaged bread and bread products, sweet and savoury products, spices, personal care products, small animals, etc. <p/> Both the Hura! discount in Murska Sobota and the Hura! discount in Cerknica will have two cash registers equipped with a POS system, and customers will be able to pay with cash, debit cards and Mercator vouchers. <p/> The two stores will employ 6 people each, bringing the total number of employees in the Hura! discount chain to 27 since 9 September, when the first Hura! discount store in Ljubljana opened its doors. <p/> With the opening of Hura! discounters, Mercator is following the trends in retail development and, above all, the expectations of customers in the design of sales formats aimed at basic supplies. Market research on attitudes towards hard discounters shows that in all markets where Mercator already operates, a high proportion of customers are in favour of discounters. Based on these findings and the trends in the offer, we have assessed that there is potential for the development of this type of store format. We expect that the expansion of the Hura! discount retail chain in Slovenia in the next few years will lead to a significant market share among discount providers. The guiding principle behind the design of Hura! discounters is to offer customers quality products from lesser-known brands, the main characteristic of which is price competitiveness, while creating as simple, yet comfortable and friendly shopping environment for the customer as possible.",Information/Explanation,train

307,"Elvis Kudič, athlete (09 / 2013) <p/> When I first came to the Althea Centre, I was immediately taken care of. It all started with tap dancing, and then Nena and I talked about what I was training. I said athletics and that I was very scared of competitions, but Nena suggested mental training. After the first session I felt different, I have been doing it for a year now and the progress is very good (from 1 to 10 it's a 10! ). I am relaxed, confident, I have a goal in mind. Of course, there are still a lot of things to improve. I feel great in Althea. <p/> Kristina Novak, tennis player, 13 years old (09 / 2013) <p/> Filip Zupančič, tennis player (08 / 2012) <p/> I've had a lot of mental training, but none has been as reliable as the IMT® mental training at Althea®. During the training you relax (sometimes you almost fall asleep, although you are still fully concentrated) and when you wake up again you are full of energy. Nena and I have been working together for a little less than a year now and the results are obvious. I feel great even in the face of injuries, and I perform very confidently in tournaments. The exercises we do are reliable, they help me a lot. From my side that would be everything, I really recommend you if you have / will have any possible problem to come to Althea® and feel this great atmosphere. Filip <p/> Blaž Kavčič, top tennis player (07 / 2012) <p/> I first came into contact with the Althea® Health and Harmony Centre a little over two years ago when I had to put my best friend (tennis racket) in a corner because of a tear in the back of my leg. I was in great mental distress as no therapy was helping and I didn't know what to do. For a top athlete, there is nothing worse than having to lie down and rest... Since then, I have always turned to them when I am in trouble. <p/> As soon as I entered Althea I knew I had come to the right place. On the first day of therapy I was welcomed by a physiotherapist and her friend Tecar®. After just a few therapies I could feel a big difference. My leg was more relaxed and the pain slowly subsided, and soon I was able to return to the tennis courts again. But there was still one big problem... I couldn't put the same strain on my leg as before the injury and I felt I couldn't help it. I had a brake in my head ... <p/> That's when Nena came to my rescue. With IMT® training, we broke through the block in a few days and my movement on the court became much better and I felt I was the one on the court again, because it was very difficult to send the ball past me. Nena also taught me to listen to myself and my body. Now I can often help myself. <p/> I would like to thank everyone at Althea® from the bottom of my heart, because they have saved me many difficult days that I would have had to spend without tennis. Tecar®, Bionic®, IMT® and kinesiotaping is surely the best combination of therapies for injury recovery and I highly recommend Althea® to anyone who needs help. <p/> Blaž Kavčič <p/> Miran Stanovnik (28.5.2012, after his injury in Dubai, completion of therapy) <p/> After Miran's injury in Dubai, in addition to physiotherapy and kinesiotaping, we also did IMT® intuitive mental training and energy therapies as a support to the basic therapy, in order to speed up rehabilitation and to clean up the effects of the injury on all other levels, not only on the physical body. The following is a description of his experience, which was very powerful, because he gave himself completely to the therapy and his intention was to completely rehabilitate all the consequences (physical, mental, energetic) of this injury, as well as all the previous ones that had happened to him, in the shortest possible time, which is why the reaction was more intense and the result was extremely fast, which was his intention, which he had set for himself. <p/> Dear friends, My meetings with my pleasant and professional friends from the Althea® Centre in Lesce are coming to their final stage. The rehabilitation has more than succeeded. But I have tried something new again (at least for me). Nena kindly asked me if we could also try one energy therapy (reiki) together with IMT® mental training. Of course, why not. Of course I didn't expect any revolution, but I participated fully, like everything I do. She also warned me that I might get a little cold after the treatment because the energy would be cleansing... Well yes, it's no joke I can tell you that. I got so cold on the way home after the treatment that I set the internal temperature in my car to 28 degrees Celsius and it wasn't enough. At home I covered my head with two blankets (not duvets) and that was barely enough. But within an hour my body reacted with a fever (38 degrees). After a few hours I just lift my head and ask Nena for a commentary on the events. Such a strong reaction to everything we did, cleansing on all levels, because I was prepared for it and went into the process ""full on"", says my therapist. Yes, I spent a few more days in bed, but the very next day there was a significant improvement in the condition of the injury, and the very next day I forgot about the crutches for walking around the flat, which means that it helped, and since that day I have only used them for walking up the stairs... A crazy good experience, I tell you. Now I've read it again and I see that my writing looks terribly ""cracked"", but I'm not going to correct it, because everything I said is true. <p/> Miran <p/> Jure Robič, top extreme cyclist (09 / 2010) <p/> Dear Nena, I have been promising you for too long that I would write about how I experience our ""sessions"". Well, now I have made time for you, just as you have always made time for me whenever I need you, day or night. When I told you in the first session that I trusted you and believed in you and that you could do whatever you wanted, just to get better and get back to racing as soon as possible, I had no idea that change could be so fast and so effective. When you got me up and racing in four days after a serious injury, with the help of Bionic®, Tecar® and especially your IMT® mental technique, I started to understand why things were happening to me in the lake in the first place. A new world is really opening up for me, as you predicted. I know it's all in my head, it's just that now, with your help, I know how to put what's bothering me out of my mind. I can't wait for us to continue. See you)) <p/> Miran Stanovnik, top motorcyclist (07 / 2010) <p/> My first meeting with Nena and Althea® was the result of a conversation and a personal recommendation from Jureto (Robič), who couldn't praise the ""treatments"" enough. Despite the relatively long distance from my home, I regularly visited Althea® in Lesce when I had injuries, which are an integral part of almost every athlete's life. I have received individual massage treatment, Bionic® therapy, Tecar® therapy, as well as IMT® intuitive mental training, a method I am really enthusiastic about. The result was shockingly good for me. I don't bother with the details of how each segment works, because for me it's important that it works. And that is for sure. <p/> I did not believe in it at first, but then I was convinced by the real effects, and I was completely taken in. At the beginning, I thought, what is this going to do for me, how can this possibly work, this is just something, blah blah blah, ... but, as I said, I was fascinated by the effect. Every human being has certain blockages, unprocessed patterns, every human being has a problem somewhere - maybe they are aware of it, maybe they are not. Nena, I was taken by her very calmness, I felt that myself. She is a woman I trusted immediately. After giving birth, I had a big problem with iron. There was no way, even with medical help, that it would improve. Quite by chance, when I met Nena, I complained about the matter and she suggested that we look at where I might have a blockage, the psychological reasons that were causing it. Well, we did find the cause: I had a desperate guilty conscience because I wasn't with my daughter non-stop and all that was eating my iron, and when we looked at all these patterns of guilt, cleared them up, came to terms with it, when I looked the matter in the eye, it got abnormally better and better. During the Olympic Games in Vancouver, Nena and I spent a lot of time in contact via Skype. This IMT® mental training can also be done remotely, and she helped me to step over difficult mental barriers. I was able to. Sometimes you may think that the problem is somewhere on the surface, but when you look deep inside you realise that it's the patterns you have in you from childhood that are now ""jumping out"". I found myself in this IMT® training, in this therapy. It helps me a lot. It's not just a therapy for sport, it's a therapy that enriches me for life. I realise that I still have a lot of work to do on myself and this is a method where you can see the effect after just one therapy, you can see the progress, the change immediately. I recommend it to everyone who wants to be happy with themselves. For me, this therapy has opened my eyes, and I look at certain things with different glasses. I calm down when I have therapy with Nena, she calms me down, after all it is my time, which I spend on myself and enrich myself. <p/> Vasja Rupnik, biathlon team Slovenia (06 / 2010) <p/> I myself have never believed in intangible, unexplainable things, but after I started working with the Altheo® Centre, with Nena, I started to realise that it is only the ego that is the problem to a better and more confident performance in competitions, and in life! With the help of therapies, which are not even therapies, but a conversation, or with Nena's help, digging into your subconscious, you discover that fears and blockages are part of you, you just have to dare to discover them, to do that you need the desire for a better and easier life, of course, without Nena's help and guidance it's not possible, so thank you for the feedback and I recommend it for the future! <p/> Maja Kokol, children's presenter, animator and singer (05 / 2010) <p/> I have been dedicated to children in my work in various ways for 23 years. Working and socialising with them has confirmed to me over and over again how fairy-tale and magical this world is. That is why I believe in miracles, fairy tales and angels - Nena is certainly one of them. The severe trials, the extreme sadness and the fear of ""tomorrow"" are the circumstances that have brought her my way. I am a great optimist but I can say that without her help I would not have made it through that period - especially not in that way. Nena is not only a friend but also a great therapist who gives me energy, warmth, words... - whatever she feels I need at that moment. Because she is so visibly successful in all this, her ideas, advice or just telling me about something good always opens my heart and makes me curious - and so it was with the IMT® technique. She changed my life, completely - turned it upside down like a whirlpool, leaving behind the devastation of old patterns, thoughts, connections and sowing new seeds with a firm and determined will. That is why, my dear Nena, you are my angel - in all forms, in all areas. With your help, I have become who I am and for that I will always be grateful! <p/> Nika, tennis player (02 / 2011) <p/> IMT® therapy helps me with all the things I do, not just tennis. I have noticed much less fussing (if any) about others or about external things that I can't control. I am much more in touch with myself and my needs. I am somehow living more in a kind of ""peace"". At the beginning I had doubts in myself in terms of opening up. I am a person who finds it very difficult to trust someone completely and therefore to believe them. I have to say that I trusted you from the very beginning of our IMT® therapy, which is not typical for me. The therapies also help me in general in my life and are not only related to sports. In fact, for many years I lived in a bubble that I didn't want to get out of. Everybody could say or do anything to me, but I always acted completely calm on the outside. With your help, I am now actually speaking my mind, without fearing the outcome. I don't even think about what if it had been, or why it happened, but I live in the moment and do what needs to be done. My own execution, accuracy and power of my strokes has also improved with the IMT® therapies we do. <p/>Spella (12 / 2011) <p/>The barrel of repressed problems and fears has finally been filled. There was no more room and the eruption had to happen. For me as a psychological problem. I landed on antidepressants. But since I am still too young to walk with crutches (that's what doctors call treating mental problems with pills) I decided to take matters into my own hands. I knew that Nena had a health centre, but I had no idea how it could help me. But since the devil is still a fly in the ointment, I figured it couldn't get any worse and called her. We made an appointment for therapy. And lo and behold, after the very first IMT® session, I felt relief. A second one followed, and a third, ... Today I feel really great and I am eternally grateful to Neni. And yet more proof that the therapies really do help. One of my many fears was walking in the woods. I didn't go there alone if I could, even though I enjoy the woods. Every noise made me shiver, I was afraid of meeting a person, an animal... This fear of mine was rooted deep in my subconscious and stemmed from events in my past. After one of the therapies I went to the forest to test the effect. Alone. Amazing. The fear of forest visitors and the silence with the occasional rustling of leaves, wind, ... was gone. Walking means relaxation, recharging my batteries, talking to myself. <p/> Everything in life happens for a reason. Nena, you were one of the better and more beautiful ones. Thank you. I love coming back to therapy because it really helps me to understand what is going on around me. Therapies make my perception of the world more positive.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

We rented motorbikes and this is where our exploration of the island began. <p/> TRAFFIC In Thailand, traffic is on the left (as in England). We had rented a car earlier when we were in the north. At first, my father had problems driving. The steering wheel is on the right hand side and then everything else gets confused. When he wanted to turn on the indicator he turned on the windscreen wipers instead. Luckily we took the automatic, otherwise he would have had problems with the gearshift, because he was repeatedly looking for the lever on the right side, where the door was. <p/> I am quite an experienced ""motorcyclist"" myself. I've been driving my scooter around for about 4 years, so I took over as driver and drove my mum around. I thought that driving on the left side would be a bit of a hassle, but I got used to it quickly. I had more trouble parking in the garage.Almost everybody here drives motorbikes and then, of course, they have special garages for motorbikes. Other road users also gave me a bit more trouble. People overtake here on the left and right, sometimes elsewhere if they can. There are no rules, so you really have to be alert and careful for your own safety. <p/> SUN After a short sightseeing tour of the island, swimming followed. Almost all the beaches here are sandy and more crowded with sunbeds, umbrellas, etc. When you want to have a nice rest, there are already vendors from the ""shanties"" selling all kinds of things on the beach (watches, food, clothes... ). After a rest and a swim, we drove to a shopping centre a little further away. It was already really hot outside so I couldn't wait to see the cold shops. Trying on clothes in the mirror, I was surprised by the bright red colour of my hands, just like tomatoes. The sun was burning me badly. I must admit that I didn't put on much sunblock. My skin is naturally darker and I have a lot of pigment. As soon as the sunny days start I get a nice tan. I don't like to sunbathe and I know it's not healthy. I have never had problems with sunburn and that is why I am much more surprised. <p/> I was burnt on my arms (mainly because of the motorbike), shoulders, knees and of course the bottom of my legs. The sun is much stronger here than here and the change, when the body is not used to such a high amount of heat and sun, is also to blame for my severe burns, in addition to the fact that I didn't put enough sunscreen on. <p/> I was in for a hard, tiring night full of pain. Aloe Vera and menthol rubs, as well as after-sun creams and compresses, helped my recovery. Today I am much better and even the red colour has changed to a nicer, more tanned brown. <p/> From now on I will not go anywhere without sun cream and I will apply it much more often, because I am risking my life. A lot of times, the effects of the sun lead to skin cancer and also to more wrinkled and aged skin, and I don't want to have wrinkled skin at 18 and risk skin cancer!",Opinion/Argumentation,train

The National and University Library will also expand its archive of Slovenian websites to include all sites with the domain. si. <p/> Guest of Odbite is Janko Klasinc, librarian and web archivist at NUK. <p/> ""When the Library of Congress in the US started archiving, I remember people's reactions that it was total nonsense, why archive a few words about who eats what for breakfast. But it is important, in order to preserve the written heritage, that we also preserve things like that, not only the big, important, websites, but also social networks. ""Slovenia has chosen this way of preserving the web, following the example of foreign countries, and there are now more than 40 of them.

The biggest problem is selection, but they can do a lot if they archive all the pages with the registered domain. si. <p/> To capture, i.e. save, web pages, the NUK team is assisted by a robot called Heritrix, which captures all the content within a web page on a specific domain. The robot works in a similar way to the robots used by web browsers to index the web, such as Google, explained Janko Klasinc. <p/> But the most attention was drawn to NUK's news about storing tweets. It will work in a similar way to saving web pages. Don't worry, the archiving of tweets will be time-limited, i.e. the more important tweets will be saved over a certain period of time. Concerns about archiving tweets, Facebook statuses and web pages are redundant, Janko Klasinc points out.",News/Reporting,train
311,"Fortunately, the penultimate day of the year passed without any major events. <p/> Seven traffic accidents occurred on the roads of the Celje region in the last 24 hours, but fortunately for the participants, all of them resulted in material damage to the vehicles and objects involved. Police officers detained three drivers of motor vehicles overnight for drink-driving. <p/> Police intervention for breaches of public order was required in 12 cases during the day, eight of which were in a public place.

December is proverbially considered to be the busiest month of the year, but we can say that this weekend, despite the holidays and the resulting higher traffic density on our roads, did not stand out from the average. There was only one road accident resulting in serious injuries and two road accidents, two of which resulted in minor injuries to four occupants. 15 road accidents resulted in damage to property. Over the weekend, 19 drink-drivers were detained. <p/> A traffic accident with serious injuries occurred on Friday at 19:30 on Franja Malgaja Street in Šentjur. A 50-year-old driver was driving a car on Franja Malgaja Street in Šentjur, from the direction of Leona Dobrotinška Street towards II. Bataljona. As he drove his vehicle to the intersection with Gajstova cesta into a sharp right-hand bend, at the end of the bend he drove his vehicle too close to the right-hand edge of the carriageway and collided with a 63-year-old pedestrian, who was walking from the opposite direction, along the left-hand edge of the carriageway. After the collision, the pedestrian, who was wearing dark clothing, fell on the bonnet of the car and hit his head on the windscreen, after which he fell on the road and was seriously injured. The driver, who was driving a car without a valid driving licence, did not stop at the scene of the accident but drove off to an unknown destination, but later turned himself in at Šentjur police station. <p/> Crime continues.

While cutting down a tree, the tree snapped in half and buried a 60-year-old local resident underneath.",News/Reporting,train
316,"Responsibility, in my view, should not only mean that they can (or even should) make decisions for the child, but above all that their decisions should be responsible, sensible and beneficial for the child's development. Also in the SSKJ, responsibility is defined (among other things) as a quality, a characteristic of that which, because of its importance, its consequences, requires great knowledge, care, and as an attitude in which someone has to give an explanation, a justification for their work, their actions Responsibility is therefore given to someone because it is assumed that they have the knowledge and the ability to do the ""right"" thing with the thing, the task, entrusted to them. The power that parents are given is not supposed to be given in itself, but because they know how to make better choices. Such responsibility is undoubtedly stressful for a parent. After all, most parents want the best for their children, but it is difficult for them to know what is really best for the child. So my mother wanted more dolls when she was a child and now she is stocking her daughter with dolls so that she does not feel frustrated. What may not be realised is that her daughter does not like dolls at all. <p/> The decision-making power that comes as a package with parental responsibility often grates on the nerves of various experts. Parents can decide whether to allow the school doctor to carry out a systematic check-up with the school doctor at all. Parents can decide whether or not their child can see the school counsellor (the exception, of course, is acute situations that need to be dealt with immediately - e.g. fights between children, extreme abuse of classmates or teachers, disruption of classes). Parents decide whether or not the doctor can treat their child. Parents decide whether or not the child can see a psychologist. All this power is great, of course, as long as parents really work with it in the child's best interests. But, unfortunately, this often does not seem to be the case. <p/> At school, for example, the child is highly socially anxious, unself-conscious, unaccepted by his classmates, and often finds it difficult to come to school. Teachers notice this problem and find it most useful to have the child see a school counsellor to develop social competences, to try to develop a better self-image. But the parents say no. Our child is not like that already. But at home he is normally talkative. The school has nothing to interfere in our family. <p/> Similar situation. At the age of three, the entire population of children in Slovenia undergoes a systematic psychological examination. This screening identifies both children who show mental disorders and children who are at high risk of developing neurotic disorders or maladjustment. Of course, not all children identified as being at risk will necessarily develop disorders. But the results of this screening have fairly good predictive validity. The prediction that the developmental trajectory of children identified as at-risk will be towards a neurotic structure is therefore true with a high probability. The psychologist therefore identifies a child as being at risk and suggests a form of follow-up treatment. If the parents do not want this treatment, it will not be given. And a child whose adverse developmental course could be reversed at the age of three may be a behaviourally problematic toddler at the age of ten, getting on the nerves of his parents and even more so of the school. Perhaps, of course, it is not necessarily nothing. But it is better to work preventively on a larger number of children than to have to take curative action when it is actually too late. And if someone has to finish his personality development later as an adult with a psychotherapist, this development will take somewhere around twice as long as it would have taken if it had been carried out normally in childhood. <p/> Parents thus have almost godlike powers over their children's development, and the various experts can only oppose them when the parents are very clearly endangering the child's health or life. The latter is difficult to prove, especially when the threat is not physical but psychological. And practically impossible when it comes to matters such as potentially risky personal development, which is ultimately only potential.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
318,"In every profession there are people who are more and those who are less friendly. But when dealing with customers, you should not be unfriendly, arrogant or even rude. Nurses come top in these qualities (in my experience). From the fact that one nurse, during the driving test, tried every means to convince me that I was anaemic - she did not even ask me if I was, which is what she said: ' You are anaemic, you are so anaemic. ' And she did not give up even after several assurances that I was not anaemic. Apparently it is difficult to understand that blond and blue-eyed people also tend to have less pigment in their skin. The height of rudeness is the nurse at my gynaecologist's (a woman who the whole medical establishment knows to be a tease), who gives you a hard time whether you do anything wrong or not. The desire to get a prescription for the pill on a day when they are working with normal clients and not with students is utopian with her. If you explain to her nicely that you are studying more than 100 km away and that you cannot come on a specific day, she tells you to go and see the man on duty on Saturday. That's logic for you. Also, as a student, I can only get an appointment over the phone on Monday (that's the day they have reserved for female students), not any other day of the week. Someone please explain this to me. <p/>The waiters have been in a bad mood for the last week. First I get several accusatory no's because I want to order food that is out of stock (how was I supposed to know it was out of stock! ? ! ), then my classmate and I are told to get our own Coke from the fridge. Serving at the table is obviously a utopia. Whereupon we are given glasses full of limescale, which they refuse to change because apparently they can't be washed any nicer. But I wash the glasses by hand and they are never full of limescale. Then, suddenly, a waiter thinks that rum tea is great if you make it with black tea. Well, it's not great, and I have used an extravagant amount of sugar to make it edible at all. How a waitress who cannot make either can work in a bar where there is a big sign outside saying mulled wine and hot chocolate, and who cannot make either remains an enigma to me. Especially since at least mulled wine is very easy to make ... <p/> Certain people think that customers need to understand that they are having a bad day. Unfortunately, I have never considered that to be the customer's task. If I myself am polite and friendly and don't complicate things (except in extreme situations), I expect kindness in return. Or at least the absence of unkindness. Not unnecessary complication, nagging and insults. Because I believe that these same run-of-the-mill nurses and waiters would not find it acceptable if one day they came to see me as a client (e.g. in my capacity as a psychotherapist or clinical psychologist) and I was rude to them because I was just having a bad day. No matter how difficult it may be, worries should be left at home, or at least not shaken at clients.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
319,"Three Men in a Boat, not to mention the dog, is definitely one of the most entertaining books I've ever read. Jerome Flap Jerome hooks the reader right from the start. After all, a story about three hypochondriacs cannot be boring. And so what when someone has every known disease in this world, except the knee of a snapper. Jerome concluded something like this: ' At first I was quite hurt by it, it seemed like a kind of insult. Why don't I have a knee? Why this unjust neglect? But after a while, less British feelings prevailed. I said to myself: I have all the other diseases known to pharmacology and, becoming less selfish, I decided that I would get along without a knee. Gout had apparently attacked me in the worst possible form, and without realising it gallstones had apparently plagued me from a young age. After the gallstones, there was no more illness, so I decided that there was nothing else wrong with me.'<p/> So the three friends set off on a 'boating' trip down the Thames, peppered with all the adventures that can befall a traveller. And many astute observations - such as why women shouldn't pull boats, or what happens to ladies who go on picnics in their best dresses.

322,"Sculpture <p/> 13.03.2014 <p/> by Gregor Šket <p/> A sensual body, full curves, a carefully calculated geometry based on the ellipse. A long nose that hides something strong and big inside. The nostril flirts with infinity without beginning or end. The rear is elegantly muscular and subtly erotic. Technique: sculpture in iron, dimensions: 4453x1657x1273 mm, by Sir William Lyons, Malcom Sayer, William M. Heynes, vintage: 1961-1974. This is what it says on the plaque marking one of their greatest exhibits, a four-wheeled sculpture, the Jaguar XKE, E-Type, in the department of MoMA, New York's Museum of Modern Art. And MoMA only has six cars: a jeep willis, a Smart, a Cistalia 202 GT, a Ferrari Formula 1 641/2, a Volkswagen Beetle and the Jaguar e-type, which was added to the collection in 1996. <p/> But it has been clear since its birth that the e-type is a speciality that is actually much more than just a car. After all, Enzo Ferrari knew it as soon as he saw it. It wasn't easy for him. He must have swallowed his saliva with great difficulty, but sportingly admitted: ""This is the most beautiful car ever made! ""It is hard to imagine how much strength and trampled pride it took for the great Il Commendatore to pay such a flattering tribute to a car that was not from the Apennine Peninsula but from the British Isles. Somehow, he was saying what has always been known anyway: with all due respect to the Germans, only the Apennine Peninsula and the British Isles can make really good supercars. From today's point of view, the irony is that series production of cars in both centres of super-sport has virtually come to a standstill, or at least is in a very difficult situation that smacks of perpetual decline. <p/> A symbol of the 1960s <p/> At the end of the 1950s, following their success at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Jaguar's engineers, developers and designers were tasked with creating an all-new sports two-seater to replace the legendary XK150. In 1957, the E1A prototype was created, but it was only available for factory testing. Three years later, the E2A prototype followed and achieved some racing success. When the carpet was unveiled at a press conference at the Parc des Eaux Vives restaurant in Geneva on 15 March 1961, the gathering was breathless. In front of them stood a piece of automotive art which, for the time, represented the very avant-garde, a glimpse of the future, something unseen, something new... The Jaguar XKE, also known as the e-type. Interestingly, they had no special plans for the newcomer, but rather than sales success, they were counting on racing victories. But it turned out the other way round. Although the XKE was initially intended only for export to the North American market, it was also unexpectedly popular and in demand at home. It also convinced with its relatively affordable price of £2,256 at the time (around £38,000 today, or around €45,000). Of course, it was soon behind the wheel of many movie and sports stars of the 1960s, such as George Best, Brigitte Bardot, Tony Curtis, Steve McQueen, etc. <p/> Designed by an aeronaut <p/> The e-type's design is by designer Malcom Sayer. As an aeronautical engineer, he was of course a master of aerodynamics. And this is probably the main reason why the e-type offered a design that was revolutionary for its time and remarkably modern. At first sight, the car was a sight to behold, with a virtually perfect shape. The side view revealed a cigar-shaped form, dominated by a long bonnet that flowed into a relatively short cabin. From any angle, the E-type reveals the designer's remarkable sense of aesthetics, proportion, right angles and proportions. Its rear end evokes feminine curves, its front end may look like a shark, but in its aggressiveness it exudes something friendly, soft, warm, almost childlike. All accentuated by thoughtful chrome detailing and typical English wheels made of interwoven spokes. Inside, it's a sort of miniature sexy English saloon - leather seats, leather steering wheel, classic switchgear and dashboard gauges. <p/> Three body styles and three series <p/> The E-type was initially available as a two-door coupe, known as FHC (Fixed Head Coupe), and as a convertible, known as OTS (Open Two Seater). A few years later, the 2+2 coupe was launched. The coupe was lengthened by about 20 centimetres and two makeshift rear seats were added to allow four adult passengers to ride in the e-type. At first glance, the 2+2 Coupe does not have the same harmonious lines and angles of the exterior. Connoisseurs say the cabin sticks out too much and, above all, the side lines are not as elegant. <p/> The e-type was initially powered by a 3.8-litre six-cylinder engine, which was replaced by a 4.2-litre unit in 1964. Both engines gave the car superb driveability. The speedometer only stopped at 240 kilometres per hour, and it accelerated to 100 km/h in seven seconds. <p/> It also underwent a few cosmetic changes during the 13 years of series production, during which 70,000 examples were built. In 1968, the Series 2 was launched, distinguished on the outside mainly by slightly different tail lights hidden under the bumpers, and on the inside by different switches on the dashboard. In 1971, the 3 Series was launched, which introduced a 12-cylinder 5.3-litre engine and was also quite different externally. Unfortunately, even at that time, the rule was that cosmetic changes were really a deterioration. The 3 Series E-type no longer had such a friendly bonnet, its front end was no longer classic Jaguar, but had a few Citroën elements. The side line was also spoilt, as the E-type had its front wings opened up too much. In fact, the third series heralded the arrival of the all-new XJ-S, which arrived just a year after the e-type's retirement, but was in no respect even close to its predecessor. <p/> Auto-erotic <p/> The E-type is one of the few cars whose physical presence evokes purely non-automotive emotions. It feels like a sculpture on four wheels. As such, it is, of course, a remarkable example of industrial design and therefore, of course, it has a special place in the history of both motoring and design. There are few examples where these two worlds intertwine, intersect and interact so effectively and, above all, so seamlessly. <p/> That's why, half a century after its birth, it is still one of the most beautiful cars in the world. The Daily Telegraph has listed it as one of the 100 most beautiful cars in the world, and Sports Car International magazine has ranked it number one in a similar list. Right, because the e-type is a cross between a car, eroticism and art...",Promotion,train

We try to fill each day with as many interesting activities as possible. We like to invite guests and volunteers to join us. <p/> So we relaxed in the company of guitarist Juret Jahn, who played us some popular party tunes and some songs from different historical periods. It was the first time we had listened to such a challenging programme played on the guitar and we were more than surprised. During the lecture by the athlete Mitya Duh, we learnt a lot about running and healthy living, and were inspired by his energy for life. Volunteer Špela Natek visited us and introduced us to a new way of making corrugated cardboard boxes. The boxes and all our other products are available at the Trbovlje market stall once a month. <p/> We organised three swimming trips, which would not have been possible without the generous support of our donors. We would like to thank Thermana d.d., Dobrega počutja Laško, Rimski Terme d.o.o. and ZPO Celje d.o.o. for the donation of the swimming tickets. <p/> On a sunny Friday in July, the premises of the Day Centre were filled with competition fever, as a large number of us took part in a darts tournament.

324,"Yeah, I find it ugly too that I have to explain why I'm single, I just haven't found a guy yet who doesn't enjoy sex.Since I don't really enjoy sex at all I don't think it's anything special as far as I've gotten to know it so far.Otherwise I'm not of the engaging variety it's hard to find a thing that engages me that only the male organ does.Yes it's possible that there's stress in between but at the same time I don't see myself tied down and let's say married <p/> You're ""lucky"" that ONLY the male sex organ engages you. I get it all the time (doolg). Finding an asexual partner is also difficult, I think, because a lot of them wouldn't admit to being that way for the world. <p/> Yes it is true that men's pride suffers when they admit it.I myself have a great desire to become a mother one day but again my orientation or sense of sexuality is the problem.How will I become a mother if I don't enjoy sexual pleasures <p/> I guess it will depend on what kind of relationship you have with the man you are going to be a couple with. I didn't find it difficult at first because I was very much in love. That's why I have two children anyway. I didn't feel physical pleasure, but the emotional closeness was a good balance. But when the love died, I couldn't even kiss anymore. In the last few years, I can't even imagine touching anymore. Hugging a friend - that's still a thing. But the rest of it eludes me. I'm not happy that it's like this, but you get used to it (what else is there to do) and you get used to it. <p/> Sorry, maybe you didn't mean it that way, but that's what I think is wrong. Knowing that you don't want a long term partnership and sex, but still finding someone and lying to them until you get pregnant is just not OK. Pippa's case is ok because she only found out later and did not knowingly lie - and she and her ex-partner probably suffered a lot during the divorce. I understand where you are coming from, because it does not seem fair to me either that I will probably not be able to have a 'normal' family and children. But even heterosexual people often have problems finding a suitable partner. But you can use knowing yourself and your expectations to create the kind of relationship you really want. If you find an asexual partner or donor, you can also get pregnant without direct sexual contact. <p/> Yeah, the donor option is also an option and it's probably going to have to be a bit over the pond when the clock is ticking because I really want to be a mum one day and yeah, it would be really nasty to have a boyfriend just to get pregnant, so I'm really going to have to get into action in a couple of years and find an asexual partner to get emotionally involved with or a donor <p/> Yeah, it's really difficult and I guess if I find a man to live with I'd have to have the talk.But most of all I want to have a child in a few years time without having to have sex.I am fed up of telling my mum that I only see myself with a child without a man maybe that sounds selfish to have a child without a father so the real one gets a boyfriend go to bed when you get pregnant get rid of him.She doesn't even understand that I am repulsed by the thought of having sex <p/> It doesn't sound selfish to me. There have always been single women who have been without a man. If they can take good care of a child, then I don't think it's selfish. What I think is selfish is lying to your partner and only being with him until you get pregnant. <p/> white wrote: <p/> She doesn't even understand that the thought of sex is repulsive to me <p/> Maybe she should talk to her mother. Mine took time to accept me though. However, she is now OK with the idea that I am asexual and that I don't want a sexual partnership. I also want to have a child and I don't know how that will happen one day. But I don't bother about that. It will be what it will be. <p/> Yes, it really doesn't make sense to lie to a man just to get pregnant.In my own words, my greatest wish is to become a mother without having to go to bed and to raise a child on my own, otherwise a woman can play the role of both mother and father <p/> Yes, it is really unpleasant if parents have their own views on parenting and I know how it is for a child if he doesn't know which way to go with whom he should stick with.I am single and probably will be single with a child I have already looked into the possibility of insemination without intercourse a little and it looks good so when the time comes I will be able to have a child.Just today my mother shocked me by saying that I should bring a boyfriend to a party in six months so that I won't be a black sheep in the eyes of my relatives, so that I can say I have a boyfriend just to shut them up <p/> Just today my mother shocked me by saying, that I should bring a boyfriend to a party in six months' time so that I won't be a black sheep in the eyes of my relatives, so that I can say I have a boyfriend just to shut them up <p/> Sad. Obviously your mum cares more about what people will think of you (and your mum) than what you really want. Social pressures are a terrible thing and I hope you manage to stay true to yourself.

335,"IAC and the Coggins test <p/> For those of you who take your horse to competitions, shows or other events where large numbers of horses gather, you will have heard of IAC. An IAC test is usually required to enter competitions, and sometimes to transport horses to a new stable, when a horse changes ownership... <p/> But do you know what the acronym IAC stands for, and why it is so important to have a test to prove that a horse is not infected? <p/> Introduction IAC is an acronym for I nfectious a nemio k onj, a viral disease that is in many ways related to the disease known as AIDS. <p/> In both cases, it is a viral disease for which there is neither a vaccine nor a cure. Although most infected horses quickly succumb to the disease, a small percentage of affected horses make at least a semblance of a recovery, but these same horses still carry the virus and become ill again when they are subjected to greater strain or stress. It is precisely because some horses look healthy despite carrying the virus that testing is needed to show the true picture of the horse's health. This also ensures the safety of all horses in the same stable, in the same pasture ... <p/> Transmission Recently, research has revealed new findings in the field of transmission of this disease. The disease is mainly transmitted by blood-sucking insects (hookworms, flies, mosquitoes ... ). For example, if an infected horse is bitten by an adder and then by a healthy horse, the disease is transmitted from one to the other. The virus only survives in the mealworm for a short time (15-30 minutes), so the disease is usually spread between horses that are housed close to each other, e.g. in the same stable or pasture. The disease occurs wherever horses and bloodsucking insects are present. <p/> Clinical signs In equine infectious anaemia, there are three groups of symptoms: acute symptoms, chronic symptoms and latent carrier symptoms, which are barely noticeable or absent. <p/>Acute symptoms include fever, listlessness, lack of running. It is difficult to diagnose an acute horse as the symptoms are generalised and the IAC test will not be positive for a month and a half after infection. About one third of infected horses with acute signs die within a month. <p/> Chronic symptoms include recurrent short acute periods with weight loss, swollen abdomen and legs and anaemia. The horses will test positive for IAC. In this condition, the horse may last for several years before the disease finally debilitates it. <p/> Most asymptomatic infected horses will show no recognisable signs of infection but will test positive on the Coggins test. <p/> Coggins test To ensure that a horse is not carrying the IAC virus, a simple test called the Coggins test is performed. This test checks whether antibodies to IAC are present in the horse's blood. Blood samples must be examined by an authorised laboratory. This test is often needed at competitions and transport events and is the simplest way of proving that your horse is healthy and is not a threat to the health of other horses at the event. <p/> Once you have passed the Coggins test, there is no need to repeat it just to keep calm. Your horse will not be IAC positive unless it shows serious signs of illness after contact with another horse whose IAC status you do not know. Further IAC tests should only be carried out for the purposes of the situations described above (competitions, shows, transport... ). <p/> Prevention With the blood testing programme and the required tests at major events, the number of cases of infection has been drastically reduced. When the testing programme started, it was believed that this approach would even eradicate the disease completely, but there are just so many asymptomatic carriers each year that the disease still occurs. There is no vaccine for IAC. It is therefore important to ensure that your horse and the horses it comes into contact with are tested and that they test negative. More and more horse boarding providers are requiring an IAC test for all newly arrived horses, which certainly goes a long way in preventing the spread of the disease. If you have horses in your care in stables or on pasture, require an IAC test from all new horses coming into your care. <p/> One more piece of information for anyone interested in having an IAC test: the Coggins test is carried out at the Equine Veterinary Clinic in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the price of the rapid test (results in one day) is €25, while the normal test (results in six days) costs a little less. The IAK test is valid for one year in Slovenia. <p/>Shops and services",Information/Explanation,train

339,"Friday 01 August 2008 <p/> This autumn there will be elections to the National Assembly. Therefore, in the first half of June, we sent a questionnaire to the parliamentary parties asking about their attitude towards family policy, the work they have done so far and their plans or promises for the new mandate in this area, as well as their opinion on some concrete proposals of the Family Initiative. We asked the parties to return the questionnaires to us by the end of June. <p/> Only the NSi group sent us a fully completed questionnaire within the deadline. They expressed their support for most of our proposals and listed several solutions they had proposed and implemented during the current mandate. In addition to the more high-profile ones, which you are probably all familiar with, let me mention two less well-known ones, such as the 50 per cent reduction in the contribution for the use of public roads for families with four or more children and the abolition of the administrative fee for marriage. The fact that these are not just words is borne out by the experience of this term, when the NSi Group of Deputies has repeatedly asked us for our opinion or for consultation, and our proposals have been taken on board, at least to some extent. Of course, we would have been even happier if there had been more of this. <p/> The second and so far last questionnaire was sent to us by the LDS. The questionnaire is only partially filled in and considerably less specific. For the most part, they did not really say anything about the specific proposals of the Family Initiative, with the predominant answer being ""it is interesting, needs to be changed, and then maybe worth supporting"", with the feasibility mostly based on the constraints of public finances, and with quite a few of the proposals they also made it clear that they did not support them. Interestingly, despite the fact that they have had the scissors and the canvas for 12 years and that the situation has not deteriorated in recent years (in some areas it has improved), they are very critical of the current state of family policy. <p/> We were also promised a questionnaire by the SLS, but have not received it to date. They have repeatedly shown their support for pro-family solutions in the past and have proposed some of their own. We hope that they will also send us something more concrete as soon as possible. <p/> The SD referred us to their alternative government programme, which is quite interesting reading in some points and also promises some of the solutions that the Family Initiative has been pointing out for quite a number of years. In some areas they advocate completely opposite proposals, and in others the text is quite intangible. Caution in reading it is warranted by past experience, because when the party had significant influence in government for a number of years, there was no real will and no real listening to the same proposals. You can find the programme on the SD website. <p/> Lipa has sent us its statutes and programme, and has promised an electoral programme. The party programme received contains very little that is tangible, and not much space is given to parents and the family. Perhaps the electoral programme will be something more concrete. <p/> Sunday 22 June 2008 <p/> This autumn there will be elections for Members of the European Parliament. A significant part of our electorate are parents, and so their attitudes, plans and work on family policy so far are also important to us when choosing parties and candidates for the parliament. <p/> The Family Initiative, the Association for a Family Friendly Society, is a non-partisan association of parents and friends of families that has been working for the best possible position of families in Slovenian society for 10 years. During this time, several governments have changed and we have held a critical mirror up to all of them, proposing the best possible solutions, opposing the bad ones, praising the good ones... This has certainly been the best demonstration of our professionalism and party independence, which is why our membership has been growing. <p/> Before the 2008 elections, we would like to ask all parliamentary parties about their attitudes to family policy, what they have done in the past (you know, actions count for more than promises) and what they intend to do in the next parliamentary term, if the electorate entrusts you with the leadership of the country. <p/> That's why we have contacted all political parties and asked them to fill in a questionnaire on their attitudes towards family policy. Once we have compiled the results, we will also present them to the public. For those parties that do not respond, we will assume that they are not interested or do not consider this area worthy of attention. <p/>Family Initiative hopes that the questionnaire has been / will be accepted by the parties as an opportunity to present their programme and plans in a concrete way.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

341,"Friday 29 December 2006 <p/> In December 2006, on the margins of the European Social Platform meeting at the Grand Hotel Union in Ljubljana, representatives of the Family Initiative met with Mr William Lay, Executive Director of COFACE - Confédération des Organisations Familiales de l'Union Européenne, or in Slovene the Confederation of Family Organisations of the European Union. We presented to Mr Lay the state of family policy in Slovenia and the efforts of the Family Initiative to develop family-friendly legislation in Slovenia. We presented the current proposals and initiatives for legislative change in Slovenia that we have prepared in the Family Initiative. We presented proposals to increase the competitiveness of parents in the labour market, proposals to improve the conditions for families with several children in the area of childcare, proposals to amend pension legislation and proposals for a fairer distribution of the costs of childcare between parents and individuals without children. The overall conclusion of the participants was that the Family Initiative is working on proposals that are also relevant for other members of the European Alliance. On the other hand, we can better draw on experience from abroad to identify family policy measures that have already shown results there. Family policy is implemented in each Member State separately and in a disconnected manner, and the European Union does not have a common family policy. For this reason, NGOs working to improve family policy in individual countries have joined together to form a common organisation, COFACE. So far, there has been no Slovenian representative in this organisation. That is why Mr Lay invited the Family Initiative to take an active part in this association. Those present agreed that membership in this organisation would be beneficial for both the Family Initiative and family policy in Slovenia. We believe that the benefits of membership would also justify the additional costs associated with membership. We parted with the hope of meeting next time as full members of COFACE, and thus to work together on family policy in the European Union. <p/> Thursday 12 October 2006 <p/> The coalition groups listened to the warnings of the Family Initiative that the proposed Income Tax Law, in the article providing for tax relief for dependent children, should be amended so as not to worsen the relative position of parents compared to taxpayers without children. Based on our warnings, the NSi, SDS and SLS groups of MEPs have drafted amendments to correct the draft law. In the course of the coordination with the Ministry of Finance, it was finally decided to amend the Bill by increasing the progressivity step of the tax relief from the third child onwards from EUR 748 to EUR 1500. While this solution does not meet the full requirements of the Family Initiative, it does address the main anomaly and shortcoming of the proposed law. For a number of families, the proposal will also not only maintain, but even slightly improve their relative position compared to taxpayers with the same income without children. <p/> Compared to the original proposal of the Family Initiative, the State will now make some savings and we expect that this will make it easier to implement other, perhaps even more important, family policy measures, such as incentives for parents to take up employment after the return of parental leave and part-time work. <p/> At this point, I would like to commend the cooperation of the expert colleagues of the NSi and SDS Groups of Members of the European Parliament and of some of their MEPs, who, during the negotiations with the Ministry of Finance, also checked the proposals and solutions they discussed with us, thus enabling us to participate constructively in this process with our own calculations and assessments. <p/> Tuesday, 30 May 2006 <p/> On World Family Day in May, we held a well-attended round table discussion at the General Assembly entitled The fertility problem between parents and the state, which was attended by the Minister of Finance, Dr Andrej Bajuk, the State Secretary at the Ministry of Education and Science, Dr Magdalena Šverc, the Director of the Directorate for the Family at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Development, Ms Majda Erzar, and the Acting Head of the Housing Sector at the Ministry of the Interior, Ms Anita Hočevar Frantar. The round table and its content were reported in most media. <p/> Thursday, 01 December 2005 <p/> The Family Initiative wrote to Prime Minister Janez Janša on 4 November 2005 asking for a discussion on measures to increase the birth rate and improve the situation of families, and the context of the proposed reforms from the perspective of parents and families. <p/> On 25.11.2005 we received a rather vague reply from the Prime Minister's Office.",News/Reporting,train
342,"Request for an interview <p/> Dear Mr President! <p/> When you presented your government programme, you listed among the most important priorities of this government the concern to increase the birth rate and to improve the situation of families, since the severely low birth rate is currently the biggest structural problem of our country. <p/> Since 1997, we parents, associated in the Family Initiative, an association for a family-friendly society, have been working towards these very goals, and we were very pleased to see this new direction in Slovenian politics. Over the years we have been working in the field of family policy, we have accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience, and have proven ourselves with valid and well-founded proposals and reasoned debate, free from emotional and populist exaggerations. We have always chosen dialogue with the relevant authorities as our primary mode of action, because we believe above all in the power of argument. <p/> It is obvious that parents all over Slovenia have accepted the Family Initiative as a credible advocate of their needs and rights, as the number of our members is steadily growing (we are now about 1,000), and the wider circle of friends of the Family Initiative is even much larger, as in 2004, for example, in just a few days, we collected more than 13,000 signatures on the initiative for a preliminary legislative referendum on the proposal for a law on personal income tax, which was intended by the previous government to reduce the tax deductions for larger families. <p/>With our expertise and experience, we are ready to help make the legislative changes and reforms needed to create an environment in which parents feel more comfortable in their parenting role than they do today, and therefore make more and better parenting choices. <p/> We would therefore like to meet with you to discuss your plans to implement the above-mentioned priority of the Government this term and how the Family Initiative could help. This is particularly important at a time when important reforms are being adopted to improve the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy, and we have not found much in the documents on the proposals for these reforms, at least so far, that is tangible on how to tackle the problem of low fertility and on the above-mentioned priority and task of the Government in this mandate. The question also arises as to how these orientations are reflected in the 2006 and 2007 budgets.",Other,train
343,"Wednesday 30 November 2005 <p/> Allow me to begin by briefly introducing myself. The Family Initiative is an association of parents in particular, which has been working since 1997 (and formally since 1998) for legislative solutions to improve the comparative position of parents and families. In the past, we have been more concerned with preventing changes that would worsen the situation of parents and families than with improving legislation. Over the years we have worked in the field of family policy, we have accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience and have proven ourselves through sound and well-founded proposals and reasoned debate, without emotional and populist exaggerations. We have always chosen dialogue with the relevant authorities as our primary mode of action, because we believe above all in the power of argument. <p/> It is obvious that parents all over Slovenia have accepted the Family Initiative as a credible advocate of their needs and rights, as the number of our members is steadily growing (we are now about 1,000), and the wider circle of friends of the Family Initiative is even much larger, as in 2004, for example, in just a few days, we collected more than 13,000 signatures on the initiative for a preliminary legislative referendum on the proposal for a law on personal income tax, which was intended by the previous government to reduce the tax deductions for larger families. <p/> We are following with interest the debates and your documents on reforms to improve the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy. Of course, we are trying to get a picture of how the whole set of reforms will affect the situation of parents and families. To analyse the impact of the various legislative proposals on family benefits and taxes, we have developed computer simulation tools some time ago, which we are continuously upgrading and adapting to new proposals. We can say that our calculations have proven to be correct in the past. When we try to process your reform proposals in a similar way, we are faced with the problem of the lack of concrete data and figures that are necessary to carry out the calculations and, ultimately, to reproduce and verify the calculations that have already been presented so far. <p/> Moreover, the data already presented on some of the proposals show that, if they are not implemented in the right way, they could be quite harmful to families, especially families with several children. In our view, it would not be necessary to interfere with the concept of the reforms if they were to be implemented in a way that would also be acceptable or beneficial, or at least harmless, from the point of view of parents and families. <p/> With our knowledge and experience, we are ready to help in the preparation of reforms that will contribute to creating an environment in which parents feel more comfortable in their parental role than they do today, and therefore prefer and choose parenthood more often, because we agree with the Prime Minister who, when presenting the Government's programme, said that the severely low birth rate is currently the biggest structural problem in our country. <p/> We are therefore asking for a meeting to review together what is proposed in concrete terms (with the necessary figures) by the reforms, so that we can use simulation calculations to see what this means for parents and families and where the proposals might need to be adjusted. Given that you have said publicly that you lack simulation tools, it may be interesting for you to see what we have produced and how much it could be useful for you.",Other,train
344,"Wednesday 13 April 2005 <p/> At the very beginning of the new government's term of office, in anticipation of a change in the attitude of the state towards parents and families, we prepared a comprehensive review of the measures we believe are necessary to make parents in Slovenia feel more comfortable in their parental role and therefore more willing and able to take on this mission. We have sent the document entitled ""For a more vibrant Slovenia"" to all ministries with a major role in family life and to some of the MPs who have asked us to do so. The Ministry of the Environment sent us a written reply, the Ministry of Education invited us for a discussion, and the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs (MoLFSA), in its Directorate for the Family, held several discussions on the subject. At the Ministry of Finance (MoF), we were more or less ignored. The proposed measures were also material for discussion at the meeting to which we were invited by the NSi MEPs. <p/> Wednesday, 27 September 2000 <p/> In the run-up to the elections, we in the Family Initiative took stock of the family policy in the outgoing mandate and presented it to the public at a press conference on 26 September 2000. Some of the media reported on it, but some ignored it completely. We were particularly disappointed by the absence of Radio Slovenia and the failure of TV SLO to report on the event, although the team filmed the whole press conference. <p/> Friday, 01 September 2000 <p/> In May, the President of the Family Initiative was a guest on the TV SLO programme Odmevi on the subject of the draft law on parental care and family benefits. He was also able to speak about the situation of Slovenian families on Odmevi in August. <p/> Friday, 30 June 2000 <p/> After the election of the Bajukov Government, we immediately established contacts with the new State Secretary for Family, Aleksandra Forte, who showed great interest in our proposals and submitted them to the Government. Unfortunately, the then Minister of Finance in the government prevented the adoption of the bill and the government amendments prepared by the MoFSA, causing a delay of several weeks in the consideration of the bill in the DZ. It is perhaps because of this delay that the second reading in the DZ remained only halfway through. <p/> Sunday, 30 April 2000 <p/> In April, in the material for the consideration of this Bill, the Government also presented the results of the recording of the prices of childcare products, which showed that the Family Initiative's prediction that the increased taxation of these products would be fully reflected in their increased cost and would be borne entirely by the parents was absolutely correct. For more on this, see the 1996-2000 Family Policy Review. <p/> Tuesday 13 July 1999 <p/> We have intervened in the first reading of the Parenthood and Family Benefits Bill with concrete proposals for improvements to the Bill. The document containing our proposals was included in the official material on the Bill and the DZ recommended that the Government take some of our proposals into account when preparing the Bill for its second reading.",List of Summaries/Excerpts,train
347,"Multimodal transport is the transport of goods all the way to the place where the goods will be handed over by the multimodal transport contractor. Here, two modern means of transport from two different transport industries are used simultaneously. Here, the first means of transport together with the cargo becomes the cargo for the second means of transport from the other transport sector, on the basis of one multimodal transport contract and one document, irrespective of the type and number of means of transport used. Therefore, in multimodal transport, the role of the customer of the multimodal transport is important. This branch of transport is complex, and a good multimodal transport contractor is therefore well placed to organise and execute multimodal transport at all levels. The multimodal transport contractor has an interest in performing contractual and non-contractual obligations as a good contractor, since it is liable from the moment of receipt of the goods until the moment of handover. It is also liable for the conduct of its servants and of other persons hired by it for the performance of the multimodal transport contract. It is therefore very important that the multimodal transport contractor adequately insures its liability, as it has no influence on the various risks it faces. The aim of this thesis is to explore in more detail multimodal transport, the multimodal transport contractor and its liability in multimodal transport.",Information/Explanation,train
348,"THE STRAGON STORY <p/> The image of Strygon is impressive, supernatural with traits of the divine, as if he were not of this world. Yet he is not beautiful, he is merely strange and frightening. His body is not entirely human, but bears distinct traits of anthropomorphism. He is a goat with human limbs and an upright posture. It has a goat's face with horns and a prominent hump that ends in a short, protruding tail. Some people still believe that whoever manages to touch its tail will be safe from all the scourges of life. His legs are of unequal length with large feet, which made it difficult for him to walk, and he limped and wheezed so that he could be heard from afar when he came. Because of his outward appearance, he was thought to be the devil, a demon that drinks blood. It was said that at night he would creep up on beautiful married women and sleep with them. Probably because he walked around half naked and liked to show off his possessions. Yes, they were even afraid of him because of his appearance and made up all sorts of stories about his evil deeds. But nothing was true... well, maybe if you took offence and didn't offer him good wine something could happen to you, but nothing fatal, you could get up in the morning feeling sick or with a headache. If you were so spellbound by Strygon you were treated with coals, a cup of water and prayers, and when you met him again it helped to 'hold your horns' in your pocket and spit gently sideways or roll up your trousers and turn at least one piece of underwear the wrong way round. Otherwise, he loved to help and use his magical skills to heal both humans and animals. And those whom he so helped liked to reward him with good wine, and he asked for nothing else. It seemed as if Strygon could not find his peace, and he roamed the villages of Istria, staging shrigonerias and looking for good wine. He helped some, he taught others, and he left a pleasant or unpleasant memory everywhere, depending, of course, on how he was received. Today, Strygon no longer walks around, and Istranians wonder where he ended up. Some miss him because he helped them, others are happy because they no longer have to fear him. But Štrigon has simply found his place in the sun in a wine bar in the middle of Portorož, where he can enjoy the company of good and cheerful people all the time, and above all, never run out of wine, as he did during his wanderings on the Šavrin hills. His eyes became sparkling, his heart full of goodness and his goblet full of the noble liquid. <p/> P.S.

She began by stressing that Ljubljana needs new leadership, freshness, economy and responsibility. At the press conference, her candidacy was endorsed by representatives of New Slovenia and the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS): Anton Kranjc, representative of the NSi City Committee, Dragutin Mate, President of the SDS City Committee, Dr Žiga Turk, Minister of Education, Culture and Sport, Aleš Hojs, Minister of Defence, and the Director of the Government Communications Office, Mag. Anže Logar. <p/> As she said in her opening remarks, from the very beginning of the identification process, she has been working to bring the Spring Spring Day parties together to agree on a joint candidacy. Both the initiative and the support then came from the ranks of the Slovenian Democratic Party. The candidacy is first and foremost the result of her personal decision. The candidacy is a particular challenge for her - she is familiar with the mayoralty, having followed it closely as a city councillor, and as such is well acquainted with Ljubljana's burning issues. After all, she is also a resident of old Ljubljana, which has become a beautiful city centre in recent years, but looks are not everything. Behind it are many problems that citizens face on a daily basis. . <p/> There are still a number of deliberately inflicted injuries to the Ljubljana organism that will have to be treated, which have been covered up in the past with many ""beauty operations"". Since we do not want to look for a receiver for Ljubljana in the next regular mayoral elections, we need to elect a good steward in this one - one who will spend money for the benefit of all Ljubljana citizens, who will conscientiously manage the city's land, who will carefully protect the reputation of public companies, who will carry out tenders transparently, who will select contractors responsibly and who will make sure that every subcontractor is paid fairly. The New Slovenia and the Slovenian Democratic Party are behind all of the above, as they have already demonstrated by their performance in the City Council. <p/> Mojca Kucler Dolinar concluded her announcement of her candidacy for Mayor of Ljubljana with her desire to show an alternative to what has happened in Ljubljana so far that is good, effective and puts the people of the capital at the centre. <p/> Dragutin Mate, President of the SDS City Committee, endorsed Dolinar as an excellent candidate who knows Ljubljana very well and has a lot of experience, which is a guarantee that she will be a good steward of Ljubljana and that she will introduce the necessary changes to improve the lives of the citizens of Ljubljana. He stressed the cooperation of both parties in the preparation of the programme. <p/> Anton Kranjc, representative of the NSi City Committee, stressed that Kucler Dolinar is the best choice at this moment because she has experience, she knows how to lead, she knows how to communicate. She knows exactly what is right and what is wrong, and she stands for honesty and sincerity. <p/> City Councillor Anže Logar (SDS) pointed out that Kucler Dolinar has always been an active City Councillor - including as Vice-Chair of the Commission on Mandate Issues, Elections and Appointments, which she now chairs, she supports a lively debate from the point of view of morality and ethics for the benefit of Ljubljana, and would like to see this kind of debate in the City Council as well. In his words, the candidate stands for the power of argument, not for the argument of power. <p/> Minister of Defence Aleš Hojs (NSi) is pleased to see the joint support of the NSi and the SDS. He sees in the candidate the possibility of change for the better and the realisation of the fundamental programme of New Slovenia: ""The word is valid. <p/> Minister Dr Žiga Turk (SDS) stressed that Ljubljana deserves a good mayor who is honest, capable and enthusiastic like Kucler Dolinar.

364,"Lukšič does not expect Janša and Janković to take ""radical measures"" <p/> Ljubljana, 08 January (STA) - SD President Igor Lukšič believes that the findings of the anti-corruption commission regarding their assets should make Prime Minister and SDS President Janez Janša and PS President Zoran Janković think twice and then do ""what the majority expects"".Lukšič also believes that the SD President and SDS President Janez Janša and the PS President Zoran Janković should rethink the matter. But he said it was difficult to expect them to decide on ""any radical measures"". <p/> It is very bad for Slovenia that we have two people at the top of Slovenian politics who ignore the practice we want to introduce in the country, i.e. that politicians have transparent finances, that they are able to explain where their income comes from, and if they are not able to do so, that they leave their posts, Lukšič said in response to the findings of the anti-corruption commission. <p/> He hopes that ""this is the drop over the edge that will finally mean the introduction of a new practice in Slovenian politics"". Asked specifically whether Janša and Janković should resign, he said that the right thing to do would be ""to think the matter through and then do what the majority expects"". <p/> However, he does not want to talk about the options that would follow a possible resignation - whether he himself would opt for a technical government or for early elections. First, he says, they both have to make the right move, and only then will there be time to think about the way forward. <p/> He adds that ""there is no point in getting ahead of ourselves, because unfortunately experience shows that in such situations, people in Slovenia have so far, as a rule, not decided to do what they should have done"". <p/> What is important for Slovenia, he says, is to get a government that is credible. Lukšič points out that the government has 18% support and that this is a key problem. He also problematises the fact that a government with 18% support is going to sell Slovenian assets. ""We simply know that this will not be done credibly, it cannot be,"" he concludes. <p/> "" If these deals are run by people who cannot explain how 200 000 came into their account, how will they be able to explain where these huge billions will go. 12 billion are at stake,"" the SD leader added. <p/> The Anti-Corruption Commission found that SDS President Janez Janša and Positivna Slovenije President Zoran Janković had violated anti-corruption legislation when auditing the assets of party presidents. According to the Commission, Janković failed to declare assets worth at least €2.4 million, and part of the financial inflows into his personal bank account came from a chain of transactions that started in Grep. As for Janša, he notes that his assets have inexplicably increased by €210,000.",News/Reporting,train

371,"The entire ""pulmo team"" of the Clinical Department of Pulmonary Diseases and Allergies of the Internal Medicine Clinic and the management of the University Medical Centre Ljubljana were delighted by the donation made by Bankart, payment instrument processing, d.o.o., Ljubljana. <p/> With the help of Bankart's donation, an important part of the bronchoscopy equipment (processor, light source, monitor, camera adapter) was renovated at the Pulmonary Diseases and Allergies Unit. The equipment is more modern, more powerful and more compatible with other devices, so that bronchoscopies can be performed at the highest professional level. Bronchoscopy (an invasive method for examining and removing tissue from the lower respiratory tract and lungs) is one of the most important tests used in the diagnosis of various diseases (lung cancer, sarcoidosis, other diseases of the lung tissue, etc.). The Clinical Department of Pulmonary Diseases and Allergies performs around 700 such tests a year. The equipment needed for these tests wears out over the years and also becomes obsolete, which is why Bankart's donation is extremely important. The state-of-the-art equipment will also allow them to carry out pleuroscopies - an examination of the ribs. <p/> The representative of Bankart, d.o.o., Mrs Maja Usnik, Director of the Financial and Accounting General Sector, expressed her satisfaction at the handover of the donation that the equipment will make a significant contribution to the quality of bronchoscopy. She concluded by expressing her wish to continue to meet in this way in the future. <p/> The donation was first acknowledged by the professional director, Prof. Dr. Saša Markovič, MD, PhD, Senior Counsellor, who congratulated the staff on obtaining the title of Clinical Department or Tertiary Status of the Department. <p/> The employees of the Clinical Department of Pulmonary Diseases and Allergies are proud of the new title of their unit, which was awarded to them by the Ministry of Health at the end of 2008. When the Golnik Clinical Department of Pulmonary Diseases and Allergies moved from UKC Ljubljana ten years ago, the Centre for the Treatment of Patients with Pulmonary Diseases was established in UKC Ljubljana, initially primarily to meet the needs of UKC Ljubljana. Initially, only three doctors were employed to provide a consultancy service for UKC Ljubljana, treating patients in 15 beds. With a great deal of enthusiasm and self-denial, together with the nursing and non-medical staff, they have achieved significant development over 10 years. In addition to hospital activities, they have started a specialist outpatient clinic, which sees 8,000 patients a year. Invasive diagnosis of lung diseases has been redefined. Research activities have been developed. They have published a large number of articles in the foreign and national literature. They lecture at national and international professional meetings. They have made a significant contribution to the educational activities of the Faculty of Medicine. The most important areas of their work are: diagnosis of patients with lung cancer, patients with diseases of the ribs, patients with sarcoidosis and patients with pulmonary hypertension. Last but not least, they are the main Slovenian centre for the management of patients before and after lung transplantation. Of course, they also treat patients with all other lung diseases from the Ljubljana region, of which there are not a few. <p/> At the closing ceremony, Erna Kos Grabnar, Chief Nurse of UKC Ljubljana, emphasised that the staff would certainly not have been so successful if they had not worked so well together, as they are considered a friendly and highly qualified team, where the cooperation between doctors, nursing staff and others is at an enviable level.",Other,train

373,"It's like the Slovenian government without Dimitri Rupel, hehe. 1 I am writing this after watching yesterday's Trends. I stopped watching the show some time ago (mainly because of the lack of culture and unprofessional guests), but after a huge outpouring of black bile, I decided to watch it anyway to see where all the anger came from. Let me add my little finger to the debate for the time being. <p/> The point revolved around Michael Jarc, who wants to call a local referendum on the building of a mosque. I don't know the exact question (and, coyotes of journalism, they haven't published it anywhere - more proof of how much they care about the truth as long as it pops! ), but it seems to me that he doesn't want to completely block the building of a mosque, maybe just some minarets and/or accompanying sports facilities. This question has already been answered by the Constitutional Court, which ruled on a similar issue in 2004. At that time it stated: <p/> 35. From the foregoing it can be concluded that the objective pursued by the contested regulation is to restrict the right under Article 41(1) of the Constitution. However, such an objective is inadmissible in the light of Article 15(3) of the Constitution, according to which human rights may be restricted only for the sake of the rights of others (and in the cases provided for by this Constitution), because it is only for the purpose of restricting a right and not for the simultaneous protection of the rights of others. <p/> Therefore, paragraph 2 of the Decision calling the referendum is incompatible with the right to the free exercise of religion. Thus, the interference proves to be constitutionally impermissible already on the basis of an assessment under the so-called legitimacy test, and therefore the Constitutional Court did not need to engage in a further assessment of its excessiveness. <p/> So nothing will happen with the envisaged referendum. Although this did not stop Jelincic from (as always) starting a dispute 2 - although he then coldly told Becirovic to his face that he was a fool for equating him with Haider. The ever-noble Member is certainly as cunning as a pretzel, although the wiser ones are quick to overlook him. Once you have acquired some legal knowledge, he comes off as pathetic when he is clinging to the Slovenian Constitution and when he wants to lecture Mire Senica while the latter looks thoughtfully into the distance through the camera, inventing synonyms for his interlocutor in his head, without batting an eyelid. <p/> It seems to be popular lately for lawyers to engage pro bono only for cases that have the potential to be highly publicised in the media (Čeferin in Strojanovi PRESS) - lawyers are not allowed to (only) advertise. Andrej Saje also provided a newsflash bomb by saying that he wished the Islamic community all the best in the construction of their building, as he wanted everyone to have equal opportunities in terms of religion. OK, I guess we're not in the 14th century anymore and the Church has managed to civilise itself a bit and they're no longer impaling heretics on stakes or handing them over to the secular authorities to be cremated. But at least a little bit of rancour wouldn't hurt, no. At least a crude observation about the wrong God, pretty please? Well, it's not as if everyone is saying that the other side belongs to the wrong God and so, after taking all the creeds into account, we'll all be burned in Hell together. Or what? <p>Let us return to the mosque. As far as the morons have been and fallen out, everyone has one iota of a point. So, to combine them all into one (of) sentence. We definitely need a mosque. There is a good percentage of Muslims in Slovenia, and I do not see how it can benefit all of them to deny them a place to gather and a chance to practice their religion. We should not turn a blind eye - there are around 50 local places of worship in Slovenia, and the Orthodox faith also has its own church. The second issue is architectural. Very interestingly, Jelincic has pulled out a regulation from the naphthalene, which says that the building must be A metres away from the railway tracks 3. It must be appropriate to the surroundings or respect the architectural guidelines of the surroundings 4 As I am informed, the minaret is not compulsory, nor is the circular shape of the central building. I was also a bit disturbed by the picture showing a supposed mosque (although no tender/competition has yet been carried out), around which there is a hefty pile of sports and other facilities. It is true that they themselves know best what they need to carry out the precepts of their religion, and that even the Catholic Church has a house next door where ... er, well, yes ... religion takes place. However, the suggestion of tennis courts, a gym and a football pitch seems to me to be a bit of a stretch. After all, they (read the Arab Emirates) will be paying for everything themselves, so let them afford it if they can. <p/>After watching this, I'm not any more convinced that I'll start watching the Dren Dren Dren Dren Dren again, because they're on an even lower level than before. Uroš Slak really gives the impression that he only invites such guests autonomously for the sake of shouting, because when it flares up, he can't seem to extinguish it or turn the flow of the shouting conversation around. Apparently, they really cannot agree on anything or come to common conclusions, all that matters is the show, the shit and the stupidity. Anyway, I am in favour of the mosque (not exactly there and then and there, as they imagine in Trends, but let's wait for the actual tender) and I think that once it is built, there will finally be peace around this subject, which is being blown up to the proportions of a galaxy quite unnecessarily. So far, I have not seen anyone stoning a cuckolded man in an Orthodox church, or anyone burning down the home of a neighbour because he invites his friends to pray there. <p/> Or would you rather have a semi-stealing series called Brother to Brother, which costs EUR 1.5 million, and therefore we get True Reality cancelled because they cannot scratch together EUR 50 000? Although, somehow, it seems to me that this is more of an excuse to turn the national broadcaster into a brainwashing car wash, in the same way that it is now popular to lay off workers during a 'global crisis'. <p/> Anyway, every now and then I laugh at / marvel at the bizarreness of our professionals when they want to get into computing or the Internet - in today's case, it will be the legal profession. Sandra Cico, a lawyer, as a representative of the Association for the Protection of Audio-Visual Works, has sent the two sheets below to some (where is T-2, for example? ? ? ? ) Slovenian Internet access providers, demanding that they be blocked from accessing the torrent tracker PirateBay.org. It gives them 24 hours, then threatens them with legal and criminal proceedings. <p/> I understand the legal profession and the wishes of their clients, especially if one of them is about to receive a pile of money. However, this 'letter' is both legally and technically misguided. OK, they get the plaudits because they obviously know what an IP range is and what a tracker is, but for everything else I do not know whether to blame the ignorance of the law firm or the nepotism of Association 1. I would never dare to send such a request myself, even if local factors were very strong and very persistent. <p/> Banning the Internet, or parts of it, is ridiculous, impossible and slightly totalitarian. We all remember when udba.net hit - we streamed masses of scanned lists, searched there for our enemies and a few days later we were surprised by a fucking ""blackout"". Of course, the real geeks found themselves, and we grabbed some politically incorrect proxy and went back to the hilarious history of Danilo Potnik, Win Parachute and Ivan Janša. So the demand to ban a particular site is very ineffective, but it is also undemocratic - if memory serves, I pay for uninterrupted access to the entire web, if anyone has done anything illegal there, let them get on with it, leave the other users alone. <p/> The legal aspect can be problematic, especially because (as we are used to) the subject is not regulated with sufficient precision, let alone extensive case law. The requirement is interesting in its own way because it obliges Internet access providers to ban a site as if they had something to do with it (in Sweden, hello? ! ). The old Slovenian Penal Code knew a nice institution, cascading liability. It was really only for responsible editors, printers, etc., but we could follow that model. Of course, if the KZ-1 had not completely abolished cascading liability. Why? Well, the Minister's answer is as ""convincing"" as abolishing relative limitation periods. <p/> Liability on the Internet would go something like this: first, of course, the author, whose identification can become a whole project on the Internet, as there are plenty of tools for anonymisation. Second in line would be the webmaster. I'm not really talking about a webmaster per se, I'm thinking more of SiOL with its nest of blogs that anyone can open. If we couldn't get to that point, or if he was hiding in the Philippines, the domain owner would come into play, in very extreme cases of course. That is kind of where it all ends for my taste. It certainly ends with the Internet access providers, because, firstly, there is simply too much traffic for anyone to be able to monitor all their subscribers, and secondly, this requirement is absurd, because then, for example, all the providers in the world are responsible for the illegal streaming of copyright content via PirateBay, whose subscribers are, in a communist way, sharing games, music, programmes, porn amongst themselves. It is like the passengers on the trains in Madrid in 2004 suing the train company because a bomb was planted there by terrorists. The providers are just offering Internet access and there is no logic in having anything to do with something that someone creates and puts on a server at the other end of the Earth. <p/> Finally, a reflection for all the budding Slovenian pirates - THEIR responsibility in downloading illegal content from various trackers. Too many of them are brave, because so far there have been no serious / mass / high-profile police actions in Slovenia targeting anyone other than the traffickers, so they go around the forums shouting and beating their chests that nobody can do anything to them, while at the same time citing some EU directives and regulations. Let me disappoint you, oh, dear fellow-travellers. The Criminal Code (even the new one, strange that they have not abolished these things yet) knows about the infringement of copyright and other rights, which Sandra Cico already refers to - Articles 148 and 149 of the CC-1 are recommended reading. Add to that Article 38 - aiding and abetting (in the commission of a crime) and you have the perpetrator, streaming illegal content from the web. This applies to all ""ordinary"" pirates as well as to trackers (Filebits, Partis, Slobytes, etc.). This is really only a theoretical construct, and I cannot imagine Slovenian police officers and prosecutors looking at the troves of data on seized computers or 12 geeks sitting in court. After all, maybe we can look forward to live blogging, heh. <p/> As for these societies, it seems to me that we have quite a lot of them in Slovenia, although most of the time we don't hear anything intelligent from them, but it's more like air stirring. [ ] <p/> It is the title of a textbook on the Turkish invasions of Slovenian territory by Vasko Simoniti. And every time a multi-tourism kinastera comes to my mind, I start thinking about a topic related to culture. Today, I am going to get stuck into our beloved Slovenian language and spelling, or rather, into their squinting. <p/> Let's start with food. Hello. Olive oil. I have never heard a more butthurt word. Just as the oil itself became very fancy - almost art - when Jamie Oliver unhygienically poured it over arugula and parmesan. And it has also suddenly become artful to call it OIL. Let's go slowly: we know the tree that borders on the shrub, Olea europaea, that is, OLIVE. So, by induction, we find that the logical name for it is OLIVE fucking OIL. Mainly because it is the delicious olive that goes into the press, not just the tree - the olive. True, the SSKJ allows both terms, but olive is completely redundant. Especially since some SSKJ authors suggest the word crack for bun. Mhm. <p/>The other part, where there are untold problems, is the overlapping or, in the vernacular, umlauts. There are usually no peculiarities in the writing, except that the Council on Kanal A will apparently have to quickly upgrade the encoding to UTF-8 or change the font, because surnames with ü's are written as ue, although it is true that Slavoj Žižek is always left without a cross (above his head) abroad. It's the pronunciation that gets complicated. <p/> At the end of last year, we got a third President of the Republic, Danilo Türk, who won by a large margin. But even today there are some people (most of them in 24 hours on POP TV) who find it difficult to pucker their lips for the letter u and pronounce the letter i. All too often, however, they hear the disparaging Tirk; the unforgiving call him Turk (Zmago Padalec PRESS). Hans-Gert Pöttering, the current President of the European Parliament, is suffering a similar fate. He is most often rechristened Pottering or Petering. But it is the same, who would even bother! <p/> After a hard lesson, it is always good to relax / have fun, so take a look at how the new President Türk is perceived by the legends Ivan and Miro Serpentinšek, sorry, Serppentinschäck.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

382,"Coats of arms in the Chapel of St George at Ljubljana Castle <p/> 17.09.10 Author: Aleksander Hribovšek <p/> The Chapel of St George at Ljubljana Castle is the only major architectural monument in Slovenia that is decorated with coats of arms and commemorates the former regency. Its present appearance shows the most important architectural elements of its Gothic base and Baroque superstructure. The history of the construction reveals two layers of time. The first dates back to 1489, when Emperor Frederick III established a benefice at the castle in honour of St George, St Pancras and St Helena, and the second to the additions made after 1616. The exact year of the beginning of the construction is not known, but it was certainly built before the foundation of the benefice. <p/> The castle chapel is mainly decorated with the coats of arms of the governors of Carniola who served in Ljubljana from 1261 to 1742. They were painted by Abraham Kaltschmied, a copper-engraver, draughtsman and engineering lieutenant at the time, when Count Corbinian of Saurauški was the head of the provincial Estates. The regional governors were the chiefs of the land, alongside the Emperor, the supreme ruler. They were at the head of the Land Estates and the Land Administration. They were appointed by the rulers on the proposal of the provincial Estates. The governor administered the land and was the supreme judge, taking orders from the ruler and presiding over the provincial assemblies. Initially, he was the king's deputy, but during the interregnum he was deputy to the various rulers who briefly held the land. The Habsburgs retained the office of governor, who became deputy to the Prince of the Land and commander of the Land's army, as well as president of the Land's Diet. <p/> The coats of arms in the chapel can be divided into three groups: on the north, west and south walls are painted the coats of arms of the sixty Land Governors of Carniola, followed by the coats of arms of the five Austrian rulers on the chancel ceiling, and the coats of arms of the Duchy of Carniola, the Border County of Istria and the Duchy of Slovene Landscape on the ceiling to round off the whole composition; the coats of arms of the Duchy of Carniola, the Border County of Istria and the Duchy of Slovene Landscapes are on the chapel ceiling. The chapel was first decorated with them between 1742 and 1747. The first year, 1742, is on the painting plan held by the Archives of the Republic of Slovenia (ARS), while the year 1747 is painted in the chapel itself, next to an inscription stating that the coats of arms were to be restored in that year, but this may be an error and the coats of arms may have been painted for the first time at that time. The chapel was probably also restored in 1849, when the west wall and its armorial decoration were demolished. In 1915 the chapel was rebuilt again, this time after the earthquake. In the late 1980s, a final and thorough restoration began, which was completed in the early 1990s, including the west wall, and the coats of arms were to be restored to their original appearance. At least roughly. <p/> Miha Preinfalk from the Scientific Research Centre of the SAZU and Prof. Barbara Žabota, Professor of History and Sociology, examined the fate of the coats of arms in St George's Chapel at the beginning of the new millennium (see bottom of the page), from the time of their creation to the present day, and pointed out the many discrepancies and mistakes that occurred during the renovations. They also give five lists of the coats of arms depicted and compare them. We will concentrate on the first two only. The first list gives the probable state of the original painting and is based on the 1742 painting plan. The basis for its creation (not only the content, form and order of the inscriptions, but also the coats of arms themselves and their heraldic style) is the list of regional governors in Valvasor's Slav of the Duchy of Carniola (the first fifty-six governors). Whether Valvasor's list is historically accurate or not is of secondary importance for our presentation of the coats of arms. The second list shows the present state after the last renovation, as visitors can see it on the walls of the chapel. <p/>There are considerable differences between the lists themselves in terms of variations in the form of the inscriptions (e.g. MAJNHARD or MAYHART), minor sloppiness (e.g. SEVFNIG instead of SEVENIG) or errors (e.g. BERG. instead of BEGR. "" begraben "" or buried), which probably occurred during the restorations. Also, the 12 coats of arms have incorrect years. Errors are also found among the regnal coats of arms. Thus, the correct date of death of Archduke Charles is in fact 10 July 1590, and not as indicated in the first and second lists, which are compared below. Duchess Mary (wife of the aforementioned Archduke Charles) was not the daughter of Duke Albert IV of Bohemia, as shown in the current situation or in the second list, but in fact the daughter of Duke Albert V of Bavaria (BOEHMEN instead of BAYERN), as the coat-of-arms image itself testifies. <p/> In the photographs below we can compare the two lists. The captions on the photographs show the current state of the frescoes on the walls of St George's Chapel, while the captions below the photographs show the first list, or the list based on the 1742 plan for the frescoes. <p/> Discrepancies and errors also occurred during the painting or restoration of the coats of arms. In most cases, where there has been a discrepancy, it is simply a case of using the wrong colour of a field or attribute, or sometimes of using the wrong pictorial template altogether.",Information/Explanation,train

390,"An applicant for a review of a public tender does not, under the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures, per se acquire the status of a party to an administrative dispute in which the administrative decision awarding the concession is challenged, which concludes a tendering procedure in which he did not participate. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The appeal is dismissed and the decision of the Administrative Court of the Republic of Slovenia in Ljubljana, No U 2088/2001-9 of 30 January 2002 is confirmed. <p/> Reasoning <p/> By the contested order, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action against the defendant's decision of 22.11.2001 under point 1 of the operative part of the order and dismissed the application for interim measures of 23.11.2001 under point 2 of the operative part of the order.By that decision granting a concession for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services, it was decided to grant the concession to M. d.d. for a period of 15 years, with the possibility of renewal, V., L. It was also decided that the concession shall include the right to use the frequency bands, to install the relevant public telecommunications network, to interconnect the network and that the concessionaire shall be obliged to ensure the operation of its network in accordance with the Regulation on the granting of concessions, with other regulations and with the concession contract, to pay a one-off non-refundable concession fee of 22 billion Slovenian tolls and to pay an annual fee for the use of the allocated part of the radio spectrum. The defendant published a public tender for the award of up to three concessions for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia in the frequency bands 1900 MHz-1980 MHz, 2010 MHz-2025 MHz and 2110 MHz-2170 MHz in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 19/01 of 16.3.2001. The first call for tenders was unsuccessful because only one tender was received, and a new call for tenders for the award of the concession was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 46/01 of 8.6.2001. At the time of the opening of the tenders, the expert committee noted that five potential tenderers had submitted tender documents on the basis of the call for tenders, and that two tenders had been received within the time limit for submission of the tenders within the time limit for submission of tenders. One bid did not contain all the elements required in the tender documents and was therefore not considered. On 3.9.2001, the applicant submitted a request for review of the concession award procedure to the National Audit Office. By decision of 8.11.2001, the latter rejected the request for review. The concession award procedure, which had been suspended as a result of the submitted review, was continued. The expert committee, which drew up its report of 19.11.2001, found that the tender submitted by M.d.d. met the conditions of the tender documents. In the grounds of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance stated in paragraph 1 of the operative part of the judgment that it had taken its decision to reject the application on the basis of the preliminary examination of the application under Article 34(1)(4) of the Administrative Disputes Act (CLA). A claimant in an administrative dispute can only be a person who has the status of an active party in the administrative proceedings, a person who has the status of a passive party and a person who has participated in the administrative proceedings as an intervener in order to protect his rights or legal interests. In the procedure for the award of the concession, in addition to the successful concessionaire, parties to the procedure may be those tenderers whose bids were not accepted. The tenders for the concession were submitted by M.d.d. and D.d.o.o. within the tendering period, but the applicant did not participate in the tender. In an administrative dispute challenging a decision taken in an administrative procedure in which the applicant was neither a party nor an intervener, the applicant does not have standing, since the contested decision clearly did not infringe its rights or direct interests based on the law. The applicant has not established the right or the legal interest to assert the claim alleged in the application and its active standing, which is a procedural prerequisite for bringing an administrative action, is not established. The applicant's request for a review of the procedure for the award of the concession for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services was rejected by decision of the State Audit Commission of 8.11.2001. Article 23(2) of the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 78/99 and No 90/99) provides that there is no ordinary or extraordinary remedy against the decisions of the State Audit Board, but that an action may be brought before a competent court to seek damages from the contracting authority. Objections relating to the award procedure which have already been decided by the National Audit Office do not constitute legally relevant objections in the review procedure of the concession award decision. In the explanatory memorandum to 2. point 2 of the operative part of the judgment, the Court of First Instance stated that the applicant had not established that the decision challenged in the action infringed its rights or its direct interests based on the law, which is a procedural prerequisite for a decision on an application for an interim injunction under Article 69 of the Civil Procedure Code. This follows from the reasons set out in recital 1 of the operative part of the judgment, since the applicant has failed to establish its standing to bring the action. The Court of First Instance therefore dismissed the application for interim measures pursuant to Article 69(2) of the Civil Code. <p/> The applicant appeals on all three grounds set out in Article 72 of the Civil Procedure Code. The appellant claims that the Court of Appeal should set aside both points of the contested order and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a fresh decision. The applicant claims that it has standing to bring the action and the application for interim measures in the present proceedings. The Court of First Instance bases its position solely on the fact that the applicant did not submit a tender in response to the invitation to tender and thus did not participate directly as an active party or as a passive party or intervener. Such reasoning effectively limits the potential claimants in an administrative dispute exclusively to direct and formal parties to the procedure prior to the adoption of the administrative act, for which there is no legal basis in Article 18 of the CPL. The circle of potential claimants in an administrative dispute is much wider under that provision. Anyone who believes that an administrative act infringes a right or a direct benefit of his or her based on the law may be a claimant. The theory also recognises the active standing of a party who has not even formally participated in the administrative procedure, provided that he can, of course, establish or prove his legal interest. In a tendering procedure, the legal status of intervener within the meaning of Article 43 of the General Administrative Procedure Act cannot exist. It was only possible to participate in the tendering procedure as a tenderer or as an applicant for review under the Act on Review of Public Procurement Procedures. In the review procedure, the applicant was granted the status of a party and active standing. It is reasonable to assume that, taking into account the specificities of the tender procedure, the applicant was indeed a party to the tender procedure as an applicant for review and was granted such status by the defendant and the National Audit Office. It therefore considers that it had already demonstrated its legal interest in participating in the tendering procedure in the procedure preceding the defendant's decision by submitting a request for review, since it did not submit a tender on the ground that the tendering procedure was unlawful. It can therefore legitimately claim that the contested decision of the defendant, as an administrative act adopted in the context of a tendering procedure, infringes its rights and directly benefits. In fact, as a result of the illegality of the invitation to tender, the applicant lost the possibility of obtaining the concession which was the subject of the invitation to tender and which was finally awarded to M. by the contested administrative decision, as an act adopted in a procedure which the applicant claims to have been unlawful. It is untenable to hold that it has active standing to bring an application for review in the same proceedings in which, following the conclusion of those proceedings and the adoption of the administrative act, it does not have active standing to bring the action. Apart from the finding that the applicant did not submit its bid in the tendering procedure and the erroneous assertion that it did not assert or protect its rights in the concession award procedure, that is to say, in the tendering procedure, the Court of First Instance does not give any other substantive reasoning in the contested order. It did not serve the application and the application for interim measures on the defendant for a response. Nor did it hold the main hearing which had been requested in order to further substantiate the allegations by examining witnesses. It did not even state reasons for its decision, since it did not state the reasons on the decisive facts, which constitutes an absolute fundamental infringement of the procedural provisions within the meaning of Article 72(3) of the Civil Procedure Code. By failing to hold a main hearing, the Court of First Instance substantially infringed the procedural provisions within the meaning of Article 72(4) of the Civil Procedure Code. In addition, it erred and failed to fully establish the factual situation as regards the applicant's legal status and activities in the tendering procedure itself and its rights and direct benefits, and, as a consequence, it erred in substantive law in holding that the applicant did not have active legal standing to bring the action in the present proceedings. The applicant also has standing to bring an application for interim measures and, in accordance with the provisions of the CPL, fully maintains its application for interim measures in the present case. <p/> In its response to the appeal, the defendant submits that the applicant cannot be a party to these proceedings as it lacks standing. The applicant did not submit a bid for the concession either in the first or in the re-tender. The fact that the applicant has already provided mobile telecommunications services does not automatically confer a legal interest in bringing the present action. Since it did not participate in the concession award procedure by submitting any tender, the concession award decision did not decide on its rights. The administrative measure therefore does not affect her rights or a legitimate interest. The possibility of exercising the right to obtain the concession ended with the expiry of the time-limit for submitting a complete tender for the invitation to tender. The fact that the applicant has been granted a legal interest in the review procedure before the National Audit Office does not automatically confer a legal interest in the administrative proceedings. In the proceedings before the National Audit Commission, the status of a party is determined by Article 9 of the Law on the review of public procurement procedures, whereas in the proceedings before the Administrative Court, it is determined by Article 18 of the CPL. Each law defines the active legal capacity of the parties in a different way. The Law on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures provides for a wider range of beneficiaries who may initiate a review procedure on the ground that an independent body is reviewing the legality of the public tender itself. Given that the party has been granted the status of party to the proceedings there, the competent authority has already assessed the legality of the call for tenders and rejected the request for review. The defendant submits, first of all, that the whole tendering procedure is unlawful and that it was therefore not possible for it to participate in the procedure. In the proceedings before the Administrative Court, however, the circle of persons with standing is narrower. It is for the competent court to determine whether the appellant's request to intervene is justified. Such a procedure prevents the chicanery of intervention by those who cannot show any prejudice and who would only make the proceedings more difficult for an active or passive party. The appellant therefore requests the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal as unfounded. <p/> The appeal is not well founded. <p/> In the Court of Appeal's view, the Court of First Instance was correct to dismiss the applicant's action on the basis of paragraph 34(1)(4) of Article 34(1) of the EC Treaty. <p/> of Article 34 of the CPL. The applicant's plea that it has active standing to bring an action in an administrative dispute is unfounded, since it relies on its indirect participation in the tendering procedure by virtue of the fact that it was the applicant in an application for review of a procurement procedure to which it was granted the status of a party. According to Article 18(1) of the CPL, a claimant may be an individual, a legal person, an organisation, a locality, a group of persons and others who consider that a right or a direct benefit of theirs based on a law has been infringed by an administrative act. However, according to the provision of Article 9 of the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures (Official Gazette of the RS, No 78/99), a request for review may be lodged by any person who has or had an interest in the award of a contract and who has suffered or may suffer damage as a result of the conduct of the contracting authority, which is alleged in the request for review as a misconduct of the contracting authority in the procedure for awarding the public contract. The Law on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures is a specific regulation governing the legal protection of tenderers in public procurement procedures, which is implemented by reviewing the public procurement procedures defined in the Public Procurement Law, the bodies competent for the protection of the rights of tenderers and the procedure governing the work of the bodies under this Law. However, there is no ordinary or extraordinary legal remedy against a decision of the State Audit Board, only an action before a competent court of law to seek damages from the contracting authority. Given the purpose and object of this law, the active standing in a review procedure is substantively different from that in an administrative dispute. Any person who has or had an interest in the award of a contract and any person who has suffered or may suffer damage as a result of the conduct of the contracting authority may bring an action for review. For this reason, a party to a review of public procurement procedures does not per se acquire the status of a party to administrative litigation proceedings when the decision to award a concession is challenged. The decision to award a concession puts an end to the tendering procedure, and an action against such a decision may only be brought by persons fulfilling the conditions laid down in Article 18(1) of the CPL. In the present case, the request for review of the concession award procedure was examined by the National Audit Commission and the specific request of the defendant was rejected. The subject-matter of the administrative dispute cannot therefore be a repetition of the identical claim, which is in fact the applicant's claim. In an administrative procedure, the applicant could only assert a right or a direct benefit based on a right which would be infringed by the decision to grant the concession. The grant of the concession is not a right of the defendant. The defendant's only right in a tendering procedure for the award of a concession is to submit its tender to the contracting authority within the time-limit, on the same terms as the other participants. Neither the Telecommunications Act nor the Regulation on the granting of concessions for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services gives rise to a direct benefit to the applicant based on the Act. It is apparent from the appellant's submissions that the defendant is only claiming an interest in fact in obtaining the concession, and is not demonstrating a legal interest by challenging the concession decision. In the present case, since there is neither a right nor a direct interest of the defendant based on the law which is infringed by the contested administrative measure, the Court of Appeal considers that the Court of First Instance was correct in its decision that the applicant had not established its active standing in the present administrative proceedings. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the action at the preliminary examination stage on the basis of Article 34(1)(4) of the CPL. At that stage of the proceedings, the Court of First Instance ruled exclusively on the applicant's standing, and therefore did not infringe the provision on the main hearing procedure (Article 72(4) of the Civil Procedure Code), since it did not rule on the substance or examine the substance of the contested measure. Nor did it serve copies of the application for interim measures and the application for interim measures with annexes on the defendant at that stage of the proceedings. It does so only after it has not dismissed the action under Article 34 of the Civil Procedure Code or annulled the contested measure under Article 35(1) of the Civil Procedure Code or declared it void under Article 35(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. The Court of First Instance also did not infringe the provision on the procedure in an administrative dispute (Article 72(3) of the CPL), since it based and explained its decision on the distinction between tendering, review and public procurement procedures and an administrative dispute (pages 3 and 4 of the judgment). <p/> The pleas in law alleging erroneous and incomplete findings of fact and incorrect application of the substantive law, however, relate only to the applicant's active standing. <The appellant's plea in law alleging that the application for interim measures was dismissed is also unfounded. The applicant does not have standing to bring an application for interim measures if it does not have standing to bring an action in administrative proceedings and, moreover, does not state on what grounds that that part of the order is unlawful. <p/> The Court of Appeal held that the grounds on which the applicant challenges the order of the Court of First Instance are not established. Nor are the grounds on which the Court of First Instance is required to act of its own motion. It therefore dismissed the appeal as unfounded on the basis of Article 73 in conjunction with Article 68 of the CLA and upheld the order of the Court of First Instance.",Legal/Regulation,train

Some women spin. <p/> No, I can't say that the somewhat pale light of the kerosene lamp made my childhood any sadder, on the contrary, it was quite joyful, full of curiosity, longing and duty.... <p/> In the dim glow of the kerosene lamp, the shadows in the corners and haylofts were full of fears, especially when our neighbour Ferdinand - the eternal young man - told us about the enchanted queens in the enchanted castle, about the dragon who had come for the castle's daughter, about the serpent in the spring, about the witches, the devil, the goblins, and about death. Fairy tales about the nuns and the judges must have been told to each other by the ancient Slavs. And Ferdinand had to tell us the happy one about the ""ass-gold"" several times. <p/> It was cold outside. Snow covered the hill and down the hill, and smoke from the chimneys of the dwarf wood-houses was drawn straight up into the sky, across which the mysterious moon passed from time to time. But it was warm behind the frosted shutters. A fire crackled in the stove or in the cooker. Somewhere in the distance, on another hill, dogs barked and howled at the pale moon... <p/> At that time, when I was young, nature was still clean. There was laughter and weeping, songs and quarrels, and then again visits, feasts, baptisms, funerals and carols. <p/> Today, all that is very different. After the first, a second war, four years of suffering and misery each time. Between the wars, life changes. The Partisans liberated our homeland, we erected memorials to our dead heroes. We began to live a new life, as our greatest hero, Tito, had envisioned in his early youth. <p/> Today, instead of a kerosene lamp in the middle of a pile of beans on the table, a light bulb from the ceiling glows. Electricity lights, heats, drives machines and cooks. Today, it is not Ferdinand telling the neighbour's fairy tales. We sit in front of the television and see and hear what is happening in our homeland and far beyond. We talk long distances and call acquaintances by pressing the electric bell... <p/> We could hardly have dreamt of all this in our youth. But nature was cleaner, wider and quieter. Perhaps at carnivals or at feasts, village musicians would swish. And on occasions, the song came straight from the throat, not from the radio or from gramophone records. It came from the heart, our beautiful Slovenian song. <p/> The past turned into memories. I can still see my mother looking after me when I go out into the world, to art, to Golden Prague. After many years, I have returned to my Slovenian hills, among you, to tell you some animal tales, sing a song, make a clay sculpture and paint a picture. You see, I can do it all! <p/> Written on the leg after New Year 1974",Opinion/Argumentation,train
401,"BEAR <p/> A little bear was wandering alone in the forest. The boys found him there and surrounded him: ""Eat, how nice his fur is and how chubby he is, I bet his mother feeds him honey! "" they shouted and laughed at him. But the boys decided to have him shaved naked at the barber's and sell his soft, long hair for ice cream. They shouted. "" <p/>Wanted-wanted, the teddy bear had to go with them - to the barber's. <p/> ""Shave it off for us, at any cost! "" they shouted at the foreman, who put the little beast on a stool, thinking it was a puppy. The furry friend defended himself, but when he saw himself in the mirror, he remembered his mother. For a moment, he even frowned, thinking that this was the way it had to be. The barber shook him off, but the boys kept him quiet. He was getting more and more naked. The hair was flying off him like a doughy phantom. But when the foreman clipped him around the navel, it tickled him so much that he slipped out one paw and swung it at the foreman's bald head. <p/>""Away, away with that bitch, what do you think, pay up, and don't come to me again with such jokes,"" shouted the master, ""I can't stand your foolishness! ""The children grabbed the teddy bear and ran away. They released it in the woods, tied to a boulder, and watched to see what would happen. <p/> The teddy bear took her to a stream and looked in the water to see what it was like. He was so ashamed that he took her deep into the forest. He stepped on a wasp's nest. The wasps went into it. He rolled around, humming and hawking at them. Then, all miserable, he fell asleep. <p/> The magpies and all the other birds gathered over him and shouted: <p/> ""Hey you, go on! ""<p/> And the teddy bear just became a bear with beautiful fur, the most beautiful in the whole neighbourhood. All the little bears fell in love with him, but he only married one. They had lovely little bears that are still alive today, if poachers hadn't taken them. <p/> ANIMALS <p/> In a hole in the walls of an ancient city by the sea lived an animal unlike any our little Gabrijelce had ever seen: it had four clawed paws, a head, a torso and a long thin tail. Its body was covered with light brown scales. <p/> Before the animal crawled into a black hole in the walls of the ancient city by the sea, it showed Gabrijelca its tongue. <p/> ""Mama, the animal showed me its tongue! "" said Gabrijelca, offended. <p/> Mom: <p/> ""Don't mind, it won't do you any harm, you see it has escaped into the black hole! "" <p/> ""Does the animal have a mother? "" asked Gabrijelca. <p/> ""Yes, this animal has a mom and a dad too! "" said Gabrijelca's mother. <p/> ""Where do the animal, its father and mother have an apartment? "" <p/> ""You know, because the animal was naughty and showed her tongue to her dad and mum, she had to leave home. Now she lives alone in a hole in this wall. Once she even crawled onto a big ship in the harbour and went around the world. All the time she was hiding from the bad sailors. When the ship finally returned to this ancient city by the sea, the animal made it ashore. Her parents disliked her even more from then on. And so the animal lives all alone in this hole in this ancient city by the sea! "" the mother finished. <p/> ""What about the animal papa? "" <p/> ""Since the animal has no teeth, it has to eat flies and worms,"" said the mother. <p/> ""Uh, I couldn't eat flies and worms! "" said the Little Goose. <p/> ""Yes, just be diligent, don't run away from home and don't show your tongue to anyone, don't sulk and don't get angry, and you'll be fine by me and your dad! It happens to naughty people that they have to go into a black hole. You see, for example, the fox, the badger, the mouse and the rat..."" <p/> ""That's right, Mum! I'll be diligent, not naughty like the badger and the fox! "" concluded the conversation of the Little Goose. <p/> GABRIELCA - the only child - wanted a brother. Since the maternity hospital no longer had any for her and she would have to stay on her own, she wanted at least an animal, be it a puppy, a kitten or a bird. Eventually she got to know all the dog breeds, but what she wanted most of all was a poodle - a curly-haired, ornamental city puppy, shaved to the lion's head, although she is afraid of anything that crawls and goes, and especially shakes when a larger dog appears and has to be picked up. <p/> Ata had to keep telling Gabrijelca that poodles, in particular, sucked in the house, they were a nuisance, as they were no guardians because they didn't dare to bite, and it was difficult with them if there wasn't a garden for them to run around and do their business by the fence, bush or tree. Such were Atos' contradictory teachings, but Gabrijelca only dreamt of a puppy. <p/>When she could already write, she wrote a letter to her teacher, Foltin, asking him to save one puppy - a little mix - for her to take on the bus home. She stuck the stamp on correctly, wrote the address and sent the letter. <p/> Teacher Foltin took her letter seriously. He brought the puppy - a baby - to the city himself, hoping that it would be well with Gabrijelca. <p/> Thus Gabrijelca's first wish came true: she became the proud owner of her beloved puppy. She named him Medo, because he was the most like a teddy bear. <p/> Of course, she had to show her teddy bear to all the children in the neighbourhood. They would all have loved to have a puppy like that, but this was hers. In time, she will teach him all sorts of arts and he will guard her faithfully in case a man with evil intentions ever comes, so she will make sure he is comfortable with her! <p/> Probably because Medo was from the country, he didn't know how to behave in the city in the first days and did the needful on the carpet. Mum patiently cleared the matter up. But as this happened several more times, she became unwilling. At night, Medo missed his mother's warmth and also craved her milk, so he cried and scratched at the door, so that his mother had to put him under the blankets, where he fell asleep, lying on his back like his father. <p/> But when all three of us had to leave the house in the morning, Medo whimpered sadly all morning and called for Gabrijelco. It would be like this all day long, so her mother started telling her that it couldn't go on like this, that the flat would start to smell, that the door would get more and more scratched and what else! She persisted for a few more days, but finally she ordered her to write to the teacher Foltin to come and get a puppy, because they couldn't have one. <p/> And Teacher Foltin wondered very much what the lovely animal had done to offend him so. And he really put Medek back in the car and drove him away. <p/> Gabrijelca silently endured her first sorrow. She realised that she could not have a puppy. To remember him, she pasted a colour photograph of herself with Medek in her arms into an album. <p/> ANIMAL <p/> Gabrijelca saw a tiny animal on top of a thistle. It was red with tiny spots all over its back and its head was all black. It was spinning around as if it did not know the way to the ground. It wanted to go somewhere higher, but it slipped on the ground. She crawled and crawled, up Gabrijelca's leg, onto her skirt, off her skirt onto her hand, and her hand right on the end of Gabrijelca's finger. No, she didn't bite her. <p/> As Gabrijelca was looking at her and she raised her finger to her eyes, the animal began to twist and turn. Then it lifted its two little caps, and spread its two transparent wings underneath, and it flew, high and far away - into the wide world. <p/> If only Gabrijelca could do all that! Her wing can barely stretch in the wind, but she cannot fly under the sky with it. Why is all this so? She would like to fly into the world that is for everyone... <p/> The animal was a ladybird. My father took a pen and wrote a poem after the ladybird. <p/> The little girl cries out to her. <p/> DRAGON <p/> In a hole in a wall made of big stones lived an animal - a little dragon. Perhaps he was the son of the great dragon that Ferdinand told us about. The little dragon was slipping from hole to hole, and supposedly had no other work to do. <p/> But a boy comes along with a bag. The dragon shows him his tongue and wants to go down the hole. The offended boy tears off his tail and puts it in his bag. <p/> But lo and behold: the next day, the little dragon shows his tongue again. The boy gets angry, tears off the tail and puts it in his bag. <p/> This is what the boy did on the third, fourth day of the holiday. When he had quite a few tails in his bag, he tied them together into one long tail, threw one end to a pig - over a cloud, climbed up on the cloud and looked at the world below him. He saw cities by the sea, ships and islands. So he sailed on a soft cloud around the world. And the sun warmed him so that he fell asleep. <p/> Apparently he was getting hungry. When he looked at the ground, he saw the old wall under him again. He crawled down on his bound tails towards the earth. He got to his feet right in front of the patisserie by the sea. He immediately ordered chocolate, blueberry and vanilla ice creams. He was about to bring it to his mouth when he woke up at home in bed. <p/> He wondered whether it was an illusion or the truth. <p/> BIRD <p/> If Gabrijelca wasn't allowed to have a puppy, she asked her mum and dad for a bird. One day, all three of them walked into a bird shop. <p/> Wow, there were so many cages and all kinds of parakeets: green, white and blue, and yellow, coloured and white canaries. And the turtledoves! They were hopping from stick to stick, swinging, flitting, climbing, chirping and singing to each other and huddling together in groups. Gabrijelca just opened her eyes, she would have loved to have them all, they were all equally cute. She chose the blue parrot, and my father had to reach into his pocket and they were marching with the little bird across the square and through the streets towards the idol. <p/> Mum set up the cage in the kitchen in the dining corner. My dad had told me to keep the cage open so that the bird wouldn't be locked in like a bandit. And it stayed that way. <p/> But the parakeet found nothing in the kitchen where he could sit down. It circled in the air in the shape of a figure of eight and landed on its cage, from where it surveyed its new surroundings, and when it got hungry or thirsty, it went to its home. <p/> Gabrijelca left the cleaning of the cage, the food and water to his mother and father. <p/> ""That's the way it is: children want something, but when they get it, they don't care about it anymore! "" the father declaimed. <p/> Gabrijelca waited for the parrot to start talking. She kept repeating some magic words to him, but the bird said nothing! The parrot, besides the cat, the dog, the horse and the elephant, must be an extremely clever witness, but you just have to understand it. And that they were poor birds who had to live in cigarette smoke and chirp to the company inside until midnight. He also thought that bird talk certainly meant nothing, because even human conversations often have no head or tail. He told Gabriélica to leave the bird alone, to behave itself. <p/> Well, he soon learned to fly on the toes of the atu. The atta brought an empty flower pot into the kitchen, which he liked to sit on and look around the kitchen, but he didn't like to go into the room. Over time, he would shriek if the tap dripped water, if the pot started to boil and when all three of them left the house. He watched carefully from a distance as his mother cleaned his cage. He also knew Gabrijelco and had become a member of the family. <p/> As Gabrijelca thought the bird was a bit lonely, she started to nag him to get a mate. One day, she and her mother brought home a brown-headed nuthatch. <p/> Dad looked down from under his forehead. But because he had had a dove when he was young, she was allowed to stay in the house. <p/> The parakeet was also looking at it from under his forehead. Curiosity or even jealousy drove him to visit the dove. Perhaps she was a threat to his kingdom. How he marvelled when the little bird tried to sing to him. He flew to her cage, tickled her with his beak and teased her until she ran out of the cage. Gentle and patient, she waited for her return, for the parrot to stop reigning on her chopsticks and eating her food. In the following days she wanted to return the visit, but she was not allowed in his cage. <p/> There was too much ghost on her throat, too much cleaning and worrying for both of them. Mum told Attu that one of the birds had to leave the house. <p/> ""The throat will have to go! "" the mother announced to Gabrijelci. Once, when her daughter wasn't home, she grabbed the cage and took it to the bird shop, saying: <p/> ""There you have it and keep it. Give it to whoever you want! ""And she was gone. <p/> The shop assistant was astonished. She watched for the strange woman, who disappeared down the nearest alleyway for hours. What was it about this lovely animal that she resented so much? What should she do with the bird: should she really give it away or sell it again? she thought. She had indeed sold it once. <p/> Dad had a few words of anger about Mum's hastiness. Mom just said: <p/> ""That's not the way it goes anymore! ""<p/> THE DEATH OF A DOG <p/> Four times Koki was very sad: when Gabrijelca went to the seaside with her mother and Ata for a holiday and he had to stay with strangers he didn't know and wasn't used to his new surroundings, even though he was doing well. <p/> But one day, at the beginning of his fifth year, he fell off his stick in his cage and lay on his back - dead. The zookeeper found that he had suffered a heart attack because his father had given him biscuits. All three of them mourned him. <p/> Gabrijelca respectfully buried the corpse, wrapped in newsprint, against the wall in the yard. She lined the grave with pebbles and placed a small wreath in the middle. <p/> One day, Gabrijelca cried convulsively. Through their tears, her father and mother found out that someone had vandalised Koki's grave, scattering flowers, a wreath and pebbles. She said she would complain about this barbarity at the residents' meeting. Her father and mother told her that if she told them that her Koki was buried in the grave, it must have been the naughty children who had done it. When her father asked her if Kokki's corpse had also been kicked out, she nodded and felt somewhat comforted. She herself went to dig him up and brought him to the balcony, where she buried him again in a flower trough, and on the new grave she put the first flowers of spring, and a new wreath, and stuck a wooden cross with a veil from one of her mother's dresses in the finger. One evening in mid-March, she lit two candles for him. The two little flames flickered beautifully, illuminating the walls of the balcony. <p/> The memory of Kokec lives on in the family. The corner where he made his home is now empty. They still feel that he will sing and fly on Gabrijelca's head.",Other,train
404,"Culture &gt; A moth's lunch <p/> No doubt, this is the show of a bookishly moody moth who will be thinking that today. He's been offered a slice of classic Australian literature to digest, from the pen of David Malouf, the multi-award-winning kangaroo, fiction writer, poet and novelist. The novel in question, An Imaginary Life, is one of the so-called postcolonial reads... <p/> To a random chimp like myself, it is easy to believe that the human imagination knows no bounds. Imagine, then, whose skin you would jump into, where you would fly to, if your thoughts did not keep crashing into the walls of reality. It would be nice to be a chicken in a world without a poultry industry, or a mediocre chair, immune to the jaws of a leech and the embrace of neurotically sweaty buttocks... maybe a piece of still-warm, newly born faeces... Imagine how popular they would be with the flies. What we would all be if our minds could defy change and not reflect shadows. The shadows of the moratorium of a postadolescence that persistently doubts. <p/> No doubt, this is the submission of a bookishly moody moth who will fancy that this is what it is today. He's been offered a slice of classic Australian literature to digest, from the pen of David Malouf, the multi-award-winning kangaroo, fiction writer, poet and novelist. The novel in question, An Imaginary Life, is one of the so-called postcolonial reads. The motif of the ascetic who ventures across a vast, mostly inhospitable landscape to find himself in the isolation of isolation is a frequent one in Australian literature. This motif has, in fact, developed into a national mythology, and has thus helped to shape Australian cultural identity, certainly among the white, immigrant population. Aborigines have an ascetic for lunch, just as Australians have kangaroos. <p/> Anyway, in The Imaginary Life we are placed in ancient times, in the shoes of the witty Roman poet Ovid, who is no ordinary, voluntary ascetic. We know from glimpses of his real life that he was the celebrated author of the Metamorphoses, a poet who knew how to articulate most beautifully the lazy decadence of his time, a man who not only moved in the heartland but was the very heart of Roman high society. And the heart is that missing part of the human toolbox which the then Emperor Augustus forgot when, for reasons unknown to us, he had Ovid exiled to the very edge of the Roman Empire, to an emergency civilised barbarian settlement. The unfortunate poet was left without bread, without games. And for him, the fiction is just beginning. <p/> In the emptiness of the desert landscape, Ovid of Maloof finds himself in profound silence, for Latin is not the barbarians' personal hygiene. The saddened poet is left with no choice but to put on his hair, roll in shit and surrender to the unbearability of silence. At this point, we find ourselves in the framework of a colonial discourse, which is expressed through the absence of a familiar environment, language and, consequently, an unresolved identity. <p/> The author thus focuses on the mental aporias and inner conflicts of the protagonist rather than on a narrative description of his surroundings. Here, however, the novel's multilayered nature gradually comes to the fore, leaving its central motif open to a multitude of interpretations. Is An Imaginary Life a novel about the search for identity and the importance of language in shaping it, a poetic reflection on the nature of life and death, on transcending boundaries in the landscape and in ourselves, on maturing through relationships with others? It leaves the layers of meaning to the horizon of imagination and thinking beyond the anxieties of civilisation. <p/> The cynicism of the cultivated poet Ovid, however, begins to diminish when he encounters the Child, a wild boy from the nearby forest. The little unsocialised hairy creature, who croaks, howls and generally disregards the behavioural patterns of the proudly standing specimens of modern homo sapiens, gradually reveals to him that civilisation is not an incurable disease. The story ends in an embrace of existentialist kitsch and pantheistic idealisations about nature. Flower children will thus be thrilled to read Imaginary Life. Lonely cowboys will be enlightened. Friends of trees will sprout leaves instead of hair. You'll want to ask a praying mantis out on a date.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

410,"Some time ago I decided to go in for rainwater tanks. Since I have a garden, and since last year - as usual - the water ran out, and I intend to enlarge the garden this year, I had no choice but to buy this thing and get water for the rainy days. First of all, I was looking at flea cisterns. Then I sent out some enquiries for new cisterns. Finally, I found black tanks, the price was good, and I bought two. As the seller was willing to bring the two tanks to me, I squeezed his hand for another EUR 10 for the transport and the deal was done. Then the work began. <p/> On the first day we dug up one huge bush. We not only dug it up, we also broke it down into several smaller ones and on the second day we planted these smaller bushes by the road in another part of the garden. The next day we dug up the ornamental grass and planted it also in smaller pieces in another part of the garden (nothing goes away here). On the third day, we dug the soil for the trellis I had imagined. As the ground is uneven and I want the cisterns to be higher than the ground, they had to be raised. On the fourth day we made the trusses and then waited five days for 4 euros so that we could buy two knees for the gutter and finish the job. <p/> We waited five days for those 4 euros... :) You don't know whether to laugh or cry. On Tuesday I went to the ATM to see if by any chance any virtual money had come in, and yesterday when I checked again, it said that the card was blocked. Oops... the money was in the account, but how to get it and what happened on that night from Tuesday to Wednesday, I wondered. Lo and behold, the execution from Durs arrived. The contributions for the Social Insurance Institution, which I hadn't paid by the due date. I knew that would be the case, but I was kind of hoping that I would get the EUR 600 I had left (I had already paid EUR 700) before they remembered me. The important thing is that I paid the loan and that I still have some money left for the essentials, and the EUR 120 that the banks have charged me for the blocking, the execution and the costs, I will also have to swallow. In short, when I got the 4 euros, we could finish the job. Thank you... <p/> I know, yes, the plastic is not very pretty to look at, but I'm going to do some studying. First I need to see how the inox or whatever is around this plate heats up, then I'll either just cover the tanks with bamboo or plant some ivy around it. In any case, it will not stay as it is.

415,"Origins <p/> Despite claims by the government of the People's Republic of China that Taiwan has always been part of China, its historical records do not record this. The earliest official records of Taiwan date back to the Three Kingdoms Period (222-280), when the first exploratory expedition of several thousand people was sent to the island from the Kingdom of Wu. However, in these records, Taiwan is identified as an area outside the boundaries of Chinese civilisation. When the island began to be colonised by foreign powers in the 16th century, the majority of the island's inhabitants were of Malayo-Polynesian origin, not of Han ethnicity. <p/>European trading bases (1624-1662) <p/>The first European conquerors to take an interest in Taiwan were the Portuguese, but they did not colonise the island. They called it Ihla Formosa, or Beautiful Island, and took the name with them to the world in the mid-16th century. The Dutch, who arrived from Indonesia and the Philippines in 1622, initially settled the Penghu Islands (Pescadores), where they established military rule. From there, they controlled maritime traffic in the Taiwan Strait and made passage difficult for Portuguese traders. In 1624, they were driven out by Ming troops and relocated to the main island of Taiwan. From Tainan, they dominated the south-western part of the island. The northern part of Taiwan was occupied by the Spanish conquistadors in 1626, but the Dutch drove them out in 1642. The Dutch government encouraged Chinese immigration to Taiwan because it needed a large labour force on the rice and sugar cane plantations. <p/>The Zheng family government (1662-1683) <p/> In China, Ming subjects fought against the Manchus, who gradually occupied China. In 1644, the Manchu Qing dynasty ruled China and the loyal Ming military forces fled to Taiwan. Commander Zheng Cheng-gong 鄭成功 (Koxinga), who had settled in northern Taiwan, continued to fight the Manchus for almost two decades, with the aim of re-establishing the Ming dynasty in China. After several unsuccessful battles in China, in 1661 he rebelled against the Dutch government in Taiwan and negotiated an agreement to take power. 1662 saw the establishment of the Kingdom of Dongning 東寧, which, after Koxinga's death, was ruled by a son and a grandson until 1683, when the Qing dynasty took power. At that time, Taiwan became administratively part of Fujian Province (臺灣府) and thus part of the multi-ethnic Manchu Empire of the Qing Dynasty. <p/> Qing Dynasty (1683-1895) <p/> During this period, thousands of poor Chinese immigrants came to Taiwan in search of a new start and a better life. Most of them were employed on cane and rice plantations, which were the main export commodities. As a result of the Opium Wars (between 1839-42 and 1856-60), 4 Taiwanese ports were opened to foreign traders, making Taiwan increasingly attractive in international trade. Taiwanese sugar, camphor, indigo and tea were highly sought-after export commodities. During the Sino-French War of Vietnam (1884-5), the northern part of Taiwan was occupied by the French and it was only then that the Chinese court slowly became aware of the vulnerability of the Chinese coastline to attack by foreign forces and the strategic role Taiwan played in this. The signing of the armistice between France and the Qing dynasty was followed by a reorganisation of the political administration, making Taiwan an independent province of the Qing Empire in 1885. The provincial capital is moved from Tainan to Taipei, and gradually Taiwan becomes much stronger. <p/>Japanese rule (1895-1945) in Taiwan and developments on the mainland<p/> In 1894, the Japanese invasion of Korea, which the Qing dynasty regarded as its tributary state, sparked the first Sino-Japanese War. Under the harsh terms of the Shimonoseki Peace Treaty of 1895, which formally ended the war, Taiwan, together with the Penghu Islands, was handed over to Japan. The people of Taiwan were disappointed by the dynasty's decision and tried to fight the Japanese invaders on their own. They established the Republic of Taiwan 臺灣民主國, which survived 5 months of fierce battles, from May to October 1895. <p/> During the 1950s, Japan carried out a systematic assimilation of the Taiwanese and rapidly developed the island's economy. Taiwan had by then developed the most modern industrial and transport infrastructure in Asia (except for Japan itself), which set the stage for Taiwan's further development. <p/> In China, however, disillusionment with Manchurian rule grew in the late 19th century. The political programme of the revolutionary Dr Sun Yat-sen (孫逸仙 Sun Yixian / 孫中山 Sun Zhongshan), who fought for the overthrow of the Manchurian monarchy of the Qing dynasty, gradually gained increasing popular support. His political ideals were summed up in a doctrine called the ""Three People's Principles"" 三民主義 (nationalism, democracy and national welfare), which aspired to an independent and democratic China. On 10 October 1911 (Xinhai Revolution 辛亥革命), Sun's military forces successfully captured the capital of Hubei province, Wuchang, and proclaimed secession from the Manchurian Qing dynasty. The revolution gradually engulfed the whole of central and southern China. These rebellious, south-central provinces declared independence and established an independent republic with Nanjing as its capital. The provisional government of the newly established Republic of China, headed by Sun Yatsen (his official enthronement as President on 1 January 1912 is considered as the founding day of the Republic of China and is still celebrated in Taiwan today), was very weak as the northern provinces were still loyal to the Manchurian Empire. In order to preserve national unity and avoid civil war, Sun renounced the presidency and offered it to the Northern Army General Yuan Shikai 袁世凱, who on 12 February 1912 obtained the abdication of the last Manchurian Emperor, Xuantong 宣統皇帝 (Puyi), ending the reign of the last dynasty in China. The Republic of China thus became the legitimate heir to the Qing territory, which at that time included Xinjiang, Tibet, Mongolia, and Manchuria (Taiwan was then still under Japan). Yuan Shikai soon disappointed the revolutionaries greatly. Instead of democracy and social reform, he sought to establish a new dynasty and the imperial throne, and to destroy the Party, thus completely flouting the Constitution of the Republic. Sun Yatsen therefore reorganised his alliance (the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance 中國同盟會) into the Chinese Nationalist Party 國 民 黨 (KMT). After a failed attempt at revolution again, he relocated to Japan, where he continued the revolution until Yuan's death in 1916. In 1917, he returned to Guangzhou and worked to reunite a completely fragmented China ruled by military strongmen. He founded the famous Huangpu 黃埔 (Whampoa) military academy, which became a centre for raising a revolutionary army to reunify China. After Sun's death (1925), General Chiang Kai-shek (蔣中正 Jiang Zhongzheng / 蔣介石 Jiang Jieshi) took supreme command of the army. In his famous three-year military expedition to northern China, Chiang defeated many feudal lords and annexed the military provinces to the rule of the Republic of China. In March 1927, Nanjing was restored as the capital of the Republic of China, and with the capture of Beijing in 1928, Chiang triumphantly completed the Northern Expedition. Power over China thus passed to the Nationalists, but unification did not bring lasting peace. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), founded in 1921 and initially working with Chiang, was gaining more and more strength, and the ideological tensions between the two parties were becoming increasingly insurmountable. China was increasingly threatened by the danger of a Japanese invasion. <p/> Japan launched an attack on Manchuria in 1931, establishing a puppet state known as Manzhuguo 滿洲國. The last emperor of the Qing dynasty, Puyi, was chosen as the formal leader. For reasons of national interest, the Communists and Nationalists then reunited to fight the Japanese forces, but the cooperation was merely symbolic and there was no genuine truce between the two factions. The incident between Japanese and Chinese troops at the Marco Polo Bridge near Beijing in 1937 led to the Second Sino-Japanese War, which lasted for eight years, until the end of the Second World War. After the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which ignited the Second World War, the Republic of China, which was on the side of the Allies, played the role of an important war front, receiving massive American aid. At the end of 1943, a declaration (the Cairo Declaration) was signed in Cairo by US President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and General Chiang Kaishek, in which the return of Manchuria, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands was assigned to the Republic of China. The Japanese surrender and the Postdam Declaration adopted in August 1945 gave legitimacy to the Cairo Declaration. The departure of the Japanese forces, however, refocused all the energies of the communists and nationalists on the battle for their own power. This gave the Chinese civil war full momentum. <p/>Republic of China power <p/> After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, the Nationalist ROK army, on behalf of the Allied Powers, invaded Taiwan and accepted the Japanese surrender. On 25 October 1945, Taiwan officially became part of the Republic of China. <p/> White Terror 白色恐怖 1945-1972 <p/> The Taiwanese people were very happy to see the restoration of ties with the mainland, the departure of the Japanese army and the arrival of representatives of the Nationalist ROK government. However, relations between the Taiwanese people and the new immigrants from the Chinese mainland soon became strained. The priority of the ROC government was the conquest of the whole of China, while Taiwan and the local population were not of paramount importance to the government of the time. The early period of the ROC government in Taiwan was marked by corruption, illegal land grabbing, inflation, outbreaks of infectious diseases and shortages of basic goods. All of this consequently led to one of Taiwan's greatest tragedies: the 228 二二八事件 Incident. The incident took place on 27 February 1947, when a woman illegally selling untaxed cigarettes on a street in Taipei was attempted to be punished by a group of police officers and agents of the Monopoly Bureau. The scuffle ended in a shoot-out in which a Taiwanese bystander was killed. Immediately, tensions arose between the discriminated civilian population on the one hand and the KMT civil servants on the other. <p/> The conflicts escalated into mass demonstrations, all of which were suppressed in blood. Thousands of Taiwanese, mainly educated people, were killed by government forces at the time. Although repression in the later period did not reach the level of 1947, political arrests and detentions were commonplace in Taiwan until the early 1970s. This period has therefore earned the name ""beil terror"". The incident planted the seeds of hatred between the locals and the newcomers, with far-reaching consequences for Taiwanese society. The newcomers made up only 15 % of the island's population, but for many years they maintained their superiority over the 85-strong native population. It was not until 1995 that the ROC-Nationalist Party government, headed by President Lee Teng-hui (李登輝 Li Denghui), formally apologised for the repression and passed a law to compensate all victims of the terror, declaring 28 February a public holiday two years later. <p/>ROC government relocation to Taiwan <p/> In 1949, the Nationalist troops in China were finally defeated. To escape the Communists, Chiang Kai-shek and his government took refuge in Taiwan with some 1.5 million supporters, where he established a new base for the R.C. On 1 October, Mao Zedong, the commander of the Communist troops, solemnly proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in Tiananmen Square. Thus was born the ""two Chinas"". Both governments, the PRC and the ROC, asserted their legitimacy over the territory of the whole of China. With the support of the USA, the ROC, as the legitimate representative of the whole of China, established close diplomatic relations with most of the democratic countries of the world and retained its seat at the United Nations until 1971, when the international situation turned in favour of the PRC. During this period, however, the political and economic development of the island, independent of the PRC, gradually transformed the Taiwanese people's self-conception of their identity and belonging.",Information/Explanation,train
416,"SLOVNI: Kylie, happy birthday! <p/> 28 May 2014 <p/> We are launching a special section on the Bansi website, featuring both local and foreign celebrities (actors, singers, directors, athletes and others). The feature will be launched by Australian singer, Kylie Minogue, who celebrates her birthday today. <p/> Kylie Minogue was born on 28 May 1968 in Melbourne, Australia. She rose to fame as an actress with her appearance in the Australian soap opera Neighbours. In 1987, she began her active music career in earnest, with her first released song ""Locomotion"" becoming a huge hit. Other tracks on her first album Kylie also became big worldwide hits (you can listen to the album here). <p/> She went on to sign a deal with a group of hugely successful producers, launching her to stardom and worldwide fame. <p/> Locomotion has been sung and danced all over the world. After a career spanning more than 25 years, Kylie is still often singing in concert. In a special classical (orchestral or acoustic) guise, she included it along with 15 others on the album "" The Abbey Road Sessions "". It is an album of her greatest hits, released in 2013, the 25th anniversary of her career. <p/> Kylie is a versatile artist, singer, actress, music video director, songwriter and has had around 6 perfumes released under her name. She is also a huge fashion enthusiast. This photo shows the launch of the book Kylie Fashion, which collects some of her outfits and costumes throughout her 25-year career. The book was published in October 2012. Did you know that Kylie was thinking about becoming a fashion designer when she was in her teens? In an interview, she said that her grandmother taught her how to sew and that fashion means a lot to her. When she started performing, singing and acting on stage completely took over and she was able to successfully integrate her love of fashion into her life. <p/> Kylie was and still is hugely popular throughout her native Australia, Asia, America and of course Europe. She has lived in London since the beginning of her music career, where she is ""literally crazy"", she is extremely popular in France, Spain and is often invited to perform on Italian television. She has already had eleven huge world tours and has performed practically everywhere in the world (Japan, China, Mexico, all over Europe, Asia, Africa, etc.). She has not yet visited Slovenia, although she has many fans here too. What is very interesting about Kylie is that she has never been too shaken by her worldwide fame, e.g. she has lost touch with reality, used illegal substances, been known for some strange affairs, etc. She is always very straightforward in interviews and does not give the impression of being unapproachable or shabby. She is also known for being called "" Cute Kylie "" by her friends, the presenters of the radio shows she regularly appears on, journalists and members of her team. <p/> She also has the characteristic that she "" keeps on recording "". No sooner has she released her "" official studio "" album than she has already released the accompanying singles, which are not included on the album, but her fans quickly find them and these songs also become big hits. To celebrate her 25th anniversary, which she celebrated throughout 2013, she played a total of five concerts in her native Australia (in Melbourne and Sydney) and in the UK (two in London and one in Mancherst), singing her best-known songs for her biggest fans, as well as those that have never been officially released on albums or as singles. The concerts were presented under the title Anti Tour and sold out immediately. <p/>A song that was a huge hit with her fans, yet was never released - Cherry Bomb i from the Anti Tour. <p/> In 2005, in the middle of her big (eighth in a row) Showgirl tour, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which devastated her immensely. Kylie underwent surgery and chemotherapy in Paris at her request. She recovered successfully from the disease and spoke about it very often in interviews, sometimes even crying during them. She returned to the stage with a major concert on 11 November 2006 in her native Australia (Sydney). <p/> Just in those days (26 May 2014), Kylie released a special single called "" Crystallize "", the proceeds of which go to the French cancer foundation Aprec. Kylie is also very often charitable, especially after her illness. <p/> The first single, "" Into the blue "", is from her latest twelfth studio album. <p/> Kylie's first album also features a duet with Jason Donovan. The song "" Especially for you "", which was a huge hit and is still considered one of the most romantic songs today. In this video, Kylie jokes around a bit and sings the song with Kermit the Frog from the Muppet Show. <p/> Kylie was one of the judges on the third series of The Voice (in 2013), a BBC TV show broadcast in London. It's a show that searches for new musical talent. Before that, she had performed in many countries (her native Australia, Italy, America, France, other British shows and more) in just such shows as ""Talent Search"". In this video from 2007, she is seen singing the song ""I believe in you"" with one of the (future) musical talents on the Star Academy show on French TV. Even today, Kylie does not ignore these invitations to appear on talent search shows and appears regularly. <p/> Her extremely extensive Aphrodite World Tour was the singer's eleventh concert tour, organised in promotion of her eleventh album, Aphrodite (2010). The tour took Kylie to Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and North America. This tour was technically of an extremely high standard, with the entire set of songs acting as a sing-dance-theatre show lasting around two hours. Kylie and her extensive team had around 80 concerts scheduled for the tour. The focus of the tour was Kylie as Aphrodite (goddess of love and beauty). The tour lasted from 19 February 2011 to 14 July 2011, almost day after day, with very few days off in between. A recording of the entire concert is also available online. <p/> Another performance from 2008 in one of the shows looking for new musical talent (Star Academy on French TV). Together with Mathieu, they sang one of her biggest hits "" Love At First Sight "". <p/> Anyone who hears Kyie's name is likely to immediately think of the song Kyie jokingly refers to as "" La, la, la "", the first single ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" from her eighth studio album Fever. The song was a hit worldwide and reached number one in more than 40 countries, including the UK, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and many other European countries. It has sold more than 4 million copies. Here we see a presentation of this song from the Brits Awards 2002, where Kylie won the award in the category "" International Female "" (Best Female Artist) in 2002. <p/> Another memorable performance with ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"". The performance received a lot of positive reviews, but it is from the 2011 MTV EMAs (MTV Europe Music Awards). <p/> Appearance on the X Factor in 2010, which is also one of the UK's shows looking for young musical talent. Kylie Minogue's sister, Danii Minogue, was one of the judges on the show. Kylie also made a music video for the song "" Better Than Today "", which she directed herself. <p/> Kylie and Danii Kylie sisters with the song Kids (originally sung by Kylie with Robbie Williams). The clip is from the Showgirl homecoming tour, a concert held in her hometown of Melbourne on 11 December 2006. It was one of Kylie Minogue's first major full-length performances after her treatment and diagnosis. <p/> Either way, Kylie is extremely active and successful. In an interview, she said that diligence is her most recognisable virtue and that she finds inspiration in every single thing. Today she celebrates her 46th birthday. Our editorial team would like to congratulate her.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

435,"For your consideration... <p/> I belong to that school of modern observers who believe that the world is at a turning point. In the course of history we have repeatedly lost confidence in eternal truths. Among them, in religion, in the State and in the world being flat. Today, we are giving up this trust to the market as we knew it until recently. The most radical language of new values and demands for a reorganisation of the system is spoken today by civil society initiatives. They do not see the existing model of market capitalism as the solution for a sustainable and just society. A new language is also being spoken by a growing part of the economy, which is adapting its business models, attitudes and value creation processes to values and co-creating them in dialogue with the needs of the people. Social and economic value creation processes are being reinvented, based on self-organisation, commodity exchange, participatory and democratic forms of ownership. The present is beginning to speak a language that holds the promise of radical change for the better. <p/> Not many people speak this language, but they are increasingly being heard. Because we all want to believe that something better is possible. Because we need to believe that better can always be (more) possible. <p/> We all understand part of this language. Some say it is useless, that it is outdated. Others believe that it can only partially explain and justify the needs of modern society. Still others add new slogans to enrich it and throw out concepts that do not belong. We seem to be reassembling the alphabet of the world. And, given the current indicators of the overall balance sheet, this is more than necessary. What this alphabet will bring will be determined by the concrete actions and changes that this new language will trigger. We can still hope that we are living in times of change. <p/> As we write this first blog entry, it is also our first text entry dedicated to the online community that has started to coalesce in recent months around the people who co-create the Vive mission [ 1 ]. In the period behind us, this community has taken small but courageous steps towards the goal of a better life that defines us as a collective, as collaborators, as colleagues, as friends, as a community. While we are aware that we could not have set ourselves a broader goal than a better life, we are slowly realising that this goal has very clear trajectories. <p/> In the process of defining our values, fleshing out our goals and strategising our work plan, we have continually stumbled over the breadth of the notion of a better life. What values bind us together as a community of colleagues? Which values are those that represent our minimum common denominator? How do we offer something truly new, something that is our product, in a crowd of organisations, ideas and activities that all promise us a better life? <p/> If, after this paragraph, you think that we have found all the answers, we must disappoint you. We haven't. Not all of them, anyway. But we are learning, every day, that there is incredible potential in our neighbourhood, from individuals with extraordinary ideas and innovative skills. That many organisations, initiatives and companies are making an invaluable contribution to the quality of life for all of us. These are all those who are working in different ways to create a world based on a just economy, who are breathing for us to eat better, healthier and fairer food, who believe that we have the right to a better democracy and for whom health is a right, not just an individual responsibility.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

438,"The report (Feasibility study - Towards a mobility scoreboard: Conditions for Learning Abroad in Europe) contains a set of proposed indicators focusing on conditions to promote learning mobility in higher education. The Eurydice network has been commissioned by the European Commission to develop a set of indicators to monitor this process, as Member States committed themselves to promoting mobility and removing barriers to learning mobility through a Recommendation of the EU Council of Ministers in 2011, and the report represents the network's first attempt to establish framework indicators to monitor this process. <p/> The report focuses on the contextual conditions that enable, promote or hinder mobility. The study compares the situation in European countries with regard to the state of planning for learning mobility, the provision of advice and support, financial support for mobility, the portability of scholarships, foreign language teaching and language preparation, the recognition of study abroad, the special attention paid to disadvantaged groups of learners, and so on. <p/> The report covers data from 33 countries (all 28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey). The reference year for the data in the report is 2011/12. The Network plans to publish the report every two years. <p/> The new report Physical Education and Sport at School in Europe outlines the state of play of physical education and sport activities in schools in 30 European countries. The report covers primary and secondary levels of education and offers insights into the following topics: - national strategies and broad initiatives where they exist, - the status of physical education in national curricula and guidance documents, - recommended class time for physical education and sport activities, - assessment of pupils, - teacher training, - activities outside the compulsory curriculum, and - planned national reforms.

The work was carried out from 19 June to 15 July 2006 as part of the compulsory field course for archaeology students. <p/> The house, known as Vodiškar's House, stands on the edge of the terrace of the Nevljica stream. The oldest part of the building, the house, is built of wooden logs and is dendrochronologically dated to between 1580 and 1600. The wooden structure is set on a stone cellar, which is dug into the bank. In the 18th or 19th century, a stone vestibule with a black kitchen and a room or stiblc was added to the east of the house. The whole, now three-part building was then plastered. The building was covered with a thatched roof, which was removed in the 1970s. Due to the poor load-bearing capacity of the walls, the new roof was supported on free-standing concrete piers on the north and west sides. <p/> In 2004, as part of the planned renovation of the outside of the building, the owners machine-excavated drainage ditches along the walls and removed the plaster on the wooden part of the building. A larger, irregularly shaped construction pit was dug along the west façade of the building, which extended below the level of the basement foundations. One or more cultural layers were removed, which contained a large number of pottery fragments dating from the High Middle Ages, animal bones and charcoal. However, large quantities of modern pottery, glass shards and metal objects were found throughout. <p/> Archaeological excavations were then carried out prior to the resumption of construction works, but were limited to a few selected small areas due to the previous destruction of the stratification and for static reasons. <p/> The southern part of the stile was partially excavated, where the owners had already removed the weathered wooden floorboards before the excavations began. Under two layers of fill with finds from the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, we found a light brown screed of sand, soil and lime up to 6 cm thick. It showed clear signs of wear and was smeared with mud and soot from the Black Kitchen. It was laid directly on the sterile subsoil of the site, which consists of thick gravel and sand deposits. The foundations of the stone walls of the shingle were shallowly dug into it, only about 10 cm deep. Small finds suggest that the hill was built over in the 18th or early 19th century. A test excavation in the courtyard along the eastern wall of the fortress showed that the courtyard had been flattened when the fortress was built, thus completely destroying the older stratification. <p/> The area in front of the wooden door along the north wall of the house, the presumed original entrance to the building, was also investigated. The strip between the wall of the house and the roof struts was filled in and partially levelled with thick stones, sand, building materials and household waste when the new roof structure was built in the 1970s. Below were some earth layers associated with the construction of the extension with the black kitchen and the tiled stove. The foundation of the stone wall behind the pottery oven was dug 50 cm deep through the thick rubble of an 80 cm wide dry wall, which ran parallel to the northern wall of the cellar or house at a distance of 1.40 m. The wall may have formed the foundation of an enclosed extension next to the house or may have merely served as a truss to consolidate and level the walking surface in front of the former entrance to the building. To the north of the wall, we documented two wooden uprights, possibly supporting the pitched roof, the existence of which is evidenced by three cut-outs for the supporting beams in the north wall of the house. The excavated wall and the stone wall of the cellar were dug into the sterile base of the site. To the north of the drystone wall, several successive earth deposits with numerous modern finds were excavated. In the westernmost part of the excavation site we documented several layers overlying the bank here, containing fragments of High Medieval pottery. <p/> The large machine excavation in front of the cellar entrance on the west side of the building was only cleaned and levelled due to the static threat to the west wall of the cellar. In the western profile, we documented, among other things, three layers with High Medieval finds. The pottery is virtually identical to the finds from the older phase of the castle at Malé grad in nearby Kamnik and can be tentatively dated to the 11th or 12th century, the time when the village of Nevlje, next to the old parish church, began to develop.",Information/Explanation,train

452,"While enjoying a stroll through the colourful streets of Burano at the end of April, I was interrupted by a telephone call from Stojan asking 'Hi, Momak. Would you like to go to Mont Blanc? "" Although it was already warm in summer, I froze for a moment. My answer was yes. An old holiday must be made the most of. If it is an active one, so much the better. <p/> After all the coordination, Polona, Stojan and I are finally part of a mini-team that monitors the weather forecast over Shamonix and gathers information on a daily basis. On Monday, we make a quick decision to leave on the morning of Tuesday 13 May... from rainy Ljubljana. We set off for Italy, past Venice, Milan, towards Aosta and through the tunnel under Mont Blanc to Chamonix. On the way, we have a coffee on the Italian autostrada with Klemen, who is going to the same places on business as a mountain guide. <p/> In the evening we arrive in a still cloudy town under snow-capped peaks. You can't see the peaks, but you can feel the cold of the glaciers. <p/> In the evening we are in the same hostel as Klemen Gričar and Tomaž Jakofčič, ""gasterbajters"" with a lot of experience up there. They give us selfless advice and answer all our questions. <p/> Our original plan was to take the gondola on Wednesday to the Aiguille di midi, 3842 metres high, from where we would ski down the Vallee Blanche and do a tour to the Torino hut, where we would spend the night. On Thursday, the plan was to ski down the Valee Blanche to Montevers and then take the cog railway back to Chamonix. <p/> On Friday we planned to ride again to the Aiguille di midi mid station, and from there climb up to the Gran Mulets hut, and on Saturday night start for the summit. The weather forecast for Saturday was also promising. <p/> Polona, at the suggestion of Klemena, checked the reservation at the Gran Mulets hut and was informed that we had a reservation from Thursday to Friday. Apparently the dec up there had written the date wrong when the first booking was made. <p/> The combination of days, times, reservations starts. In the end, we come to the conclusion that we will climb up to the Torino hut on Wednesday, descend into the valley on Thursday and immediately climb back up and to the Gran Mulet hut. Well, the plan is one thing, the reality is another. <p/> When we arrive at the Aiguille di Midi lookout, we do not even get a panoramic view, let alone the conditions for skiing on glaciers covered with 30 cm of fresh snow. Fog and clouds obscure the peaks and descend to the valley. This time the weathermen have kicked the darkness. <p/> This is this from the acclimatisation tour. Unfortunately, we descended to the valley by gondola. <p/> On Thursday we finally wake up to a clear morning. <p/> We take the gondola up to 2,310 m, to the Plan de l'Aiguille, and from there ski under the north face of the Aiguille de midi towards the Gran Mulets hut. <p/> Soon, the full majesty of the mountains and glaciers is revealed. <p/> The sun is already warming up strongly, but the ice sculptures are still mighty. <p/> Before crossing the Bosson at the Jonction section, we take narrow bridges over glacial crevasses to reach the flank below the Gran Mulets hut, which stands on top of a rocky ridge. <p/> From here, the Aiguille di midi is visible from the other side, with Chamonix below. <p/> On the other side of the flank, icebergs glisten in the sun. <p/> At the bottom of the hut, we take off our skis and follow the carved path up to the hut, chain and rope in tow. <p/> In the hut, we settle into our shared beds and wait for dinner. While we wait, I do a few laps around the house... <p/> Next to the hut is a building which, if it had water in it, could be called a toilet. So it can only be called a ""shithole"" with a capital R, as the ""septic tank"" is down there on a glacier somewhere. <p/> Prayer flags colour the day. <p/> The sun slowly goes to rest, and up here the real show of light and colour begins. First, the snow expanses take on a whole new hue with soft shadows... <p/> The wind doesn't let up up there. <p/> A ball of fire will slowly hide under the clouds. <p/> The permafrost under the hut ensures a constant climate. <p/> And it's... day. My 44th , ... birthday. It was beautiful. <p/> When the sun hadn't even set, we were all in bed ... by 3am. Then up, breakfast, a night descent along the chain and rope to the snow below the hut and a start in the glare of headlamps to the summit. <p/> We walk in the dark on the groomed spur for a good while before the day begins to wake up. The lights are still burning in the town ... <p/> It starts with blue light up here ... <p/> Slowly the outlines of the hills turn into colourful pictures. <p/> The glaciers remain cold despite the first warm rays of the sun ... <p/> ... and the crevasses beneath the Dôme du Goûter are menacing. <p/> And when you look around, everything is still so beautiful that it couldn't be more beautiful. <p/> The valley is slowly waking up while it's coldest up here. <p/> You talk to the clouds and the nettles and ask them to let the sun go ... <p/> And the top is so close ... and far away at the same time. <p/> The last metres below the Vallot bivouac are pretty blown. The skis go on the ruzak, and instead of skis, I mount the crampons on my feet. The breath was getting deeper here, but there was no real strength in my legs. After a good five hours of walking we reach the bivouac. <Polona and Stojan are already at the bivouac when I get there. Looking down ... <p/> ... towards Mont Maudit ... <p/> ... and towards the one we came for. <p/> Ahead of us, there are already a few convoys going at a slow pace towards the summit. <p/> There is some hesitation about whether to go with or without skis towards the summit. In the end, we decide to go without. Meanwhile, Klemen continues past the bivouac with his team. <p/> We follow a little way behind him. After a few hundred metres, I realise that my lungs are straining almost to empty and my muscles simply don't have enough energy anymore. The pace is getting slower and slower, and at this rate we would have blown our timetable for the descent. There is no alternative but to turn around. I give Stojan and Polona a clear path to the top, but they decide to descend. <p/> Meanwhile, the wind picks up a bit up there. <p/> We continue to enjoy the views as we prepare for the descent. <p/> The summit will wait ... until next time. Meanwhile, one team is already skiing down the north side of the mountain. <p/> Another hello to the summit, and then the descent. <p/> For the first few pitches the snow is hard, blown, icy in places, and so are the muscles. I stop several times, trying to enjoy at least the views <p/> Below the bivouac, the skiing is better. The only distraction from carefree powder is the thought that we are near and on a glacier, and that there are glacial crevasses hiding under the snow. The fact that the previous day a mountaineer fell into a crevasse fifteen metres deep also gives us food for thought. He was lucky in the accident, as he was pulled to safety unharmed by helicopter rescuers. <p/> During our stops, we admire the snow and ice masses, so innocently white, yet menacing and dangerous. <p/> We ski towards the approach. The snow becomes a little crusty in places, a little heavier lower down, but still skiable. <p/> Soon we are above the Grand Mulets hut. <p/> We cross the Bossons over the Jonction, strung up. We are not the only ones. Somehow we are skiing at the same time with two Spaniards and a group of Austrians. <p/> The sun is already quite strong down here and it is not very pleasant to wait in line to cross the glacier. We are quickly across, then under the northern walls of the Aguilla di Midi we continue our way to the middle station of the gondola. <p/> The crossing is rather protracted, more so than the other way round, as we have some work to do. Finally, the greenery of the valley and the gondola come into view. <p/> We arrive in Chamonix in the afternoon, beautifully tired, hungry and thirsty. Maybe even a little disappointed. But, all the same, we have reached an altitude of 4362 m, skied down from there and arrived in the valley alive and well. For one of this year's final tours, that will be a big enough success <p/> P.S. Apparently, the summit is still where it was before we wanted to climb it ourselves. And I think it will be there for a while... waiting... maybe for us too <p/> One more thing about the costs: after the tour, we took a free afternoon in Chamonix, spent the night, and then headed home the next morning. <p/> For the trip from Tuesday to Saturday, for tolls, tunnel fees, fuel, accommodation and gondola tickets, we each spent just over 300.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

465,"The Core <p/> If at the time of entering into the contract of conveyance the conveyancer was aware of the legal consequences of entering into the contract of conveyance and had the will to enter into the contract of conveyance, the conveyancer will be deemed to have had the capacity at the time of entering into the contract of conveyance to enter into such a contract. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The appeal is allowed and the judgment of the Court of First Instance is modified so that the defendants are obliged to issue to the plaintiff, within 15 days, a land registration deed on the basis of which the plaintiff will be entitled to register the land in respect of the immovable properties No 83 of the Land Register No D. and No 756 of the Land Register No D. and No 756 of the Land Register No D. on their co-ownership interests, in order to register the title in his own name, since such a deed would otherwise be superseded by the present judgment, and to reimburse him, within 15 days, the costs of the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, amounting to EUR 5 930,52, with interest at the statutory rate of late payment, with effect from the 16th day following the date of receipt of the present decision, in the event of delay. <p/> The defendants are ordered to reimburse to the applicant, within 15 days, EUR 1 572,03 of the costs of the appeal, with interest at the statutory rate from the 16th day following receipt of this decision until payment. <By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action for the issue of a land registry deed in respect of immovable properties No 83 of the Land Register of D. and No 756 of the Land Register of D. in the applicant's name, finding that the contract of conveyance of 19 September 1994 between the conveyancer, Mrs I.F., and the applicant was null and void. It is void because, at the time of the conclusion of the contract of assignment, Mrs F. was not capable of understanding the meaning and consequences of the contract of assignment (she lacked capacity to act). <p/> 2. Against the judgment of the Court of First Instance, the applicant appeals on all the grounds set out in Article 388(1) of the Civil Procedure Act, seeking an amendment of the judgment so as to uphold the claim, and, in the alternative, to set aside the judgment and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. The appeal challenges the finding of the Court of First Instance that, at the time of the conclusion of the contract of assignment, Mrs I.F. was not capable of understanding the meaning and consequences of the contract of assignment. Ms F's capacity to act is presumed and the defendants have not challenged that presumption. The mere existence of the disease of senile dementia is not proof that she did not understand the meaning of the contract of assignment. Expert B. was of the opinion that there was an 80 % probability that Mrs F.I. did not understand the meaning of the contract of assignment. On the basis of that expert's opinion, the presumption of the existence of Ms I. F.'s capacity to act is not rebutted. In the light of the circumstances, Mrs I.F.'s capacity was more or less preserved and she is able to express what she wants to do with her assets. <p/> 3. In their reply to the application, the defendants submit that a piecemeal, piecemeal assessment of the evidence cannot lead to the desired result that Ms I.F. had the capacity to act at the time of the signing of the contract of assignment. The Court of First Instance is autonomous in its assessment of the evidence. The emphasis on the bright moments of the handing-over of Mrs I.F. cannot be placed in the timeframe of the conclusion of the handing-over contract, since, apart from the date of conclusion of the handing-over contract, we do not know what state of mind Mrs F.I. was in when she concluded the handing-over contract. Expert B.B. did not conclude that Mrs F. I. was in a lucid phase at the time of the conclusion of the contract. Mrs F.'s will was not entirely free, as it was quite suggestible, but the proceedings have not proceeded in that direction so far because the parties have not claimed that it was. The expert, Mr B.B., did not speculate. He confirmed that his findings were correct, which means that I.F. was incompetent at the time of the conclusion of the contract of delivery. The plaintiff did not attend the hearings, which suggests that there was something wrong with the contract from the outset. <p/> 4. The Court of Appeal questioned the correctness of the Court of First Instance's assessment of the evidence and therefore held a main hearing, at which it repeated the evidence of the expert Dr Z. Č. At the time of the conclusion of the contract of delivery on 19 September 1994, Mrs F. was of legal age and therefore presumed to have had the capacity to act. It is for the defendant to prove that at the time of the conclusion of the contract of entrustment she lacked capacity, that she did not understand the meaning of the conclusion of the contract of entrustment and that she lacked the capacity to form the will to conclude the contract of entrustment. <p/> On the basis of the expert opinions of Dr. Z. Č. T. and Dr B.B., the testimony of the witness J.B. and the actions of I.F. after the conclusion of the contract of assignment (her statement at the Centre for Social Work Jesenice on 12.10.1994, the conclusion of the lease agreement on 14.12.1994 and the consequences of the dementia from which I.F. suffered), the Court of First Instance concluded that I.F. did not understand the nature of the contract which she had concluded with the claimant on 19.09.1994 and its legal consequences. The Court of Appeal takes a different view of that evidence, in particular because the experts fundamentally misinterpreted the statement made by Mrs F. before the Centre for Social Work Jesenice on 12.10.1994 and incorrectly linked that statement to the lease agreement concluded between Mrs F. and the applicant on 14.12.1994. <p/> It is clear from Ms F.'s statement of 12.10.1994 that she was aware that she had already handed over the property to the applicant (I myself wanted D.J. to have everything I had). I want him to have all my property after my death, or rather to have it already now. I.F. was also aware of why she was giving her property to the claimant, because he takes care of her and will continue to take care of her in the future (because he takes care of me, he is very good and I think he will continue to do so in the future). <p/> She also testified that her relatives are not interested in her or that they come to help her when they can and that they cannot come often. It follows from this statement that she wanted the continued assistance which the applicant had provided and had undertaken to provide in the future. <p/> It follows from Mrs F.'s statement that she understood the meaning of the contract of delivery of 19.09.1994, that she was handing over all her property to the applicant, and that she wished to enter into such a contract of delivery, that is to say, to form a business will to enter into such a contract, on the ground that the applicant would take care of her in the future. <p/> The experts' view that it is not logical that, after the conclusion of the contract of conveyance, I.F. and the applicant also concluded a lease contract on 14.12.1994 for an apartment on the first floor of the house is not justified, since at the time of the conclusion of the lease contract the contract of conveyance had not yet been registered in the land register and therefore the applicant had not become the land registry owner of the property conveyed. The conclusion of the lease contract is therefore a logical act, since by concluding it the applicant acquired the legal title to live in the house. When it was suggested to the experts that the conclusion of the lease agreement was logical, they replied that this was a legal view, not a psychiatric one. The court is not persuaded by such an answer of the experts. The logic of the transactions entered into is interpreted in terms of the need to enter into those transactions. Since the plaintiff had not yet acquired the legal title to live in the I.F. house by the mere conclusion of the contract of delivery, and the procedure for obtaining the status of farmer for the plaintiff had been delayed, it is logical and understandable that the plaintiff secured the right to live in the I.F. house by concluding the lease. <p/>Expert Dr. Z. Č. T. and Dr B. B. thus erred in considering that the subsequent conclusion of the lease contract implies that Mrs I.F. was not aware of the meaning of the contract of handover and that she was not capable of forming the will to enter into the contract of handover. The experts' request that Mrs F. should have stated in her statement of 12 October 1994 that she had already concluded the contract of usufruct is too strict, but in her statement Mrs F. testified to the essential elements of the contract of usufruct, namely that the property was already in the possession of the applicant and that the latter would take care of it in the future. <p/> Since it is clear from Mrs F.'s deposition of 12.10.1994 that she was aware of the importance of the contract of conveyance and that she wished to enter into it, it can be safely concluded that she also had such a wish on 19.09.1994, when she concluded the contract of conveyance. That will or capacity was not affected by her illness, dementia of old age, particularly in the light of the report on her state of health by Dr J.K. of 15.11.1994, in which he responded to enquiries made by the Centre for Social Work concerning the state of I.F.'s health. in which he stated that she was oriented in terms of personality, location and time, and the letter of 22.11.1994 from the nurse responsible for her care, Ms J.B., in which she stated that she had visited Ms I.F. four times since March 1994 and that she considered her to be of sound mind and health for her age. However, at the hearing on 19.11.2007, J.B. testified that she remembered I.F. as a confused, demented person who could no longer look after herself and needed help. When J.B.'s letter of 22.11.1994 was read to her, she stated that she remembered the case well at the time, but today she remembers I.F. as she described her at the hearing. It should be borne in mind that she had visited her 10 times, i.e. that she had continued to visit her even after she had made her statement of 22.11.1994. Her statement at the hearing is therefore not contradicted by the letter of 22.11.1994, it is only the timeframe to which the statement refers that is relevant. It follows from the statement of 22.11.1994 that this statement refers to the time up to the date of the statement, whereas the statement at the hearing on 09.11.2007 refers to the entire memory of her. <p/> Expert B.B. explained that confusion in dementia occurs in intervals of varying length, which means that a person with dementia is not mentally confused between the intervals. He was of the opinion that I.F. did not understand the meaning of the contract of conveyance at the time of the conclusion of the contract of conveyance, which he gave with a probability of 80 %. Such an opinion by Dr B.B. does not, therefore, rebut the presumption that Mrs F. had capacity at the time of the conclusion of the handover contract of 19 September 1994. For that reason, it is also not possible to follow the opinion of the expert Z. Č. T., that at the time of the conclusion of the handover contract I.F. was incapable of understanding the meaning of the handover contract, since both opinions are based on the same assessment of the facts, only that they ultimately assess them differently. <p/> As regards the testimony of the other parties and witnesses, it should be made clear that they gave their testimony as they saw and perceived it when they were in contact with Ms I.F.. However, in view of her illness, age-related dementia, which occurs at intervals, this may have been in a phase of confusion or in a phase of lucidity and therefore cannot affect the assessment of the evidence itself, given that it can be concluded with certainty from her statement before the Social Work Centre on 12.10.1994 that she was aware of the significance of the handover contract and that she had the will to form the basis of such a handover contract of 19.09.1994. <p/> 7.

The applicant was successful in the proceedings and must therefore reimburse the defendants for the costs of the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, which are assessed at a total of EUR 5 930,52 (EUR 3 474,83 for the costs of legal representation and EUR 2 474,83 for the costs of the lawyer).455,69 for fees, expert fees and travel costs), and to reimburse him EUR 1 572,03 in respect of the costs of the appeal (EUR 492,60 in respect of the appeal fee, EUR 407,59 in respect of the costs of drafting the notice of appeal, EUR 331,58 in respect of the costs of attending the main hearing on 14 February 2011 and EUR 340,26 in respect of the costs of the expert). <p/> The defendants shall pay the costs of the proceedings to the applicant within 15 days, with default interest at the statutory rate from the 16th day following receipt of this decision.",Legal/Regulation,train
466,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are usually transmitted through sexual contact. <p/> Formerly known as venereal diseases (syphilis, gonorrhoea, soft chancre and inguinal lymphogranuloma), STDs are now commonly divided according to the agents that cause them. <p/> General protection against STDs is abstinence, fidelity to two uninfected partners, or the use of barrier contraceptives, the best known of which is the condom. There is also a female version of the condom called femidon, but it is practically impossible to buy in Slovenia. <p/> The condom is the only contraceptive that both protects against the transmission of sexually transmitted pathogens and prevents unwanted pregnancy. <p/> The most common sexual infections are fungal and bacterial infections, which most often present in women as vaginal discharge, genital itching, burning pain when urinating. However, many sexually transmitted infections occur without any signs of infection or disease problems (asymptomatic infections). <p/> The possibility of infection should always be kept in mind when having sex. If sex is based on a good knowledge of the partner and mutual trust and fidelity, there is no risk of fresh infection. Of course, the risk is much higher with frequent changes of sexual partners and fleeting sexual contacts (promiscuous sexual behaviour). <p/> Some STIs are briefly described below, while HIV/AIDS, chlamydial infections and hepatitis are covered separately. <p/> Gonorrhoea (also gonorrhoea, thrips) Gonorrhoea is a widespread STD caused by gonococcus. It has seemingly, but unjustifiably, lost its importance due to the success and short duration of treatment. There is no data on the actual prevalence of gonorrhoea for Slovenia because the notification, which is compulsory, is incomplete. <p/> Gonorrhoea is sexually transmitted and mainly affects the genital organs. However, there is also gonorrhoea of the conjunctiva of newborn infants, which is contracted during childbirth if the parturient has gonorrhoea. Therefore, to prevent this type of infection, it is obligatory to protect every newborn with so-called Crede's drops at birth. It is also possible for gonococci to infect other sites outside the genitals and genital tract (buttocks, throat). In the male, after a short incubation period of a few days (i.e. the time between infection and the outbreak of the disease), a discharge from the urethra occurs, accompanied by itching and burning pain when urinating. After about 2 weeks, the acute inflammation becomes chronic. Complications of untreated gonorrhoea in a man include inflammation of the prostate, perimenopause and infertility. <p/> In women, there is virtually no disease in the initial period. There are no early signs of possible infection. <p/> Infection progresses to the internal reproductive organs (uterus, fallopian tubes), which can lead to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. <p/> Syphilis Syphilis is a contagious STD that can affect all organs of the human body. The causative agent of syphilis is a bacterium, Treponema pallidum. More than 95 infections are caused by having sex with an infected person. Non-sexual infections are caused by kissing, biting and other contact with a patient who has skin sores. <p/> Data on the prevalence of syphilis are fairly accurate, as the disease was considered the most severe STD due to its consequences until the emergence of HIV infection. In Slovenia, a dramatic increase in syphilis was recorded in 1994 and 1995 (36-38 per year), with a slight decline in the number of new cases in the following years. <p/> Syphilis is divided into early and late (duration up to 1 year or more than 1 year), and acquired and congenital, depending on how the infection occurred. <p/> The incubation period for syphilis is about 3 weeks. <p/> Early syphilis At the site of penetration of the bacterium into the skin or mucous membranes, a hard, hard-edged, round or oval ulcer forms after three days. The ulcer is most often on the genitals, but can also be on the lips or in the oral cavity. After a few days, the lymph nodes in the area swell, and after 2 months, most of the lymph nodes swell. Later, an itchy rash spreading from the trunk to the extremities appears, which spontaneously disappears after 1 to 2 months, leaving whitish patches. Several months after infection, hair loss may occur with coin-sized bald patches that grow back on their own. <p/> Late syphilis In this form, there are not necessarily changes in the skin, but there are changes in the blood vessels and central nervous system. The disease is proven and later controlled by detecting antibodies in the patient's blood or cerebrospinal fluid. <p/> Congenital syphilis A syphilitic infection in the mother can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, or a child may be born with signs of syphilis. The last case of congenital syphilis in Slovenia was reported in 1986. <p/> It is important to detect syphilis as early as possible to prevent the spread of infection and to increase the success of treatment. The drug of choice is still penicillin. <p/> INFECTIONS WITH PAPILLOMA VIRUSES-GENITAL WARTS Some of the viruses belonging to the papillomavirus group cause genital warts (HPV 6 and HPV 11). The incubation period can be several months. The lesions themselves are harmless (benign), but they are very disturbing, uncomfortable, the treatment is long and painful, and recurrences are frequent. <p/> GENITAL HERPES Infection with herpes simplex type 2 is classified as an STD. The infection causes the formation of tiny vesicles on and around the genital area, which later become purulent. The vesicles appear in the presence of various triggering factors (immunosuppression, stress, illness, menstruation). <p/> Initially, there are only bubbles, but later small sores appear. <p/> Infection with the virus is permanent. If a pregnant woman who has a fresh infection gives birth to a child, she may be at high risk. If symptoms are present at the time of delivery, a caesarean section is performed to prevent infection of the newborn. <p/> Treatment of skin lesions is symptomatic. However, there are antiviral drugs that prevent the appearance of vesicles in people with a high incidence of genital herpes. These medicines are prescribed by a doctor. <p/> FUNGAL INFECTIONS Fungal infections of the genital tract are most commonly caused by fungi of the genus Candida, which are present in small numbers on mucous membranes. They often multiply on the mucous membranes of the female genital mucosa and are passed on during sexual intercourse. Men usually do not have problems, but may develop burning, reddish, partly whitish, penile rashes. <p/> In women, the genital area usually itches, the mucous membrane is red and there is a white, cheesy vaginal discharge. <p/> Creams and vaginal tablets are used for treatment. <p/> Pubic lice Pubic lice live on the hair of the genitals and are transmitted by sexual contact. Lice and nits are found on the hairs. Severe itching occurs. All infected persons must be treated and bed linen must be properly hygienised (wash at 95 degrees C). <p/> CHLAMIDIA INFECTIONS Data on the prevalence of chlamydia infections in Slovenia are unreliable. Despite the fact that it is compulsory to report the infection and that chlamydial infections are among the most common STDs, reporting is not practiced. Chlamydia are very small bacteria, sexually transmitted by Chlamydia trachomatis. <p/> In men, urethral and later perineal inflammation occurs after about 14 days after infection. However, an infected male may be without problems. <p/> Newborn babies become infected at birth if their mother has chlamydia cervicitis. Chlamydia eye inflammation and/or chlamydial pneumonia develop. <p/> The infection is treated with antibiotics. <p/> TRYHOMONIAZA Infection is caused by a protozoan, Trichomonas vaginalis. <p/> In men there is usually no problem, rarely there is inflammation of the urethral orifice and burning pain on urination. In women, after incubation for a few days, a foul-smelling, foamy vaginal discharge appears, accompanied by itching of the external genitalia and pain on urination.",Information/Explanation,train
469,"Tenancy agreement with a person in social need <p/> QUESTION: <p/> We are going to rent out a room in a block of flats with shared use of the bathroom and kitchen to a father of two children (14 and 12 years old). As they are a social problem (no income, in divorce proceedings, etc.), I would like to know how to draw up the "" correct "" rental contract with the father for a period of 12 months or so to solve his problems. Can I throw them out of the house after 12 months, even though they are a social problem? What if something happens to the father, what happens to the children? What if something happens to me and my husband (our children are still of age)? Is the tenant obliged to pay my housing costs? <p/> (D.K.F.) <p/> ANSWER: <p/> We understand from the question that you are renting out the accommodation yourself, not as a social institution. However, vacating the premises by the tenant always involves risks, so we advise you to rent the premises for a fixed period of time, e.g. 12 months, as you say. Before the end of the lease, you should re-let the premises for a longer period. Of course, there is still some risk, especially in your case. Find out whether he will be able to pay you rent at all if he has no income. Consider whether you can approach him to get a rent guarantee from social services if you are really solving social problems. If he has no income and no guarantee, you are of course knowingly increasing your risk. If something happens to the father (the tenant), then the children who have been living with him will continue to rent and the welfare authority will take care of their rights. The costs of the tenancy are paid by someone other than the tenant, and it is advisable to obtain insurance - preferably a guarantee from the social welfare authority - to cover the tenant's obligations.If something happens to you, this has no effect on the tenancy, which is continued by your heirs.",Other,train

491,"News <p/> At a discussion evening in Novo mesto, Roma assistants said that the scope of their work exceeds the stipulated 4 hours a day and that they no longer believe in the systematisation of this profession in schools with Roma pupils. <p/> On Friday, in the atrium of the Goga bookstore in Novo mesto, a discussion evening with Roma assistants took place on the education of Roma and the importance of Roma assistants. The event was organised by the Roma Association Gypsies Once Upon a Time - Roma Today and took place as part of the European Youth in Action project. Bogdan Miklič, President of the Association Gypsies Once Upon a Time - Roma Today, said about the project, entitled ""Centre for Media Research and Roma Coexistence"", that it comprises a collage of events that will take place all over Slovenia, in addition to Novo mesto, in Ribnica, the Kočevje region and another municipality. ""The project will include various workshops. Romani children will try out the role of journalists in Romani settlements, write short articles, and prepare short radio diary entries. The participants are young Roma, aged between 15 and 30, who come mainly from the Novometi region,"" Miklič explained. He added that they will appear in institutions that deal with Roma issues in one way or another. ""We will also meet with high school students, we want to appear in police buildings, various schools, to create a bridge between Roma and non-Roma, to breathe together, to find a common language and perhaps to break through prejudices,"" he stressed. <p/> Miljana Mikica Gligič, a Roma helper with many years of experience, said that a Roma helper has a very wide range of possibilities and does not have to be limited to primary school. <p/> ""If we were invited, we could also work in a social work centre, a municipality, a kindergarten, the state administration or the police,"" Gligič said. <p/> Lili Majer from Kočevje says she enjoys her work, but in the beginning she overcame her fear. ""I didn't know how I would be received by the pupils, their parents and the staff at the primary school, but I have no regrets about taking this job,"" she says. <p/> Mitja Novak works as a Roma assistant at the Frana Metelka Škocjan Primary School. He has many years of experience. ""At the beginning you feel responsibility and you have no feeling how you will be received. It took me three months to get used to it. I already knew the Roma parents and the children, but what worried me most was the reaction of the parents of the other children,"" he recalls. <p/> On Friday, we talked to Roma helpers about their work and Roma education. The discussion evening took place as part of the youth initiative of the Roma Media and Coexistence Research Centre, within the framework of the European Youth in Action project. Let's listen to a part of the discussion with the participation of Roma assistants Miljana Mikica Gligič, Lilica Majer and Mitja Novak. <p/> Ms Gligičeva explained that when she started this job, the condition for a Roma assistant was that he or she had a high school education and was familiar with Roma history and the Romani language, otherwise he or she could jump into the role of a non-Roma with the relevant knowledge. Subsequent applicants had to complete a 4-year course in Roma history and culture, mathematics, Slovenian and English. ""They have been awarded National Vocational Qualification Certificates, but apparently this counts for nothing, as there is a younger generation of Roma assistants who are being posted to schools directly from the Employment Service, even though they have not received the relevant training. Their contract does not say that they will work on teaching assistance, but on socialisation and integration of Roma,"" Gligic does not see how to mobilise Roma assistants in a different way. <p/> Novak adds that a condition for becoming a Roma assistant should be a certificate of national vocational qualification. ""The Ministry of Education has made this a condition for us to be able to continue to do this work, but things remain unresolved, even though it is the sixth year since we completed the training for Roma assistants,"" Novak notes. <p/> Mitja Novak believes that the Ministry of Education can provide answers in this regard, while Lilica Majer believes that the management of the People's University of Kočevje, which is the managing partner of the project ""Successful Integration of Roma into Education II"", which is developing and implementing the activities of the Roma assistant, would know more about this. Ms Miljana Mikica Gligič suggested that additional information be provided by Dr Vera Klopčič from the Institute for Ethnic Issues, who was present at the discussion evening. She stressed the great importance of the trust created by the work of the Roma assistants and the need to strengthen the links between the various stakeholders in society involved in the education of Roma. The participants agreed that it would be a good idea to organise an extended discussion evening with the participation of representatives of the Ministry of Education and other organisations.",News/Reporting,train

The new monitoring site will give us a more sophisticated measurement network in MOM, better information on air quality in the city centre and the possibility to better identify the relationship between traffic and PM10 concentrations.

496,"For a person in pain, we think first about what caused the pain, and then about how to alleviate it. Pain is indicative of origin and cause, but rarely is it so characteristic that it suggests a definitive diagnosis in itself. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the accompanying information about how you feel, the surrounding circumstances and the findings on examination and further investigations. <p/> 1. <p/> When something hurts, something is wrong <p/> Pain is often indicative of its origin and cause by its site of occurrence, its characteristics and the accompanying changes in the affected body part. Thus, a sore throat may be accompanied by redness of the pharynx, a sore elbow by a painful movement in a certain direction, a painful pressure on a certain spot near the joint. Painful spasms under the right rib arch after a fatty meal... So, when we think of the above-mentioned pains, we will think of sore throat, of prolonged overstrain of the muscles of the forearm, of gallstones... For most pain patients, these are unpleasant sensations caused by the activation of pain receptors in the tissues. These receptors are found in the skin, mucous membranes, connective tissue, muscles, the popliteum and in the walls of internal organs (and in many places they are absent - for example, in the brain! Injury or damage to tissue releases so-called ""pain-inducing substances"" that act on pain receptors. This results in so-called nociceptive pain. This can be further divided into visceral (when the internal organs are affected - the pain will typically be in the form of painful 'spasms' - colic) and somatic (this is typically tearing and/or throbbing). When something hurts, something is wrong. Our everyday experience therefore equates pain with tissue damage or failure. When we miss a nail with a hammer and hit our thumb nail, the pain can be very severe, but we know the cause and are not frightened because we know that it is not serious and will pass quickly. When it hurts and the cause is not clear, fears arise. These can disturb our peace of mind much more than, for example, a ""chest prick"" for its own sake. That's why we want to explore pain. People choose to see a doctor more often and sooner because of pain (or other unpleasant body sensations) than because of a (painless) disturbance in a bodily function. Somehow they feel that if it doesn't hurt, it can't be worse. But if it hurts ... didn't the neighbour who was complaining of pain in his fingers have a heart attack? Didn't a colleague in the company have a sudden severe headache and bleeding in her head, but hasn't been back to work since? <p/> EXAMINE THE PAIN <p/> So, when there is pain, there is a need to see a doctor and there is a need to examine the pain. And how will the doctor proceed? In the case of a patient with pain, he or she first thinks about what caused the pain, and then about how to relieve it. Pain may give clues to its origin and cause - but it is rarely so characteristic that it suggests a definitive diagnosis in itself. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the accompanying information about how you feel, the surrounding circumstances and the findings on examination and further investigations. It then treats the cause of the pain, and if the pain is relieved while the treatment of the cause takes longer, it treats the pain itself. (As we say, it treats ""symptomatically"" - symptomatic treatment is that which relieves the symptom, in this case the pain - but it does not treat the cause). Since pain is a subjective experience, it is from the patient that the doctor will learn most about pain (as well as other sensory abnormalities). When the patient does not provide all the information himself, he will make further targeted enquiries, especially if he has already formed a ""working diagnosis"" (hypothesis) of what the patient's pain is ""supposed"" to mean. In order to be able to direct the examination and investigations on the basis of the pain and to arrive at a definitive diagnosis, the doctor will collect information on the site of the pain, the nature of the pain (including its duration), the circumstances of the pain, the factors that amplify the pain and the factors that mitigate it. Of course, he or she will also be interested in any other information that is usually collected when talking to the patient (so-called ""history taking""). When the pain is sufficiently characteristic or accompanied by data to guide examination and investigations, the method described above will suffice. The examination process will be fairly straightforward and will not take much time. However, even in such a patient, it is often useful to measure the pain further. In a very simple way, we can assess it in the patient's own words: even with a basic record, we will define the pain in terms of intensity as mild, moderate, severe, very severe. It is also useful to note how much inconvenience it causes the subject (how it interferes with daily activities, how it disturbs sleep). Additionally - and still simply - we measure it using the so-called visual analogue scale: the subject marks the spot corresponding to the intensity of his pain on a 10 cm long straight line, bordered on the left by 0 and on the right by 10 (meaning either a state of no pain at all - 0, or a state of the worst possible pain - 10). By then measuring the marked spot (for example on a 10 cm line), a numerical indication of pain is obtained (for example 5, 5). This information is recorded in the report and will later be used to measure more precise pain intensity than just ""moderate pain"". If the patient scores the pain as 3 at the follow-up examination, we will get the impression that the pain is milder, although the patient will still self-report it as 'moderate'. Of course, a similar analogue scale can also be used to measure other inconveniences that accompany pain (e.g. how much the pain interferes with his/her social activities). In cases of chronic pain, it is useful to spend more time analysing it and to give the patient a questionnaire to fill in (this can also be completed in the waiting room). For example, such a questionnaire has been developed by colleagues at the Slovenian Association for the Treatment of Pain (Slovenian version of the Brief Pain Inventory, developed by Cleeland). Although psychological and social aspects may be present to some extent in any pain, these are explored in greater depth in chronic pain, or when the cause of the pain is not clear or seems disproportionate to the cause. All pain is perceived by the nervous system or the brain. Nerve connections carry pain information from the affected area to the brain. However, pain can also be caused by a defect in the sensory nervous system, in which case we speak of neuropathic pain. (In this context, the term 'neuropathic' is used in the broadest sense and means a nervous system defect. This should be explained because the term neuropathy is used in medicine to refer specifically to an affection of the so-called peripheral nerves. Neuropathic pain', on the other hand, refers to all pain arising from nerve damage or dysfunction, whether peripheral or central nervous system. ) When neuropathic pain is suspected, we ask targeted, detailed questions about the various accompanying neurological symptoms (such as tingling, burning, hot, cold and other unusual sensations at or near the painful site), as well as about possible additional disturbances of various other nerve functions. In short, a patient with suspected neuropathic pain will be questioned and examined differently from a patient with ""normal"", i.e. nociceptive pain. <p/> CLINICAL EXAMINATION <p/> In the case of suspected nociceptive pain, we orientate ourselves to the affected part of the body and examine it closely (otherwise we perform a general and local physical examination, which - depending on the pain - is oriented ""internal"", ""surgical"", ""orthopaedic"", etc.). In the case of suspected neuropathic pain, we focus on the ""neurological"" examination. While this includes the examination of many neurological functions, the most important part of the examination in pain is the examination of skin and mucous membrane tenderness. This examination is seemingly simple, but it is actually one of the most challenging elements of the neurological examination, both for the examiner and for the subject. In the sensitivity examination, we first look for areas of the body that are insensitive to particular qualities of sensation (to fine touch, to pain, to cold, to warm, to vibration, to joint position). We then compare whether, in different anatomically defined areas of the body, the subject feels these qualities normally or in the same way as in the area he/she describes as normally sensitive. In short, in this second part of the investigation, we try to determine the extent of the decrease in sensitivity in a particular anatomical arrangement. The anatomical distribution of the sensitivity disturbance indicates the nervous structure affected, with a particular nerve animating a different area of skin and mucous membranes than a single nerve root; in spinal cord involvement, again, the distribution is different; and in brain involvement, it is also characteristically distributed. It is, in short, the ""failure pattern"" that tells us a lot about which nerve structure is affected. Since there are many different ""dropout patterns"", practically all of them cannot be tested without completely ""tiring"" the subject, so an experienced investigator needs to create a working diagnosis (or a short ""list"" of the most likely diagnoses) on the basis of the information he or she gets from talking to the patient, in order to be able to investigate in a targeted way. In addition to the anatomical distribution of the sensitivity loss, we are also interested in the severity of the lesion. The quantitative extent of the sensitivity change can, of course, only be roughly defined by clinical examination (mild, moderate or extensive loss). When we investigate sensitivity in a patient with neuropathic pain, we will often be alerted to the fact that a mild stimulus is already felt as distinctly unpleasant, painful (this is allodynia). This patient will often go on to say that he or she feels a mild pain stimulus (for example, a light prick with a pinprick) as distinctly painful, and the pain may persist when the stimulus is no longer there (this phenomenon is called hyperalgesia and hyperpathia). In patients with suspected neuropathic pain, we therefore specifically investigate whether allodynia and hyperalgesia are also present and, in addition to sensitivity to a static stimulus (pressure), we also investigate sensitivity to a moving stimulus (swiping with a cotton wool pad or brush). This sensitivity is not exclusively found in patients with neuropathic pain, but is less common in other pain conditions. The clinical examination of a patient with suspected neuropathic pain is quite extensive and demanding. This is why experts are trying to be more successful with a more targeted approach, which would be more manageable by a larger number of experts. French researchers have published a very promising short questionnaire (DN4) that can be used to discriminate well certain neuropathic pain syndromes. <p/> TECHNICAL TOOLS <p/> The sense of fine touch is orientation tested by a light touch with the finger, for a lighter touch a piece of cotton wool should be used. Good quantification of fine touch is possible with von Frey hair sticks (calibrated nylon filaments on a handle - ""monofilaments""). This method is particularly useful for studies where we want to have a completely standardised procedure. In Slovenia, hairpin testing has become established especially in the standardised screening of diabetics at risk of peripheral nerve involvement (diabetic polyneuropathy). For pain testing, we use a pumice stone (which is discarded after use! ) or a sharp broken wooden stick. The sensation of cold can be tested roughly by touching areas of skin with solid metal objects, or traditionally with a test tube filled with cold water. The sense of warmth is tested with a test tube filled with warm water. The sense of vibration is tested with a tuning fork. This sensation can be partially quantified with a special musical fork that has a scale to monitor the intensity of the vibration. When testing joint position sensation, we do not use any aids to assess the subject's sense of the position of a stationary joint and the subject's recognition of the direction of movement of the joint (as a rule, we mainly test the movement of the joints in the toes). Quantitative sensory testing has established itself as an important adjunct to the clinical examination, as it can provide quantitative and modality-specific information about the sensory impairment. Techniques are known to quantify mechanical sensation, thermal sensation and electrical stimulus detection. All of these methods are also used, at least in some places, for routine diagnostic purposes, but are, for the time being, of particular relevance to research work. The principle of these methods is to determine the threshold of sensitivity for a particular quality of sensation and, of course, the threshold of pain for a particular modality of sensation (pressure, hot, cold, etc.). Quantitative sensory testing is a ""psychophysical"" examination The tests require an alert, attentive and well-cooperative subject who understands the instructions well. We have already mentioned that touch sensitivity can be quantified by von Frey hair. These nylon filaments can also be used to determine the area of hypersensitivity (hyperalgesia) to point stimuli in a patient with neuropathic pain. Thicker filaments also irritate pain receptors in the skin and can be used to determine the threshold for mechanical pain. Quantified testing of hot and cold sensation is done with special thermodes that are placed on a specific part of the body and adjusted to develop a specific temperature. In patients with suspected neuropathic pain, we mainly use the method of determining the threshold of sensation. Patients with neuropathic pain often report paradoxical sensations (for example, feeling a very cold object as 'hot'). The sensation of vibration can be quantitatively assessed using vibrameters, i.e. an electromechanical device with a handpiece that has an adjustable amplitude of displacement, while applying standardised pressure to the skin. The vibrometer is used to determine the vibration detection threshold and the vibration decay threshold. In a subject with pain and suspected peripheral nerve impairment, electrophysiological methods can be used to define the impairment more precisely. The methods used are electromyography (measuring the electrical activity of muscles) and electroneurography (measuring the electrical responsiveness of nerves). A significant limitation of these methods is that they are only sensitive to abnormalities of the thicker and myelinated nerve fibres. Neuropathic pain arises particularly in the case of thin nerve fibre defects, which are not investigated by routine electrophysiological methods. In central nervous system disorders, other electrophysiological methods (measurement of sensory and motor evoked potentials) will only exceptionally contribute to a more accurate anatomical diagnosis. Therefore, in the diagnosis of central nervous system disorders, we prefer to use imaging methods, which are also useful in the diagnosis of peripheral nervous system disorders, depending on the suspected location of the lesions or lesions. At the level of pain experience, there are interactions between several nervous subsystems, as shown by studies using functional brain imaging methods. These can track changes in brain activity during the experience of pain. (PET and functional MRI methods are currently used in the investigation of pain for research purposes only. ) Especially in chronic pain syndromes, the investigation and evaluation of the psychological and social dimensions of chronic pain are necessary, but a detailed description is beyond the scope of this paper. As nociceptive pain is treated differently from neuropathic pain, pain needs to be diagnosed accordingly. In neuropathic pain, we can expect better treatment success if we can differentiate between the different pain syndromes, not only in terms of the cause, but also in terms of the nature of the disorder. It seems important to distinguish between disorders with provoked pain and those with spontaneous pain. Stimulus-evoked pain can be more accurately defined by more in-depth sensory testing (especially quantitative sensory testing). While such a more precise definition of pain does not yet have a very clear impact on treatment decisions, it is hoped that a more precise definition of patients into those with dynamic hyperalgesia, static hyperalgesia and allodynia, respectively, will adequately identify specific subgroups for which we will soon be able to select appropriately targeted drugs. For the time being, a comprehensive patient interview and physical examination are an adequate basis for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain syndromes and for the follow-up of the patient during treatment. However, the management of more complex chronic pain conditions in patients usually requires a team approach to both diagnosis and treatment.",Information/Explanation,train

515,"Turkey, an economically highly developed country of more than 71 million people, has a remarkable history and culture and many well-preserved historical sites that are carefully maintained and cared for. Two of the most popular tourist destinations are the historic and picturesque seaside towns, which quickly captivate people with their oriental imagery. <p/> Antalya, with its riviera of long beaches, is sun-drenched for ten months of the year and is Turkey's main tourist asset. In the background, the mighty Taurus (Taurus Bull) mountains shield it from the northerly winds and hide a wealth of underground caves. It was founded by the ancient Greeks and still has its own walled quarter, as do the Jews, Christians and, of course, Muslims. Affluent Antalya is the largest city in the Mediterranean, and its population has exploded in recent decades. As recently as 1985, there were 261 000 inhabitants; now there are more than 1 200 000, and with the metropolitan area there are a million more. In addition, it hosts over ten million tourists every year. <p/> I started my walk through the old town of Kaleiçi from a vast platform with water towers and a monument to Atatürk, the reformist statesman who wanted to bring Turkey closer to Europe. Among other things, he introduced the Latin alphabet and rejected religious extremes, including the headscarf. Today, children climb his monument freely, and the country has gone off the rails. <p/> The platform overlooks the city centre, with its three mosques and a lone medieval brick-red minaret - the Yivli. I joined the strollers on the city promenade, where ice-cream makers keep the mood up - doing mischief with dondurma ice-cream on long sticks. And there I was, standing in the square in front of the Saat Kulesi clock tower, a good city landmark, turning off to the bustling bazaar among oriental smells and colourful stalls. I then continued to Hadrian's Gate, where I entered the Ottoman world from the modern part of the city. The gate in the city walls is a triumphal arch of three entrances, built in 130 AD when the then Roman Emperor visited the city. <p/> In Antalya's Old Town you can admire the sophisticated Ottoman architecture of the houses, which are home to lovely souvenir shops, galleries, small hotels and restaurants with romantic gardens. Older locals like to sit on the benches and walls, snoozing or playing their board games. <p/> Antalya has no town beach, as it is built on high cliffs. It does, however, have a charming little harbour, which is dangerous for boats in the winter months. Resting on a bench in Karaalioglu Park, near the 1st century red tower of Hidirlik, which still clings to the remains of the thick city walls, I noticed that old and young, Turkish and foreign, gather around here. I had a beautiful view of the harbour and Antalya on the cliffs. This park also ends at the sea with a steep cliff into which steps have been cut leading to small rocky platforms. <p/> The surroundings of Antalya offer plenty of opportunities for excursions as well as challenging sporting adventures. In the resort of Belek, there is a golf course stretching along the sea, along which we drove for more than half an hour, and there are areas for divers too. Not far away are historic towns such as Side, Myra, Alanya and others, where you can take public transport for a pittance. A visit to the park where the Manavgat River flows into the sea is unforgettable. Its refreshing waterfalls roar and spray droplets of water far out to sea, where they magically end in an arc of colourful rainbows. <p/> It's a story unto itself, the long Turkish Riviera, where one beach is as long as the Slovenian coast, with megalomaniacal hotel resorts, buildings like Harry Potter movies or replicas of Venice's St Mark's Square... <p/> Attractive Alanya <p/> Alanya is the oldest tourist town on the Turkish Riviera. It lies on the southern coast of Anatolia (Asia Minor) and is said to have been discovered by Cleopatra VII, the last Egyptian Pharaoh. She loved to visit here with her husband Marc Antony and their three children. One of the town's three beaches is still named after her - Cleopatra's Beach. Here, fine sand fills the turquoise sea. The pebbly beach flows east into the peninsula that divides Alanya in two. The peninsula rises steeply to a rocky hill, green at the top and hiding the remains of a once mighty fortress. You can also take a gondola almost to the top. Within the castle walls, you will find the Byzantine church, the Suleiman Mosque and the caravanserai built by Suleiman the Magnificent. The castle, which was beautifully restored just over a decade ago, was built in 1226 by the Seljuk Sultans as their winter residence, but the hill was already inhabited during the Hittite Empire more than three thousand years ago. <p/> In the Middle Ages, under Sultan Aladdin Kejkubad I, the city enjoyed a golden age. In addition to the castle, several important buildings remain from those times, such as the Kizil Kule - the Red Watchtower, which stands in the harbour below the castle and is an outstanding example of medieval military architecture, and the Tersane shipyard. <p/> On the other side of the peninsula is the town's harbour, once a favourite haunt of the notorious Mediterranean pirates. In the town, you can see the former Atatürk Villa, a fine example of Ottoman architecture. We also visited the fascinating Müze Museum, which illustrates the many civilisations of Anatolia. In the museum park, peacocks roam and strut among the remains of Roman statues and Islamic tombstones. The city thrives on tourism, and not far away is the famous Damlatas underground cave, which is said to be beneficial for asthmatics. <p/> Rich country, poor people <p/> Turkey has lush vegetation and fertile soil so that they can grow all their own food, much of it exported to the wider world. In Antalya, the masses of white-tiled greenhouses that stretch beyond the city to the foot of Taurus are visible from the plane, and there are no shortage of them among the hotel resorts. <p/> It is well known that the east of the country is poorer than the west, where there are a good number of millionaires and even 37 billionaires. However, the general impression is that, although the country is rich, they have quite a few poor people. But they have a great joie de vivre, because there are many children and young people, and everybody respects the elderly and likes to socialise with each other in large numbers. <p/> In the parks, you don't see walkers, cyclists, passionate joggers like in our country, not even people with dogs. Man's best friends live there in freedom. They are all chipped, probably neutered, and a little bit shorthaired, and they roam around happily. Incidentally, the Turks breed the Anatolian Shepherd Dog, a brave herding dog used in some African countries to guard livestock against wild beasts. <p/> The Turkish language is difficult, but thanks to the many TV series, some of the words are familiar. The first records of Old Turkic were found on Sumerian tablets, and analyses of these cuneiform tablets have shown that the language is one of the oldest recorded languages. What's more, Turks understand and still use 1200 of these ancient words. Some Slovenian words originate from Turkish, such as pavilion, kiosk, hut, yurt, tent, divan, sofa, sofa, canteen, bag, cap, pocket, top, fool, kayak, etc., and words referring to gastronomy (cevapčičič, baklava, kebab, ajvar, yoghurt, coffee, sour cherries, corn) or to horse equipment (bridle, hamat). Last but not least, we have some Turkish surnames such as Tur(e)k, Intihar, Hodalič, Jančar, Kordiž, Mankoč, Oman, Šalamun and others. There are also a few place names that remind us of Turkish times, such as Tabor, Grmada, Hudo, and even Ljubljana's Bežigrad was named after a Turkish refugee who camped there before the siege of Ljubljana.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

The economic situation shall be deemed to have deteriorated significantly if the registered unemployment rate in the area of the administrative unit has been 17,0 % or higher for at least two consecutive months. The regional development agency must identify the area in need of special assistance and submit a time- and cost-estimated programme of additional development tasks in that area, specifying the objectives, the task promoters, the expected results and the indicators. Funds may be granted for a maximum period of two years. If, at the end of the programme of additional development tasks, the conditions for funding additional development tasks in the region are still met, a new programme may be drawn up. The eligible costs are staff costs and the costs of preparing the programme and projects related to addressing the identified development problems in the area in need of development assistance. Eligible costs are financed at 100 %. The previous paragraph applies mutatis mutandis to the procedure for allocating funds to finance additional development tasks in the region which are in the public interest. A development region receiving development aid under a special law shall not be eligible for additional funding under this paragraph. <p/> (4) The funds granted may be disbursed on the basis of reports submitted on the activities carried out. <p/> (1) In accordance with Article 35 of the Act on the Promotion of Coherent Regional Development, assistance to municipalities for the municipal improvement of Roma settlements shall be granted as special regional incentives in priority areas facing major structural problems. <p/> (2) The following municipalities shall be eligible for the assistance referred to in the preceding paragraph: <p/> - in which a representative of the Roma community is elected to the municipal council in accordance with the law governing local self-government, or <p/> - in which a special working body of the municipal council for monitoring the situation of the Roma community is set up in accordance with the provisions of the law governing the situation of the Roma community, the members of which are also representatives of the Roma community. <p/> (3) The Service shall carry out a public call for tenders or invite eligible municipalities to submit projects within the indicative quota referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article. In the call for tenders or invitation to tender, the Service shall specify the documentation to be submitted for the grant of assistance and the time limit for submission. If the call for proposals procedure is used, the Service may set the municipality a deadline for completing the project proposal. The Service shall prepare a programme proposal which shall be adopted by the Government. <p/> (4) The indicative quotas for the eligible municipalities shall be calculated on the basis of the available amount of funds in the budget item of the Service, the total number of eligible municipalities, an assessment of the equipment of Roma settlements with water supply, electricity, sewerage and transport infrastructure, the number of registered voters of the Roma community in the municipality and the funds allocated to the municipality on the basis of Articles 21 to 23 of the Act on the Financing of Municipalities (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No. 123/09, 101/07 - Decree of the European Parliament No. 101/07, and Article 57/08). <p/> (5) Aid may be granted to co-finance the following projects in Roma settlements: <p/> - water supply systems, including intakes and pipelines to the user's connection, <p/> - sewerage networks, where these are necessary to protect water resources or for other ecological requirements, <p/> - electrification of agglomerations, <p/> - new or reconstructed local roads and paths, <p/> - purchase of land for the improvement and completion of settlements. <p/> (6) In the case of land purchase, a ceiling for co-financing per square metre of land purchased shall be set in the invitation to tender or call for tenders, irrespective of the contract price. <p/> (7) Contracts for the allocation of funds may be multiannual, taking into account the contractual commitments already entered into in previous years when determining the annual quota available. <p/> (8) Projects shall be co-financed up to 100 %. <p/> Article 12 <p/> (Financing of programme implementation costs under special laws) <p/> Notwithstanding the co-financing of development tasks at regional level which are in the public interest in accordance with Article 10 of this Regulation, the total costs of the preparation and implementation of a special programme by a regional development agency shall be financed under a special contract, but these costs may represent no more than three per cent of the value of the special programme. <p/> Article 13 <p/> (Emergency regional policy measures) <p/> (1) A regional incentive may be granted to self-governing local authorities and individuals as an emergency regional policy measure in specific unforeseeable circumstances arising from a natural, ecological or other disaster. <p/> (2) Urgent regional policy measures referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be implemented in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14 of the Regulation on the granting of regional State aid (Official Journal of the RS, No 72/06, 70/07, 99/08 and 17/09). <p/> III.

In two years I have gained many regular clients, mostly younger entrepreneurs and companies who wanted to invest in their key staff.

I started with group trainings - lectures, motivational and team spirit workshops. In 2011, I added intensive motivational workshops in small groups of 3-5 people, which are very suitable for key personnel and highly motivated individuals. I started to expand my knowledge with the topics of restoring inner strength and increasing performance. Later I expanded the training topics to: developing potential, managing stressful situations, managing emotions in working with people, rational energy and time management, improving interpersonal relations at work, modern communication skills, increasing productivity, creativity and performance at work, leading from the inside out, developing intrinsic motivation and others. As I am continuously learning and improving myself, in line with the new knowledge I am acquiring, as well as the identified needs of my largely regular clients, I am constantly expanding my areas of training. In 2011, I also actively focused on Human Resources Development and individual training. I am moving the personalised approach to training, which for many years was reserved only for senior managers, to all levels, with the aim of maintaining and developing healthy, happy, effective and successful individuals who can bring the most of their strengths and potentials to the business environment. I combine individual training programmes with Inner Strength - Energy Revitalisation programmes in a very innovative and effective way. All trainings are designed to encourage, motivate and raise awareness of employees to continuously develop their key qualities and potentials. I try to ensure that my trainings are also a blend of practical knowledge combined with a lot of motivating energy for the participants and my efforts are confirmed by many satisfied clients.

547,"That the Minister of the Environment and Spatial Planning, Andrej Vizjak, decided to deny our publication on Saturday morning via the twitter profile of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning of the information circulating about his (possible) resignation due to the fiasco of the water referendum ... <p/> ... but not himself, personally, as Minister Vizjak, since his possible departure from the ministerial office is not a matter of a decision of the ministry, but of the Prime Minister and the SDS party, suggests at least two things: <p/> - The minister's (admittedly justified) nervousness ... <p/> - ... and the fact that the quiet behind-the-scenes battle (for) Minister Vizjak is far from over. <p/> Meanwhile, it is worth noting the following: within the SDS party, it is increasingly being realised that Vizjak is no longer the minister from the second Janša government and that Vizjak is now even being meaningfully defended by individual members of Odlazko's political media on the grounds that Vizjak is ""Too Big to Fail"", which is not unexpected either. It is a logical consequence of the fact that Odlazek's media was taken into ownership some time ago <p/> When the political scene smelled a bit of Tanja Fajon - as a possible prime minister (here), Sebastjan Selan, former director of the SOVA during Pahor's government, has already appeared, then director of Petan's flagship companies, the now-sold Marina Portorož and the not-yet-sold Terme Čatež, also allegedly involved in the secret filming of Minister Zdravko Počivalšek during the mask affair (source), when Selan himself made a quick buck selling protective medical equipment during the first wave of the epidemic of Covida-19. Selan has long been considered a silent and publicly unacknowledged advisor to Fajon and, according to our sources within the SD, has already started recruiting (read: promising posts and positions ""when we come to power""), and in doing so, of course - quite expectedly for those who are more familiar with the situation in the party - he has bumped into the SD Secretary General Dejan Levanič and another behind-the-scenes SD recruiter, former SD Director General Uroš Jauševec. <p/> Today and tomorrow, including the days after Sunday's water referendum, are indeed thunder days for the Janez Janša government. After the referendum fiasco and the opposition's threats of a new constructive no-confidence motion, three extremely important votes of the National Assembly are scheduled today and tomorrow, when the government will need at least 45 and even 46 votes: <p/> - Today's vote on the demographic fund <p/> - And (tomorrow's) re-vote on the amendment to the law on infectious diseases, and the vote on the election of a new Minister for Digitalisation - Marko Boris Andrijanič (NSi). <p/> Because if all these votes fall, the Janša government will be seriously shaken, maybe even fall (well, the government representatives assure internally that they have the votes of the MPs guaranteed), which would most probably be followed by early elections.

563,"The second man to climb all eight thousanders <p/> GL3 Post ID: 91944 <p/> Post ID: 39741 <p/> Diary of Jerzy Kukuczkà, a Pole <p/> WARSAW - The world's public has hardly known that another man has achieved a feat that only the famous South Tyrolean mountaineer Reinhold Messner has ever been able to match. Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland managed to do in ""just"" nine years what Messner took a total of 17 years to do: climb all fourteen of the world's eight-thousanders. <p/> Polish mountaineer Jerzy Kukuczka Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland is a true high-altitude mountaineer. He is a man who has left the beaten track, taken his own path, almost played with the eight-thousanders, and in the process opened up some new perspectives for mountaineering at such altitudes. ""On 18 September 1987, Jerzy Kukuczka was on the summit of the 8046-metre-high Shisha Pangma and confirmed Messner's ambition of ""one man on all eight thousand metres"" as the second man. Like Messner, Kukuczka, a trained electrical engineer, was trying to blaze new trails: not the usual expedition routes, but much more challenging routes, some of them even in winter! Do the two super-climbers - Messner completed his round of fourteen eight-thousanders just one year before his rival - see each other as rivals? ""I can understand the race for the most climbs, but not the race for the most eight-thousanders"", the South Tyrolean commented. Was that really an honest word? In any case, the Pole also stresses that he had no rival in sight in pursuit of his great mountaineering goal. He even seems to have unlimited respect for Messner's success: ""This man deserves all our respect; he was the first to climb all the eight-thousanders - some of them more than once"". Sympathetic words. Kukuczek started with Lotse (8516 metres) in 1979, followed by Mount Everest (8848 metres). In October 1981, he himself climbed Makalu (8463 metres). A year later, he climbed Broad Peak, and in the summer of 1983 he climbed Gasherbrum II and I. In 1985, he succeeded in Daulagiri (8167 metres) and Cho Oyu (8201 metres). Kukuczka's ninth eight-thousander was Nanga Parbat (8125 metres). ""Stations"" 10,11, and 12 were - all in 1986 - Kangchendzenga (8586 metres), K 2 (8611 metres) and Manaslu (8163 metres). Anapurna (8091 metres) was the next in February 1987. Lastly, as already mentioned, Shisha Pangma in September 1987. On the summit of this mountain, a Pole bivouacked, brought his skis and descended to base camp the next morning! Jerzy Kukuczka lives with his family - his wife and two young sons - in Katowice. He is considered to be rather shy, he does not want to be in the limelight, he does not like television cameras. He has made a reputation not only for his own climbs, but also as a leader of mountaineering expeditions. He has always tried to get as many climbers as possible to the highest peak. On Shisha Pangama, he was accompanied by Wanda Rutkiewicz, his compatriot, who is considered the most successful climber of the highest mountains.",News/Reporting,train

569,"Today, thinking or the free public use of the mind is once again becoming a matter of survival. Delirium is at the core of the political mainstream. This is also reflected in the sentence uttered by the Finance Minister-designate at Monday's hearing: ""We find ourselves in an extremely challenging situation where, logically, we should be doing something, but we are forced to do the opposite."" Mramor's sentence thus suggests that the incoming government will take decisions that will go against logic, i.e. common sense, and therefore against what would be best for the majority of people. <p/> So the government will continue to follow the delirious path that is deepening the crisis, imposing policies as solutions that have long since been proven to be counterproductive and harmful. Therefore, as long as we allow those who have received their mandate from the people, in their self-confidence and harmful optimism, to continue to take decisions unhindered, not by following the logic of things, but by following its opposite (where the guiding principle becomes the service of this or that private interest to the detriment of the community), a way out of the crisis is neither probable nor possible. <p/> Today's problem is not at all a lack of optimism or even pessimism, as one might think if one were to accept uncritically the statements that people in the highest positions make in the public arena. What is much more problematic at this time is a particular kind of optimism, which is most often expressed by the very representatives of the political and economic elites. <p/> We could get an impression of such optimism listening to the outgoing Prime Minister in an interview on the national television channel. In particular, she praised the past achievements of her government, and then went on to talk, with a kind of barbecue, about how she is convinced that, in the end, we will find a solution to the problem that will arise when the route of the pipeline is decided again, where the interests of Russia and the EU are in conflict (and she herself will have to do a somersault in her future role as Commissioner, representing exactly the opposite position on this issue to the one she held as Prime Minister when she met the Russian gas tycoon), which will definitely make the future bright. <p/> Her completely uncritical rant, which was also without a hint of feeling for the difficult situation in which many families and individuals in this country find themselves, having to deal with questions about how to get through the month on a daily basis, is not an isolated case, though. Optimism has become quite commonplace in the speeches of politicians, although it is difficult to show that it actually accompanies action to improve the quality of life of citizens - it often appears precisely in the absence of any substance, or when someone in a position of responsibility is rightly expected to make a constructive proposal or take a very concrete step (because that is what they are elected to do), and yet, by waxing lyrical, they are hiding the fact that they have no idea of how to tackle the most acute problems. <p/> One of the most optimistic politicians here is certainly the President of the country himself. In a recent speech, he said this: ""If we are smart, brave and composed enough, we can now finally turn things around. Over time, people's living standards will rise again, our confidence in the country's legal and political institutions will be strengthened and an encouraging, optimistic mood will return."" What exactly is the basis for such optimism? What - apart from fine words - is there here to inspire credibility? What political solutions to one of the most serious problems, such as the growing poverty among the population and the immense enrichment of a minority, are promised in the actions of the incoming government? What reason for optimism should we have in view of the fact that the unemployment rate has not changed significantly and that there is no prospect of any beneficial changes any time soon (and with the statements of the future Finance Minister, there are perhaps even fewer reasons for such optimism)? <p/> On the side of those in power today, the trend is one of optimism and overconfidence, which could more accurately be described as pathological narcissism, where the rest of us are reduced in their eyes to a passive audience that is merely there to validate their inflated egos (the various fights for the post of Commissioner and the self-aggrandisement of who is better suited for it are a sign of this very phenomenon). <p/> It may seem to some that, since we still do not have a prescription for how to build a democratic society, it is best to leave things to those who have already ""screwed up"" many things in the past (just think how many members of parliament and even of the incoming government have formed past ""fallen"" governments, and have now been given a mandate again for the next few years), since they are at least old acquaintances on the political scene (and should therefore know how to go about the management of common affairs). <p/> Some change of mind is needed. Derrida's idea of democracy implies that democracy is a process that is also a learning process: democracy is the happening, the practising or learning of democracy. So the (democratic) communion has yet to be invented or inventing. An honest attitude is therefore not the flimsy optimism of a Pahor or Bratušek, but anything but. It requires a lot of thinking, intellectual work and experimentation, trying out the ways in which people organise their daily lives in community. And that means that it will only be possible when people try to live it, to put it into practice, to practise it, and therefore when they come to the debate without asking the authorities for permission. Democracy cannot be taught to the people, nor is it necessary. But a certain amount of self-reliance is certainly in order. It is probably true that any political engagement requires a great deal of thought, study and insight into many complex issues, but that does not mean that one should remain silent until someone gives the floor and allows one to speak up. Democracy cannot be some once-and-for-all status quo brought to the people by a good man like Santa Claus. This is why Derrida stressed that democracy is always its own promise, something that is always yet to come (if people work for it, of course). <p/>The biggest obstacle to democratisation and engagement is not ignorance at all, because Socrates already knew that it is in fact the privileged place of the production of all possible knowledge. The greatest obstacle to both the spiritual or mental progress of the individual and the progress of the community towards the common good is the arrogance that is everywhere today in the words of the most influential politicians and other members of the elite. Listening to politicians of the highest rank, from the President of the European Commission to prime ministers and economists of the international financial institutions, one gets the impression that they all know the solutions, we just have to let them implement them. (And then, when these people are actually given a free hand, more often than not, the opposite happens: problems are potentiated, because their ""solutions"" become the real problems - just remember t. (This is because such arrogance is akin to stupidity, which invariably has very concrete (and most often disastrous) effects on the people who are forced to live under its rule. This is also why it is necessary to shake off the prejudice that the ruling class always knows what it is doing. (All we can do, then, is to leave it alone in its self-delusion and join in the optimism it calls us to). This prejudice is also supported by the view that, in the circumstances, it is best to keep to oneself and mind one's own business, which then leaves the people on the political periphery as a more or less helpless bystander. <p/> The process of democracy therefore necessarily coincides with resistance to whatever makes it impossible (today, this is especially capitalism and its sadistic imperative to increase and centralise profits). Resistance is therefore logical, rational, in the name of logic. But without a critical attitude and a systematic use of doubt (especially when we are confronted with the statements and actions of agents of power), we cannot speak of democracy at all. <p/> Much more than simulated optimism, what we need is resistance in the name of logic, i.e. of mental action: this coincides here with an unshakable trust in the power of intelligence, i.e. in man's creative capacity and power to produce new ideas (such a trust has been contemplated by Enlightenment philosophers from Socrates and Plato to Spinoza and Descartes and Kant and Derrida...), which will, as an important part of the process of democracy, determine the shape of the world to come.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
570,"Description. We presented the public goods game, its rules, strategies and possible payoffs. We have presented the three main elementary strategies for playing the public goods game. These are co-operation, co-operation with reward and co-operation with punishment. In order to make the results comparable throughout the paper, we have tried to choose parameters where we can compare the results directly or at least within some reasonable similarity. The presentations of the elementary strategies showed that they contribute to fostering the development of cooperation and that punishment is the most successful of the presented ones, because it fosters cooperation even at lower synergy factors. The presentation of the elementary strategies is followed by a test of whether there are any evolutionary advantages in combining correlated positive and negative reciprocity into a single strategy. Similarly to the presentation of the elementary strategies, we have also looked at the strategy of simultaneous reward and punishment and obtained results showing that, independently of the synergy factor at which the simulations were run, the combined strategy of punishment and reward did not show evolutionary advantages over the elementary strategies of reward and, in particular, punishment. While narrow bands have been shown for very unrealistic parameters where the combined strategy can show its strength, it also appears that punishment alone would be superior for the same parameters.

Immediately afterwards, you could listen to a conversation with Gabrijela Žagar Fereira about the meeting of Slovenians in Stuttgart, which they managed to organise with the help of social networks. <p/> The 54th Slovenian Language, Literature and Culture Seminar concluded today in Ljubljana, bringing together around a hundred participants from all over the world who share a common desire to acquire knowledge in all three areas (language, literature and culture), but the two-week seminar is also a great opportunity for participants to get a close-up taste of life and events in Slovenia. Mojca Delač took to the radio microphone at the Faculty of Arts, which hosted the seminar. <p/> Gabrijela Žagar Fereira founded the Slovenians in Germany group so that she could share her experience with all those who have moved to Germany or have already made it their home. The group has grown rapidly and today has more than 7000 members. They have managed to solve many problems, and now, with the help of this group, they have come together to organise a meeting in a park in Stuttgart, says Gabrijela. A good number of Slovenians from the younger generation attended, which would have been very difficult to do without the help of social networks. <p/> Last week, Dora Žebot, a refugee and long-time journalist for the Slovenian section of the BBC, a London-born Slovenian who was born in Maribor, said goodbye at the age of 96. She was the daughter of the pre-war Deputy Mayor of Maribor, the conscious Slovene Franjo Žebot. Dora Žebot and her husband were among those Slovenian emigrants in London who did much to raise the profile of Slovenia. Her daughter, Alenka Lawrence, also a journalist, likes to tell how she joined her parents at the demonstrations with the banners ""Free Slovenia! Dora Žebot has followed Slovenian and world political events all her life. Many well-known Slovenians, writers, politicians and journalists have always visited her. <p/> Researcher Andreja Bezjak is asking for participation in the project ""Documenting Slovenian folklore among Slovenian emigrants in North America"". From 7 to 28 September 2018, she will continue her project of collecting Slovenian folklore, memories and life narratives of Slovenian emigrants in the USA and Canada. She is still looking for contacts in Toronto, Montreal, Pennsylvania and New York.

604,"Digital Marketing Essentials and Activities <p/> Today, it's harder than ever to stand out from all the competition. But you've never had as much chance of success as you do today. With all the options available, choosing services and tactics is an even more complex task. Strategically planned, results-oriented activities, a smart digital strategy with the optimal combination and design of solutions, tactics and campaigns, will deliver surprising results, especially for companies that are just starting to approach digital marketing professionally, strategically, comprehensively and purposefully, with thoughtful and modern results-oriented approaches. <p/> Due to the many myths, inaccurate or misleading claims, innovations on the one hand, and the real opportunities in digital marketing on the other, companies, individuals and even ""experts"" are still too often making superficial choices about where to focus their energy and resources. Providers often offer what they know how to do, rather than what customers actually need. That's why in the following lines we take a closer look at the basic activities of digital marketing, and the details that set effective digital strategies apart from the crowd of mediocre ones. <p/> 1. An engaging and responsive mobile-friendly website <p/> Your website has long since ceased to be just a business card. It's your central online presence and your company's first salesperson. No one employee can do it. That's why you need a bespoke website that generates new business and customers under any circumstances. In today's digital reality, more and more of us are accessing and interacting with brands via smartphones and tablets, so it's vital that visitors are able to view your website and content in a unified, personalised way across all devices. The user experience on the site must be just as efficient, equally and quickly transparent, and everything must be in its place, whether the content is accessed on a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer. Those of you who are still neglecting mobile technology, flexible display methods and customers in the moments when they have their phone in their hand may long regret it, because you are neglecting them in those intimate moments when the deepest connection with your followers, potential customers and readers can be made. <p/> 2. Website optimisation and search marketing for lead generation <p/> Anyone who thinks that SEO no longer exists, or no longer delivers the right results, has a bad sense of humour. Search engine optimisation is alive and well, now more than ever, as long as it is adapted to new SEO methods. It is, however, much more difficult to implement than in the past, thanks to Google's sophisticated, sometimes annoying, search algorithm, which is being refined on a daily basis. Together with on-page optimisation, online advertising on search engines (e.g. Google AdWords) allows us to attract more new customers more easily and more quickly. All digital marketing activities must also be continuously monitored using web analytics tools, data collated, analysed and your website optimisation strategy continuously updated. <p/> 3. Email marketing <p/> It is amazing how many people still turn a blind eye to the usefulness and effectiveness of email marketing. Even though we are already in 2017, sending emails to your target audience has always been one of the more effective tactics to increase traffic and conversions on your website. We also call email marketing the ""evergreen of digital marketing"". In addition to its direct impact on sales, email marketing plays an even more important role in building and nurturing a loyal follower base that is ""fed"" with content, which in turn increases repeat purchases and subsequent conversions. <p/> Just think how many emails you receive in your inbox every day. But do you think there would really be that much if it didn't work? <p/> Of course, our goal and yours is not to fill inboxes all the time, but sending targeted messages to a segmented population (who have given permission) works wonders. The need to automate all these processes also makes it necessary to use tools and integrate email marketing and other databases, tools. For all of you who have not yet integrated email marketing into your business, you have now learned where you have been making a basic mistake all this time. <p/> 4. Using social networks <p/> Today, people find it difficult to trust and are overwhelmed with information, questions, obligations; but we are demanding and informed customers who make decisions and buy emotionally. We strive to have and achieve everything at the click of a button or a click. The reality is not so simple. Our decision-making is also influenced by our relationships with people, brand representatives, their support service, the information given and other subliminal brand messages. <p/> Social networks are a place where we can manage all of this and delight our followers with expected or unexpected attention, replies, interesting content, rewards to reinforce our brand and showcase our values. If we implement all of the above effectively up to this point, our social media activities will only further expand and strengthen our visibility and recognition. <p/> 5. Content marketing as a link <p/> The link between a smart and successful digital marketing strategy is the content strategy and the publishing calendar. Thus, content marketing, blog articles, images, infographics, e-books, videos, reports, etc., represent an increasing share of digital marketing investment. How could they not, when digital content has become the most important means of communication today. There are more and more reasons to plan, organise and produce content that wins the hearts of readers according to a specific publishing calendar. The measure of good content is not the beauty of the copy, but the value of the content that engages and leaves you wanting more. This builds authority and reinforces reader loyalty to the brand. Diverse content is becoming the flagship of digital messaging, giving colour and tone to communication and the selection of new customers. The importance of content is even greater when it comes to B2B marketing and sales. <p/> If you want to succeed and offer your customers something more than the rest, content strategy and segmented communication is one of the key success factors, so think very carefully about how you organise this area.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

611,"Front page / Current / Columns / Column: If fish could talk <p/> 08.02.2021 <p/> COLUMN DZZŽ NOVO MESTO <p/> Last month I discussed children's desire for an animal friend and how sometimes parents recklessly choose an animal to please their child. In the meantime, I also touched on goldfish in passing, which reminded me that fish actually deserve a column of their own. They are animals that are often misunderstood, inadequately treated and poorly cared for. <p/> Although most people think otherwise, fish also feel pain and fear. In fact, they are quite complex creatures that experience the world in much the same way as we do. This means that we need to arrange their environment in a way that keeps them relaxed and healthy. But what kind of environment is suitable for fish? <p/> This question creates an ""Emmental effect"" - more cheese, more holes, i.e. it offers more new questions than answers. Aquaristics is a rather complex and very large field and it is impossible to answer such a question in a few short sentences. Therefore, this article is by no means an aquarist's handbook, but only a cursory attempt to encourage you to take a responsible approach to aquaristics. <p/> It is actually a matter of imitating as closely as possible the environment in which a particular species of fish is found in the wild. So, before setting up a new aquarium, we need to consider the needs of a particular organism or choose a species that we can make comfortable in our aquarium. So what are the characteristics of a 'good' aquarium? <p/> First and foremost, the aquarium must be the right shape and size. Here I can mention goldfish, which are a textbook example of aquatic organisms that are most often found in a totally inappropriate environment. The goldfish, Carassius auratus auratus, originates from China, grows as large as 30-40 cm, and is a schooling fish, which means that we need to stock at least 5-10 specimens in total. It logically follows that these fish are only suitable for large, outdoor ponds and that there are not many that can be suitably housed in an aquarium in an apartment. I should add that they have a very long life span, living for several decades, and they are also very intelligent and can be taught tricks. If they could talk, what would all those poor little goldfish crammed into too small containers have to say? Of course, it is understandable that we do not have unlimited space for huge aquariums at home, and there is nothing wrong with that. In this case, however, we simply have to choose a species of fish that is comfortable in a smaller aquarium. <p/> Water properties are also very important. Water can be hard or soft, basic or acidic. Hard water is water in which a lot of minerals are dissolved. Tap water in Slovenia is often quite hard (have you noticed how quickly limescale builds up in the bathroom?), but a large proportion of ornamental aquarium fish are soft-water fish - in nature they live in waters with few dissolved minerals. If a fish is living in water that is not of a suitable quality (for example, a soft-water fish living in hard water, or water that is not of a good quality due to insufficient filtration), this is stressful for the fish. Prolonged presence of stress hormones leads to failure of internal organs and metabolism. One example of a fish that most people are familiar with, at least in appearance, and which is often stocked in unsuitable aquariums is the Siamese fighting fish, the betta. This type of fish needs very soft, slightly acidic water and lots of the right plants, so water from our taps is not usually suitable for them. Before we introduce organisms, we need to check the parameters of our water and adapt it to the needs of our aquatic sub-tenants, or rather, choose ones that can live in the water we have. <p/> Another very important thing for any healthy aquarium is a biologically stable filter. Filtration in an aquarium is not as simple as most people imagine. It is not just a matter of dirt particles getting stuck in the filter material and then being washed off. Filtration must also, and above all, be biological, which means that the filter and other surfaces in the aquarium are inhabited by beneficial bacteria that break down food debris, fish poo and plant debris, thus improving water quality. This filtration does not happen overnight, of course, and the bacteria need time to multiply sufficiently. From the first day we start the aquarium, it will be at least two weeks or more before it is stable enough for fish to settle in. Changes in the water parameters should be monitored regularly (with tests for nitrite, nitrate, ammonia). The values will first rise and then fall back - at that point the aquarium is established, or as aquarists put it - sciklan. <p/> In addition to the above, the choice of decoration, plants and combinations of organisms that can coexist together is also important. Of course, plastics are largely avoided in favour of natural materials (wood, stone), but which ones and how much depends on the individual fish species. The right plants are also an important part of a healthy aquarium and it is generally recommended to keep the aquarium as overgrown as possible (except, of course, when you have fish that also live in a plant-free environment in the wild). Often, aquariums are decorated with boats, treasure chests, castles and similar kitsch, which, of course, have nothing to do with the fish and their natural environment. <p/> Like all other animals, we have a duty to look after fish and other aquatic organisms in a way that makes them feel good. This is not only a moral but also a legal duty for all animal owners. Unfortunately, our wishes and aesthetics are last on the list of priorities when it comes to aquarium design. If we cannot accept this fact, then we can consider another hobby. Let's ask ourselves what the fish would tell us if they could talk. <p/> Anyone interested in learning more about aquaristics, aquatic organisms, choosing and setting up an aquarium can find a lot of useful information online, for example on the Alfa in betta blog, and in various Facebook groups, such as Aquarstika Slovenia - Bojan Dolenc.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

614,"international protection - restriction of movement of an applicant for international protection - removal procedure - abuse of procedure - objective criteria - implementation of the Directive <p/> Core <p/> The presumption that an applicant has made an application solely to delay his/her return can be justified on the basis of objective criteria. However, the current ZMZ-1 does not contain such objective criteria, which means that Article 8 of Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on standards for the reception of applicants for international protection has not been fully implemented in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia and, therefore, Article 8 of the Directive is directly applicable in accordance with the principle of primacy. Therefore, since the objective criteria have not been incorporated by the legislator into the ZMZ-1, it is not possible to restrict movement on this legal basis until the ZMZ-1 is amended accordingly. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> I. The action is allowed and the contested decision No 2142-906/2020-6 (1312-02) of 4 June 2020 is annulled. <p/> II. The application for interim measures is dismissed. <By the contested order, the defendant detained the applicant on the ground that his movements were already restricted as a result of the return procedure under the Law on the entry, stay and departure of aliens in the Republic of Slovenia, in order to carry out and enforce the removal procedure, and that it could reasonably be assumed that the applicant had lodged the application only to delay or obstruct the implementation of the removal procedure, when he had the possibility to apply for international protection. It decided that the applicant would be detained at the premises of the Aliens Centre in Postojna from 4 June 2020 from 15.20 until the end of the reason, but no longer than until 4 September 2020 at 15.20, with the possibility of an extension of one month. <p/> 2. In the grounds for the decision, the defendant states that the applicant lodged an application for international protection in the Republic of Slovenia on 4 June 2020. On 2 June 2020, the applicant was released from prison. .... The District Court ... imposed on him, inter alia, the ancillary sanction of expulsion of the alien from the country. As it was not possible to remove the applicant immediately from Slovenia, he was placed by decision of 2 June 2020 in the Aliens Centre, where he expressed his wish to apply for international protection on 3 June 2020, and his application was formally accepted on 4 June 2020. At the time of his application, the applicant stated that he had left his country of origin 4 years previously. He has not yet applied for international protection in Slovenia, but he has applied in Italy, where he holds a passport. He has been in Slovenia since October 2019. The applicant said that he was applying now because he had been in prison, and in prison he did not know that he could apply for international protection. Immediately after his entry into Slovenia, he was caught and put in prison. He was in Italy waiting for a decision on his application for international protection, but in the meantime he made a mistake and went to Slovenia, where he went to prison. He is seeking international protection in Slovenia because he is at risk in Pakistan. <p/> 3. According to the defendant, the condition for restriction of movement laid down in Article 84(3)(1) of the International Protection Act ('the IPA-1') is fulfilled. Given that the applicant had previously applied for international protection also in France and Italy, and then went to his country of origin and married there, and came back to Italy and then to Slovenia, the Court finds that by such actions he prevents any State from taking a substantive decision on his alleged problems in his country of origin. The applicant was also the subject of removal proceedings from the Republic of Slovenia, which he formally discontinued by lodging an application for international protection. For the above reason, the defendant rightly concludes that he made the application only with a view to delaying or obstructing the implementation of the removal. Since his arrest by the police on 11 October 2019, he has had the opportunity to apply for international protection, but has not done so. He could have made an application earlier and not only at the time of his detention in the Detention Centre, as he was certainly aware of this possibility in the light of his previous applications. <p/> 4. In the further reasoning of the decision, the defendant explains in detail why it is necessary to restrict the applicant's movements to the premises of the Aliens Centre and not to the asylum centre, where such a restriction of movement could not be sufficiently effective. The purpose of the restriction of movement could not be achieved by a less severe measure, since there are no appropriate mechanisms in the asylum centre to prevent the departure of the asylum seeker from the asylum centre. <p/> 5. The applicant brings the present action on all the grounds laid down in Article 27 of the Administrative Disputes Act (hereinafter 'the ADL-1'). In his application, he submits that he has been consistent in his statements throughout. He had already lodged an application for international protection in Italy on 2 August 2018 and before that in France (4 July 2017). In Pakistan, his entire family is in dispute with his uncle over land left by his grandfather. The uncle has taken this land and is now threatening the complainant and his brother. Therefore, it would be difficult for him to go back as he is afraid of his uncle. At the same time, he wishes he could sell the land and move to Italy or Slovenia with his family. That's why he applied for international protection here as soon as he got out of prison .... He did not lodge his application in Slovenia with the intention of delaying or obstructing his removal from Slovenia. His application is substantive and genuine and is not made to obstruct the proceedings. Furthermore, a measure of restriction of movement to the Aliens Centre may only be ordered where, in a particular case, a measure of restriction of movement to the asylum centre cannot be effectively implemented. The defendant could have ordered a mandatory detention order in the asylum centre, which would have been a proportionate measure. The applicant claims that the Court should allow the action and set aside the contested order and, in the alternative, that the Court should allow the action, set aside the contested order and refer the case back to the defendant for further proceedings. <p/> 6. The applicant also applied for an interim injunction together with the application, requesting the court to suspend the operation of the contested order pending a final decision on that order. The contested order infringes the applicant's right to personal liberty. <7. In its reply to the application, the defendant submits that the contested order is lawful and correct and therefore maintains it and requests that the action be dismissed as unfounded. <p/> Concerning point I of the operative part of the judgment: <p/> 8. <In reaching its decision, the defendant relied on Article 84(1)(3) of the MZM-1.  It follows from Article 84, paragraph 3, of the Law on the Protection of the Persons with Disabilities, that the competent authority may order an applicant to be subject to a measure of compulsory detention in the territory of an asylum home where the applicant's movement is restricted as a result of the return procedure pursuant to the Law on the Entry, Stay and Departure of Aliens in the Republic of Slovenia, in order to carry out and enforce the return procedure or the removal procedure, and where there are grounds to believe that the applicant has made the application only to delay or obstruct the implementation of the removal procedure, where he/she has had the opportunity to apply for international protection. It follows from the above provision that several conditions must be cumulatively fulfilled in order for this ground for restriction of movement to be established. One of the conditions is that it may be reasonably assumed that the applicant made the application only to delay or impede the execution of the removal, when he had the possibility to apply for international protection. The defendant based its presumption that the applicant had made the application solely for the purpose of obstructing removal on the fact that he had not made the application earlier, even though he could have done so. <p/> 11. The provision of Article 84(3)(1) ZMZ-1 implements Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on standards for the reception of applicants for international protection ('Reception Directive II') in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia. The above-mentioned provision of the ZMZ-1 implements Article 8(3)(d) of the Reception Directive II. It provides that an applicant may be detained where the applicant is detained for the purpose of return proceedings in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2008 on the application of the European Return Procedure (Directive 2008/115/EC). The Member State concerned may, on the basis of objective criteria, including the fact that the applicant has already had the opportunity to initiate the asylum procedure, conclude that there are reasonable grounds to believe that he/she is making the application solely to delay or impede the execution of the return decision. Furthermore, Article 8(3) of the Reception Directive II further provides that the grounds for detention are to be defined in national law. <p/> 12. That provision therefore expressly provides that the presumption that an applicant has made an application solely for the purpose of delaying his or her return may be justified on the basis of objective criteria. However, the current ZMZ-1 does not contain such objective criteria, which means that the above-mentioned provision of the Reception Directive II has not been fully implemented in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia and, therefore, Article 8 of the Reception Directive II is directly applicable in accordance with the principle of primacy. Therefore, since the objective criteria have not been incorporated by the legislator into the ZMZ-1, it is not possible to restrict movement on this legal basis until the ZMZ-1 has been amended accordingly (Article 84(1)(3), first indent, ZMZ-1). The ZMZ-1 should lay down criteria by which it could be reasonably concluded whether an applicant has lodged an asylum application for the sole purpose of withholding his/her removal. Such objective criteria should also be laid down in the law in order to respect the basic principles underlying Reception Directive II. Thus, the introductory part of the cited Directive states in point 15 that the detention of applicants should be applied in accordance with the basic principle that a person should not be detained solely because he or she is seeking international protection, in particular in accordance with the international legal obligations of the Member States and Article 31 of the Geneva Convention. An applicant should only be detained in very clearly defined exceptional circumstances, as provided for in this Directive, and taking into account the principle of necessity and proportionality as regards both the manner and the purpose of such detention. <p/> 13. Therefore, since Reception Directive II explicitly provides in its introductory part that detention may only be carried out in very clearly defined exceptional circumstances, the criteria for presuming that someone has made an application solely for the purpose of obstructing removal must be sufficiently defined in law, and, as already explained, the current MHC-1 does not contain such objective criteria. The mere fact that an applicant lodges an asylum application at the time when removal from the country is being carried out does not in itself mean that he has lodged it solely for the purpose of obstructing removal, having regard to the fact that it is apparent from the data in the Eurodac database, which form part of the administrative file, that the applicant had previously lodged an application for international protection in Italy and France. <p/> 14. The Court further observes that the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia has already examined the correctness and lawfulness of the decision in cases X Ips 1/2019 and X Ips 11/2019 concerning Article 84(1)(5), first indent, of the ZMZ-1, which refers to Article 28 of Regulation 604/2013/EU ('the Dublin III Regulation'), and thus to the risk of absconding referred to in Article 2(n) of the Dublin III Regulation, which provides that the risk of absconding must be established on the basis of the objective criteria laid down by the law. The Supreme Court, in its judgments in the cases cited above, found that these criteria (despite Article 31(2) of the MZZ-1, which deals with the risk of absconding in a blanket manner) are not present in the MZZ-1, and that there is therefore no legal basis for the imposition of such a measure of restriction of movement. In the present case, the objective criteria for the defendant to be entitled to reasonably assume that the applicant is applying for international protection only to delay or impede the implementation of the return decision are not laid down in the law. The Court therefore concludes that there is no legal basis for the imposition of a movement restriction measure under Article 84 § 84 (3), first indent, of the MLM-1 in the present case either. <15. Since the Court of First Instance considers that, in the present case, there is therefore no ground for restriction of movement under the third indent of Article 84(1) of the ZMZ-1, the Court of First Instance annuls the contested decision on the basis of Article 64(1)(4) of the Causes of Action Act. Since the Court annulled the order on the ground that it had erred in the application of substantive law, it did not rule on all the other pleas relied on by the applicant in the application. <p/> 16. Article 84(6) of the CTMO-1 provides that the court shall, after hearing the applicant orally beforehand, decide on the applicant's application within three working days. It is clear from the draft ZMZ-11 that the hearing is to be held on the grounds of a substantial interference with the applicant's liberty, i.e. in his favour. However, in the present case, where there is no adequate basis for the measure of restriction of movement under Article 84(3), first paragraph, first indent, of the ZMZ-1, a hearing of the applicant would even achieve the opposite purpose. The holding of a main hearing would therefore be an end in itself; at the same time, the principle of the economy of proceedings would be infringed, since the court would have to ensure the applicant's presence, provide him with an interpreter and represent him by proxy in order to hear him, thereby incurring unnecessary procedural costs. Nor was the defendant's right to be heard thereby infringed, since he was served with the application, to which he replied. <p/> On point II of the operative part of the judgment: <p/> 17. The Court dismissed the application for interim measures, applying mutatis mutandis Article 36(1)(6) Causa-1, on the ground that, in the light of the decision on the application for interim measures, the applicant had no legal interest in the interim proceedings. In accordance with Article 73(1) of the Causes of Civil Procedure Act, no appeal is allowed against that judgment and, since no appeal is possible, the court's judgment (point I of the operative part of the operative part of the judgment) means that the court has given a final decision on the matter, and the applicant therefore no longer has a legal interest in the interim injunction, which is time-bound until the final decision. The final judgment of that judgment in itself terminates the restriction of movement, since the order for restriction of movement has been lifted.",Legal/Regulation,train

Probably every one of us has a room in which we relax the best and easiest, and for me it's definitely my living room, which I have furnished to suit my needs. I remember that when I was buying a new living room, I spent an enormous amount of time, because I was quite a demanding buyer. Every man will probably agree that there is nothing better than half-lounging in front of the television in your living room and enjoying watching football, laughing while listening to politicians or simply watching one of the popular science channels. I have the habit of sometimes using my living room for reading, because I like to read a lot. It is also the case in our house that the living room is where we spend most of our time when we are not working, of course. But I am one of those people who does not like to visit my living room, because I am of the opinion that living rooms are in a way too private a place to invite friends into. After all, there is nothing more reassuring to me than being able to lie down in front of the television in my living room in just my underpants. <p/> Living room ideas <p/> Sometimes a friend asks me where I got the idea for my original living room. My living room is custom-made, and most of the time it's a collection of all the best ideas I've got from different furniture catalogues. I have to admit that I like the Scandinavian type of furniture because everything is made of wood, and that's what my living room is. Wooden living rooms are something special for me. It is the wood that gives the living room warmth and makes it feel homely. <p/> Sometimes you can get a good idea in the furniture showrooms themselves. Maybe you should go to a furniture showroom on a Saturday morning and see what kind of living rooms they have on display. Sometimes you will get an incredible amount of ideas.

644,"Wordsmith - P <p/> packet <p/> The largest unit that can be transmitted over a network at one time. Messages created by an application are split into several parts and compressed into different packets for transmission over the network. Each packet is sent separately and can use different access to the destination. When all the packets have reached their destination, the destination computer reassembles all the packets into the original message. This is the basic function of the packet exchange mode in a network. <p/> packet filtering <p/> A firewall technique that prevents certain packets from accessing the network. Packet filters can be created based on hardware addresses, IP addresses, port numbers or other criteria. For example, a router can be configured to allow only certain computers to access the Internet or to deny its own computers access to certain network servers. Although this feature is usually used only to protect against intrusion of other computers into your network, it can also be used to restrict certain LANs on your private inter-network. <p/> packet switching <p/> This is the process by which messages are broken into packets and sent through a router to facilitate transmission over a wide area network. These chunks (called packets) may take different paths to the addressee and may be sent in a different order than they were created, but the addressee is able to assemble these packets as they were sent. Packet switching allows computers to share a network with each other. If computers were to send messages all at once, they could block other computers from accessing the network for long periods of time. <p/> passive detection <p/> Recording of what happens on the network, which is saved to a file for the administrator to look at. <p/> passive hub <p/> The hub simply makes a physical and electrical connection between all connected stations.

Each computer also retains its own security settings that allow it to control access to its resources. Peer-to-peer networking is useful in smaller networks because no administration is required and users can keep their own security settings. In larger peer-to-peer networks, the network is not efficient enough because users need their own user account for each computer and because the access capabilities are less flexible and robust than those used by a server-based network. <p/> peer-to-peer network <p/> It is also a term for a file-sharing service on the Internet. <p/> physical layer <p/> The lowest layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model, which defines the type of network itself, how it should be installed and what types of signals it should carry. In the case of a LAN, the physical layer is highly correlated with the data layer, which is just above it, because the data layer contains similar specifications to the physical layer. <p/> ping <p/> A TCP/IP command in a command prompt used to test whether a computer is able to communicate with others on the network. Ping creates an ICMP packet and sends it to the computer specified in the command. The recipient sends it back as an ICMP reply. If the request times out, the host is unreachable. The system using ping then indicates the time between the message sent and the reply received.

For example, a printer that is connected to only one workstation will use a point-to-point connection. <p/> Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) <p/> A protocol at the data link layer that uses a dial-up line from the user to the ISP's terminal server. In contrast to its predecessor, the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP), PPP includes support for multiple network layer protocols, connection quality observation protocols, and protocols for authentication, error detection, security, dynamic IP addressing. PPP is used to connect between only two computers and therefore does not need as many features as local area network protocols, such as address fields for each packet and a media access control (MAC) mechanism. <p/> Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) <p/> A data link layer protocol for remotely connecting a computer to a tunnel over the Internet. The protocol allows a secure virtual private network (VPN) to be created, allowing a user to access a server on a shared network via a secure direct connection over the Internet. The entire data link layer frame generated by the application is encapsulated in an IP datagram. This procedure violates the rules of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model, but ensures that the entire PPP frame is encrypted in the IP datagram. <p/> port <p/> A code number that identifies a process running on a computer with a TCP/IP protocol stack. Transport layer protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) specify the number of source and destination ports in the header of each message they generate. The combination of IP address and port number identify a particular application on a particular computer or network. Port numbers up to 1024 are referred to as well-known port numbers, which are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the Internet's numbering authority, to ordinary applications. For example, the TCP port number is a well-known port number for network servers. Numbers greater than 1024 are short-lived port numbers, since they are chosen by clients in random order for each transaction they make with the server. <p/> port <p/> A port is a socket on a computer or other network device for connecting cables to other devices. <p/> Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) <p/> An application layer protocol used to transfer e-mail from an SMTP server to a network client. The Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) is used for traffic between servers and for outgoing mail at the client. <p/> presentation layer <p/> This is the sixth layer (second from the top) of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It is responsible for data presentation, data compression, data encryption and the conversion of file graphic commands (e.g. mouse movement) into commands and code table conversion. The computer translates the data generated by its applications from its syntax into a common syntax suitable for transmission over a network. When the data arrives at a particular address, the presentation layer translates this plain syntax into the syntax used by that computer. <p/> promiscuous mode (common mode) <p/> Operational mode is only possible on certain network interfaces that cause the interface to read and process all packets sent over the local network, not just packets addressed to it. Common mode is used by protocol analysers to subsequently analyse general patterns of network traffic. <p/> protocol <p/> Specifies some predefined set of rules that govern how a computer or device communicates and exchanges data on a network. A protocol is actually a language that a computer uses to communicate. The second computer to which the first is connected must use the same language in order for them to communicate. Computers use many different protocols to communicate, which has given the OSI reference model, which defines the layers at which different protocols operate, a higher value. <p/> protocol suite, protocol stack <p/> A set of protocols that interact with each other are used to communicate with other computers with the same protocol stack. Even though each protocol stack is based on the ISO/OSI reference model, it is not necessary that a given protocol stack will have all the layers of the OSI model. For example, on a computer connected to a local area network, the protocol stack consists of application layer protocols, data link layer protocols and a physical layer specification. <p/> Signalling scheme used in the 1000BaseT gigabit version of Ethernet.

These multiple links provide redundant connections. <p/> physical port <p/> An access point for a network device that allows a cable of a specific type to be connected. A port allows a device to connect to another device via a cable. <p/> A network topology that forms a ring shape. Data travels along the ring in one direction and each device on the ring acts as a regenerator, maintaining the signal as it travels. Each device includes a receiver for the incoming signal and a transmitter to send the data to the next device in the ring. The network depends on the capability of the signal travelling around the ring. <p/> physical star topology <p/> Describes a network in which a cable is routed from each network entity to a central device called a star. The star allows all devices to communicate if they are directly connected to it. <p/> physical topology <p/> The physical topology of a network can be a bus, star, ring or full topology. <p/> Ping of Death <p/> ICMP sends a flood of large packets to a remote host. At that point, the host usually restarts or hangs itself. <p/> plenum-rated coating <p/> A coating on coaxial cable that does not produce toxic gas when it burns. <p/> power blackout <p/> A complete loss of power that can last from a few seconds to several hours. <p/> A condition where the power drops below normal for a few seconds and returns to normal <p/> Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) <p/> Software for implementing RSA encryption. <p/> print server <p/> Central device that controls and manages networked printers.

A proxy server is an application that runs on a computer with an internal IP address, when the client uses an external IP address (i.e. the one given to it by the ISP), so that the internal IP addresses are then invisible to the Internet. The client application is configured by sending Internet service requests within the broker server and the broker server sends these requests to the appropriate Internet server using its external IP addresses. When it receives a response from the Internet server, it sends it back to its client. The intermediary server is dedicated to specific applications only and the client must be configured with the addresses of this server. The administrator can also configure it. <p/> public <p/> Can be used by anyone, of course under certain conditions. <p/> public key <p/> A technology that uses two keys for expedited communication, a public key and a private key.

668,"Strong outburst in the sun ! <p/> The activity of the Sun is of growing importance to humanity as we are increasingly dependent on global connections, the vast majority of which are via satellites. The Earth is shielded from the flow of material from the Sun by a magnetic field. <p/> However, in the event of a major flare, some particles will slip through and hit the Earth's atmosphere, which can affect surface infrastructure during so-called geomagnetic storms. The Earth is shielded from the flow of material from the Sun by its magnetic field. However, in stronger eruptions, some particles slip through and hit the Earth's atmosphere. What is the risk of this happening ? <p/> (Dr Primož Kajdič -)These outbursts, and if the conditions are right, then some of these particles may indeed enter the Earth's ionosphere or atmosphere, especially near the north and south magnetic poles. Then these particles, because they have very high energy, cause radiation and we then see this as the aurora borealis. The second thing that happens is that the Earth's magnetic field changes dramatically and this is then called a geomagnetic storm. But in general, changes in the Earth's magnetic field due to external solar winds and other phenomena, what we call space weather, are also felt on Earth. They can cause damage to our electrical wiring, our satellites can also burn up, stop working, astronauts' lives could be in danger, and so on. Such phenomena have occurred in the past. Then, with every solar cycle, we move more and more into space, more and more dependent on the technology that is in space. In the future, it will be very important to study these phenomena on the Sun and in the solar wind, because we will be more and more sensitive to them. We will need to find out how we can protect ourselves against them in order to minimise the damage. <p/> One more thing about the Sun itself. <p/> The Sun contains 99.8% of the mass of the Solar System. The rest of the mass is mostly found in Jupiter, with only a small fraction shared by all the other celestial bodies in the Solar System. The Sun is a perfectly average G2 star. In size, it is one of the 10% largest stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which is made up of around 100 billion stars. The average size of stars in the Milky Way is less than 50% of the size of the Sun. <p/> The present Sun is made up of 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and the rest is all other chemical elements. The Sun is slowly converting hydrogen into helium. This releases various waves which are detected on Earth as heat, light and various radiations. The Sun rotates on its axis. But because it is a big gaseous ball, its parts rotate at different speeds. It makes one revolution every 25.4 days at the equator and one every 36 days at the poles. It has a core in the centre that is 25% of its total diameter. The core rotates uniformly and behaves like a solid body. The surface of the core is under hellish conditions. The core has a surface temperature of 15.6 million Kelvin and a pressure of 250 billion atmospheres. The fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium nuclei produces a huge energy of 386 billion billion kilowatts every second. Thus, every second, 700 million tonnes of hydrogen are transformed into 695 million tonnes of helium. 5 million tonnes per second are gamma rays penetrating through the solar mantle to the photosphere. The photosphere is the surface of the Sun that we can see. As it travels through the sun's mantle, the strength of the radiation is reduced as it returns to the core. Some of the radiation just reaches the edge of the photosphere and flies off the Sun as visible light and thermal radiation. The temperature of the photosphere is 5800 degrees Kelvin. Sometimes we see darker sunspots on the surface, these have a temperature of 3800 degrees Kelvin. Sunspots are formed by the influence of the Sun's magnetic field. However, the way they are formed has not yet been satisfactorily explained. Above the photosphere, there is a thin chromosphere. Above this is the extremely thin corona. This extends millions of kilometres into space. It is visible at solar eclipse as a brilliant ring. The temperatures of the gases in it can reach up to a million degrees Kelvin. <p/> The Sun's magnetic field is extremely strong and extends far beyond Pluto. At the edge of this field is thought to lie the Oort Cloud of icy celestial bodies, the outermost edge of our Solar System. As well as heat and light, the Sun also emits a faint stream of electrified particles. These are mainly electrons and protons. These are called the solar wind. The Sun radiates them at a steady 450 km/second. Only when there are large outbursts, visible as giant flares or protuberances, does the intensity of the solar wind increase. Sunspots and prominences occur on a fairly regular 11-year cycle. But the solar wind affects the paths of artificial satellites, pushing them further and further off course. It pushes lighter particles out of icy celestial bodies, comets, and forms their tails. In larger outbursts, solar wind particles also hit the Earth's magnetic field. This brings it closer to the surface and the solar wind particles hit particles in the Earth's atmosphere. This creates the coloured aurora borealis, or northern lights. The particles are also dangerous to humans and astronauts must wear protective clothing. In the event of a major outbreak, they must take refuge in specially protected areas of the space station. It would be possible to build a spaceship with a sail that uses the steady pressure of the solar wind for propulsion. <p/> The Sun is 4.5 billion years old, the same age as our Solar System. Since its formation, it has consumed about 50% of the hydrogen. So they predict it will shine as brightly as ever for another 5 billion years. At the end of its lifetime, it will have expanded by half its present size. When it has used up all its hydrogen, it will radically change and swallow all its planets into itself.",Information/Explanation,train

674,"Trampling on the Constitution instead of taking responsibility <p/> The Information Commissioner has caught the police illegally obtaining data on the readers of online portals. Instead of taking responsibility, the ministry wants to legalise the actions of the police. Even though they are against the Constitution. <p/> If someone is warned that his actions are breaking the law, if he is reasonable, he will stop those actions. The police and the Ministry of the Interior see things slightly differently - instead of stopping illegal activities, they would legalise them. Even if this legalisation is contrary to the Constitution. <p/> But let us take it in turn. In January this year, we published a report by the Information Commissioner on the podcrto.si website, which found repeated illegal behaviour by the police in obtaining data from web portal operators. In the vast majority of cases, the police have requested information on the identity of readers and commenters on online portals from portal operators without a court order. However, the Act on Electronic Commerce on the Market stipulates that the police can only obtain such information with a court order. However, according to the Information Commissioner's findings, in 2012 the police obtained information on readers only four times with a court order. In the remaining 31 cases, it requested it bypassing the courts. <p/> Much of the media did not pay attention to these findings. This is understandable - in 23 cases, the media operating online portals provided the police with the identity of their readers, even though they did not have a court order to do so. In this way, they themselves were complicit in breaking the law. <p/> What is more surprising is the reaction of the police and the Ministry of the Interior, which is the superior authority of the police. Instead of holding the police accountable and punishing the guilty for repeatedly breaking the law, they have responded to the Information Commissioner's findings by creatively interpreting the law, which may, after all, allow them to obtain information bypassing the courts. This is how they brought to light Article 149b of the Criminal Procedure Act. The third paragraph of this article gives the police the possibility to request from operators, only at their written request, information on the owner or user of a particular means of electronic communications traffic which is not published in the subscriber directories. The intention behind the legal latitude is simple: the legislator wanted to make the police's job easier in cases where the police have the telephone number of a suspect but cannot find out his name because the number is not in the telephone directory. However, the police and the Ministry of the Interior have interpreted the provision creatively: operators of online portals could also be considered operators, and therefore they are obliged to provide data even without a court order. <p/> This lifeline of the police was eventually broken by the latter, after a series of correspondence between the Ministries of Justice, Economy and Higher Education, Science and Technology to establish the definition of an operator. It said that the Electronic Communications Act defines an operator as someone who manages a communications network. This, of course, is not what the web portals do. The MoI has now run out of excuses, and so at the end of February it admitted to the Information Commissioner that in almost all cases of data extraction the police had acted illegally. <p/> But the story does not end here. The MoI has decided to legalise the illegal activities of the police. By amending the Criminal Procedure Act (ZKP). The proposed amendment to the CCP, which is currently undergoing inter-ministerial coordination, would thus include service providers in the aforementioned Article 149b(3). According to the interpretation of the MoI, this would also require operators of web portals to provide information to the police only upon written request. This would make the hitherto unlawful practice legal. <p/> But there is one problem with this argument - the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. As the Information Commissioner points out, Article 37 of the Constitution guarantees the secrecy of letters and other communications, and only the law may prescribe that, on the basis of a court decision, the protection of the secrecy of letters and other communications and the inviolability of human privacy may be waived for a certain period of time if this is necessary for the initiation or conduct of a criminal proceeding or for the security of the state. Furthermore, in its 1997 decision, the Constitutional Court ruled that it is not only the content of the communication, i.e. the content of a letter, that is guaranteed, but also the circumstances of the communication, i.e. who communicated with whom and when. Thus, information about who accessed or commented on an internet portal is also constitutionally protected communication data. The police can therefore only obtain it by court order, no matter what law they write. This is because the Constitution, as the supreme law, is above the law. And given the experience of the Yugoslav secret services, it is understandable why the Constitution is so strict about obtaining communications data. <p/> The intentions of the police or the Ministry of the Interior in amending the Criminal Procedure Act are therefore worrying. Not so much from the point of view of the authorities' desire to make it easier to obtain data on the readers of online portals, but because of the intention to blatantly flout constitutional provisions. The latter are the cornerstone of the rule of law, and trampling on them puts us as a society in great danger. <p/> Therefore, if law enforcement authorities wish to obtain communications data bypassing the courts, they should pursue this desire through legal channels. By proposing an amendment to the Constitution. This route is, of course, infinitely more difficult than amending the law - it requires the consent of two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly. But it is the only permissible one. And it is the only one that would trigger a proper public debate on the proposed amendments. <p/> If the proposed amendment to the CPC were nevertheless adopted, and the police then started to obtain communications data bypassing the courts, in violation of constitutional provisions, we would face another problem. Evidence obtained in this way will not be taken into account by the courts, as it will have been obtained illegally. For example, the actors in the Balkan Warrior case were acquitted because of illegally obtained evidence. In court, the police were unable to explain how they obtained the telephone numbers of the defendants, who were then wiretapped. The numbers were not made public. Under the Constitution, it would have had to prove that it had obtained them legally - either by court order from the mobile phone operator or by some other legal means, such as from police colleagues. The judges then ruled as they were obliged to do under the Constitution and the law. They threw out the illegally obtained wiretaps and acquitted most of the defendants. According to the then Director of the Criminal Police Directorate, Jurij Fermet, the police were ""shocked"" by the verdict. Well, history is repeating itself now, and new shocks seem to be just around the next corner.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

681,"MIHA ŠALEHAR: 'We live in a brainwashed age' <p/> Miha Šalehar is definitely one of those people with whom you can easily get into an hour-long debate over a beer. But as it was a bit early on a Tuesday morning for such a thing, coffee was more than a suitable substance. Especially for a discussion about books, music, mass dehumanisation and more. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Given the nature of your shows and articles, the first question seems more than appropriate: who is Miha Šalehar anyway? <p/> Miha Šalehar: Yes, Miha Šalehar. Really, thank you for asking me the hardest question right from the start (laughs). Let me think. I am definitely not the same person for my home and for my listeners or readers. As far as sentiments are concerned, I think sometimes I get on everybody's nerves, and other times I am amusing to them. Sometimes they don't understand me very well. Let's just say that is my red thread. <p/> ROCKER.SI: With the arrival of autumn, new seasons of all kinds of reality shows will start or have started on TV. Along with them, there will be scandals and things like that, which you often deal with in your articles. I assume you have already accumulated some material over the summer? <p/> Miha Šalehar: If you mean the show Latrina, it's still on hiatus for once, but that may change soon. Personally, I don't watch reality shows very often, make no mistake. But my friends have been sending me all sorts of stuff from the domestic scene, and I've accumulated a lot of material in the meantime (laughs). <p/> But it slowly dawns on me that everything, our lives in general, have become one big reality show. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Let's stop a little bit with Babewatch, which you and your brother Matevž formed in the late 1990s. How do you look back on those days, almost twenty years later? <p/> Miha Šalehar: It was definitely a wonderful time. Because the best thing is to be a mule, to have a garage with an old beer fridge and to play rock 'n' roll with your own band. But I'm also glad that I left those waters and that those times have become just a pleasant memory of my youth. <p/> Miha Šalehar: No, to be revived, someone has to miss you first. Guns [Guns N' Roses] were missed. They miss Floyd [Pink Floyd] and R.E.M, but not Babewatch, please. Apart from two obscure fans from Primorska, nobody misses us. We were kids, we had a good time, the rest is history. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Let's touch on your recently published collection of columns called The Spirit of Something. Where did the idea for such a venture come from? <p/> Miha Šalehar: The idea didn't come from me at all, but from the editor Nina Žitko Pucer. To be quite honest, I thought it was a very lame idea at first. Who is going to read this? The columns are a thing that is published for the sake of weekly reading. And I have never read a collection of columns myself. <p/> We were very surprised by the sales results. I think we are now on our third reprint, which is really incredible. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Would you say that Slovenians are good readers? <p/> Miha Šalehar: I would rather say that we Slovenians read the wrong things. It's not the fact that I'm a good writer that has contributed to the sales results, but the fact that I appear on the radio every week. <p/> I wouldn't say that Slovenians are good readers if they read me (laughs). <p/> I'm afraid of the fact that it's easier to sell 3000 copies of books nowadays than 500 copies of studio records. On the other hand, it makes me happy that people are still willing to read one author, even me, in such large numbers. So that I don't just spit on myself and my readers (laughs). <p/> ROCKER.SI: Was there any negative reaction to the book's publication? <p/> Miha Šalehar: Of course, there's never a shortage of that. Although I'm quite lucky around that myself. I think most people understand that I try to be honest and fair in my work, which is why there hasn't been much criticism. It is also true that I am sometimes abusive in that, but that has nothing to do with honesty itself. <p/> However, some criticism was published before the actual publication of the book. These seem to me to be the most relevant. If you are a public figure, which by the definition of my profession I am, criticism is to be expected. It's perfectly normal to swallow a good truckload (or more) of shit on your own account over the years. Especially because of the seemingly democratic society we live in, where any c*ck* can write whatever they want under a pseudonym. The content of online comments has become juicier than signed copyright stuff. It is the sort of thing that I would take the greatest pleasure in shutting down. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Something along the lines of Oscar Wilde, give a man a mask and he'll tell you the ""truth""? <p/> Miha Šalehar: Sort of, but I'm afraid that people in masks are not acting in the service of actual truth. If you want to see who is creating our reality, read the online comments. It's really, really scary stuff. <p/>What has caused us to become such hateful primitives, I have no idea. But I console myself that it is very likely just a handful of individuals who are roleplaying the topics mentioned. How is it possible that we are falling for them? <p/>I find it hard to imagine that 90% of people are idiots. Of course they are not, at least I hope not. It is a very small minority, less than 1%. How do they manage to have so much influence? <p/> ROCKER.SI: Does that sound like an idea for a book? <p/> Miha Šalehar: Not at all. This book concludes my oeuvre where I have explored the existence of a non-existent middle class. Starting with education and religion, where we are told who we are and what our world should be like. <p/> The book is not a stand-alone publication, but goes hand in hand with my work on the radio. <p/> The opus is coming to an end, because I am beginning to be interested in other things. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Where can our readers buy your book? <p/> Miha Šalehar: In all Mladinska knjiga bookshops. The network is very wide. They can meet me in person at the upcoming Slovenian Book Fair, where I will be present on Wednesday. I will be happy to chat with you and sign some books for you. <p/> Miha Šalehar: I always have a problem with that, because I don't want to appear patronising (laughs). <p/> Don't be fooled by everything you hear or read, it's one big scam. Be totally sceptical. It seems to me that we live in a dictatorship of media fear and marketing solutions that are offered to us by the advertising apparatus five minutes after the media have published the next series of horrors. <p/> We live in a brainwashed age, because we are all brainwashed.

The first distribution of vegetable and cereal baskets will start on Thursday, 12 May 2011, at 17:00 in the courtyard of the Biotikva farm in Limbuš near Maribor (Lackova cesta 267, 2341 Limbuš). At the end of May, the participating farmers will further expand their offer of vegetable baskets and will also offer fruit baskets to consumers. <p/> The ECHo association, which initiated and organises this project in Styria and Prekmurje, is pleased with the current response. 7 organic farms have joined the partnership and will provide consumers with weekly vegetable, fruit and cereal baskets, as well as other products from organic production and processing: spreads, juices, jams, bread, eggs, meat and dairy products. 34 consumers have chosen to buy organic food in the context of partner farming. This is the first attempt of this kind of sales between organic farmers and consumers without intermediaries in this part of Slovenia. With this project, the association wants to promote the development of organic farming among farmers and to support organic farmers. <p/> What is partnership farming? <p/> Partnership farming is a new way of linking farmers and consumers in Slovenia. Different models (CSA - Community Supported Agriculture) have proliferated around the world, but they have a common denominator: they promote local, sustainable and ethical consumerism, with a special emphasis on solidarity among small farmers who farm without synthetic fertilisers and sprays. Typically, it is one farmer or a group of farmers who sell their produce to 20 to 30 customers. Before the sowing season, the farmer talks to the consumers about their wishes, clear rules are agreed, then the farmer sows the area and supplies the crops according to organic production technology and regulations. The produce grown on the agreed area is distributed weekly to the consumers. <p/> Once consumers have opted in, they meet the farmer and other consumers each week at an agreed date, time and location to collect their basket. They can also exchange produce and products with each other. In this way, the farmer supplies his consumers every week throughout the year with organic food that is truly fresh and has a very short transport route from the field to the plate. This way, the consumer knows exactly who grows their food, where and how. Consumers receive high quality organic food and the farmer is able to live with dignity as a result of this cooperation.",News/Reporting,train

This is followed by a rolling process, either by machine or by hand, which extracts the juice with enzymes. The following fermentation phase is the most delicate part of the black tea production process. It is carried out at a temperature of 27 degrees, with the addition of moisture, and the essential oils are extracted. During this process, the leaves are coloured black, and finally the tea leaves are dried with hot air and separated by size through sieves. <p/> In general, black tea has a stronger flavour and contains more caffeine than less oxidised tea (green, oolong or white). Unlike other teas, it retains its flavour for several years and, despite oxidation during processing, acts as an antioxidant. <p/> Flavouring tea became popular in the 19th century.The most famous flavoured black tea is undoubtedly Earl Grey with bergamot oil, but other flavourings are also used (vanilla, coconut, almond, mint, etc.).",Information/Explanation,train

Extended individual and team treatment focuses on the child and the whole family. <p/> As of 1 January 2019, a new Act on Integrated Early Treatment of Children with Special Needs came into force. This has transformed the former development clinics into Early Treatment Centres for Children with Special Needs by strengthening the teams with an increase in the number of medical staff and other professionals. The development clinic with an Early Treatment Centre at the Soboga Hospital will provide extended individual and team treatment by a specialist paediatrician, physiotherapist, registered and paramedical nurse, health administrator, occupational therapist, speech and language therapist, social worker, special educator, psychologist and other specialists as needed. The ground floor of the old maternity hospital building was renovated to accommodate the expanded development clinic. This means that there are now 3 modern, well-equipped outpatient clinics, which are easily and friendly accessible, even for the most physically handicapped. <p/> A very important innovation of the new approach to children with special needs is the involvement of the child's family and multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary teamwork in their treatment. The centres or extended development clinics are linked to kindergartens, primary schools, the social work centre and others. In this way, all the stakeholders involved in the treatment of a child with special needs and his/her family are brought together to form a whole that provides systemic support to families. <p/> In Slovenia, around 400 children with special needs are newly included in early intervention each year, while a total of 1 200 children receive early intervention in the pre-school period.

705,"Publishing <p/> DI Kranjska Gora: Visiting elderly and sick members <p/> Chatting. <p/> In addition to these two names, the month of December, or December, has a championship in popular naming. To name but a few: Happy December, the craziest month, the month with the most lonely people, the month with the most holidays, the month with the millions of cards said, the month with the most goodies on the plates, the month with the craziest spending, the month of taking out loans for a few hours of crazy eating, the month of merchants, the month of children's joys, the month of mass temporary resettlement, the month of crazy behaviour, and I could go on and on. <p/> The purpose of my writing, however, is to shed some light on the designation, 'the month with the loneliest'. Why shine a light on something that is always more hidden than revealed? All our disabled people's associations are experiencing more and more members from the third age group. I am not saying that there is no loneliness in the younger groups of people, but it is clear that it is in the group of people in the third stage of life that there is the greatest loneliness. This is the generation that has already finished its working and creative task in life, has gone into the solitude of its retirement. <p/> The fallacy that everyone can hardly wait to retire is only true until you are about to leave your job for good and realise it. You have to leave the comrades who have kept you company for days and years, for better or for worse. The daily commute to work turns into looking out of the window and thinking how my comrades at work are doing. I count myself among the group that it took me two years to accept that I was no longer needed, that I was a tool that had outlived its usefulness. Even though I still had many social tasks and a lot of movement between people, it did not fill me up, so that I did not feel lonely and marginalised. Although I moved among the crowds, I always felt alone. I am not saying that this pattern applies to all of us who have retired, but I know that some of us felt marginalised, exploited in the workplace, and I know that they found it difficult to wait for the arrival of the last day at work. <p/> But this retirement has pushed the vast majority of people into isolation, at least temporarily, until they have found a job in some other area of society, and what if they have not? Usually these are the years when grandchildren come into the world, who somehow fill in society from work, but only temporarily. <p/> Filling time, which is too much at one time, can also lead to an incredible new burden of overwork and lack of time for oneself. This feeling leads to a new isolation, which makes one think that everyone has forgotten one's self and that one is just a tool of one's family or surroundings for as long as one is needed, and then one should get out from under one's feet for once. When, for many, there is the worm that sees that we are only waiting for our miserable end, loneliness reaches a peak that usually leads to a state of illness of mind and body, which is devastating for the individual. <p/> I myself am fortunate in that I am somehow still active in several areas, but it is also true that I always give myself just the right amount of time to myself so that I do not feel marginalised and lonely. But many times the thought creeps into my mind, yes, one day you will have to admit enough is enough, yes it is true, but I am pushing that thought into the future, when it will be, so why bother with it today. <p/> I am also fortunate to run a disabled people's association which employs me. Sometimes the work goes beyond what is reasonable, but that is only sometimes and when the state bureaucracy overreaches itself with tasks that benefit no one and we, through the associations, have to fulfil them. Running a society gives me the opportunity to chat with the membership more and more, which is like the salt of life. Chatting is usually a part or a courtesy of life when meeting people. If the main aim of chatting is to have a positive effect on the relationship and well-being of two or more people together, then I can say that chatting has an impact on the quality of the relationships between the membership. Chatting is typically a game of words. The basic rule of chatting is to strengthen mutual relations with elements of joking, fun, courtesy and to spend time together to avoid excruciating silence and to exchange different opinions on certain problems or events. Chatting has the aim of being friendly to other people and to the surroundings trapped in the same space. <p/> While chatting with the membership, I discover the phenomenon of loneliness of each member. Loneliness can be equated with talent, both components need to be discovered, neither is visible on its own. During December, this phenomenon is even more pronounced and killing. December is a month of anticipation, a month of planning a new path, a month of reckoning with the past tense, but also with the thought, everyone is going to have fun and rejoice, and it will be just me or myself for the holidays and the rejoicing. <p/> This thought leads many into a negative black mentality and even leads the slightly more unstable personalities into the thought of ending a sad life. In the Association we are aware of this situation of some of our members and we are working to raise awareness among the membership that loneliness and exclusion are most often caused by personal reflections and certainly not by social exclusion. <p/> In this month, which has only just begun, the Association of People with Disabilities of the municipality of Kranjska Gora has for years had a campaign to visit individual members who have been passive and more or less inactive over the year. The reason for the visit is usually justified by a small token of appreciation with a few sweets and a souvenir suitable for the December time. All this is cause for a short chat and a chat. <p/> Believe me, such a visit and a gift is the key that not only opens the front door of the home, it is also the key to the heart of the person being visited. A chat usually gives many answers which we had only suspected before. Whatever time our volunteers spend on such a visit, it always turns out in the end to have been too short and too measured. Usually, such a visit turns into indescribable happiness and joy, with the visitor realising that ""I am not forgotten by everyone yet"". I also take part in such visits as much as time permits and it fills me with a certain missing energy that I miss before such a visit, even though I am not even aware that I am missing it. <p/> The people who are visited are also aware of a certain helplessness and loneliness, but they do not know how to help themselves and get out of this cycle of loneliness. This is where our task as the leadership of the association comes in, to find the lonely members and help them to pierce the veil that keeps them in a certain vacuum of loneliness. This is what the mandatory seventh social programme, Preventing and alleviating the social and psychological consequences of disability, requires us to do. <p/> I dare say that we are an association with a good diversification of social work, but all the same we are left with a passive membership that cannot be animated into active membership. How to reach such a member and how to stimulate them is a Gordian knot whose shell we have not even raised, let alone broken. I am also aware that it will never be possible to raise everyone to the level of a working member. I am convinced, however, that we need to do more on this problem of inactivity and the results will come. Let me end my reflections with a greeting that is appropriate in these times, and I wish everyone good luck.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

712,"Mathematics Instruction for Primary School <p/> We may be the parent of a child who attends primary school and occasionally or regularly needs help with homework, or extra tuition before an exam because they may not be doing well in one of their subjects. But we no longer remember everything ourselves and find it difficult to help. Maths is usually the most difficult subject. And so perhaps maths tuition for primary school is needed. Mathematics is a big problem for many schoolchildren and they may need help from an expert to learn it. Maybe it is just a particular subject that is giving him difficulty, or whatever, and we are not confident enough in our own knowledge to be able to help him. And so we decide to use tutoring, which is usually the best possible solution and the appropriate help in this kind of situation. The great thing about tuition is that the instructor pays individual attention to the child, takes the time to look at what the difficulties are and makes a learning plan so that the material becomes clear and is understood as soon as possible. Whether the child is in primary school, secondary school or perhaps already studying. It is definitely a great way to help your child to get the knowledge they need and are currently lacking. What's also good about tuition is that the instructors identify the needs of the child and also have the right way or approach to teach them the most in a relatively short time. Of course, this is a great opportunity for those whose knowledge is deficient in a particular subject. When a child attends primary school, maths is usually the most pressing problem and, in general, if it is a child who is not good at maths in general, we will look for maths tuition for primary school. If we take on the task ourselves and want to help our child, we will surely find that primary school is not as easy as we once thought. We may not choose the right way of teaching, which would prolong learning, we may not have the right experience, and it is certainly different when someone other than the child's parent teaches the child.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
717,"Health Minister Aleš Šabeder sworn in before the National Assembly today, now he will have to speed up the rehabilitation of the health care system, starting with family medicine <p/> By Diana Zajec <p/> Article <p/> Ljubljana, 27 March 2019 <p/> Reading time: 6 min <p/> ""Our current workload is beyond the limits of what is bearable. Despite the difficult situation, we are persevering for the time being, mainly because of the understanding of the management, which is doing its best to find solutions, including by recruiting additional staff, which is not approved and financially covered by the Health Insurance Fund,"" wrote 14 family medicine doctors from the Grosuplje Health Centre in a letter addressed to the ministry today. They did so in the hope that the newly appointed Minister of Health, Aleš Šabeder, will realise that placing the burden on the already pressure-ridden shoulders of family doctors is not a solution. <p/> The doctors from the Grosuplje health centre informed the new Minister of Health, Ales Šabeder, of their decision (to strictly comply with the professional collective agreement and the standards and norms set out therein, and to refuse patients if this would exceed the 1895 head coefficients), the reasons for their decision (to improve working conditions so that they can provide professionally appropriate care to patients) and any further action - including dismissal - if they are subject to any pressure, threats, mobbing or punishment as a result of their decision. <p/> The workload in the outpatient clinics far exceeds the professional standards and norms that are a prerequisite for quality and safe patient care, and all doctors are involved in 24-hour emergency care (both on and off duty), as well as in the post-mortem examination service. <p/> Grosuplje Health Centre doctors will now strictly comply with the professional collective agreement and the standards and norms set out therein - and will refuse new patients if this would exceed the 1895 headache coefficients. <p/> They are convinced that this is the only way to improve working conditions and, as a result, provide patients with professionally appropriate care. <p/> ""In any case, in this situation we cannot and will not take on the additional burden of new registrations as provided for in the new General Agreement, and we have therefore decided to make this public in the attached statement. The statement has been shared with the representatives of the Institution's Council, who have unanimously supported us in this"", wrote Sonja Gruden, a specialist in family medicine, on behalf of the 14 doctors who will give priority to professionalism and ethics. <p/> The decision of the doctors working in the Grosuplje health centre is not an isolated one; similar reactions and announcements have been made in Kranj, Celje, Nazarje, Ajdovščina ... and will be accelerated elsewhere in Slovenia in the future.",News/Reporting,train
718,"What is it, apart from the understaffing and the overburdening, which is also or mainly administrative, that has broken the bottom of the primary health care barrel? <p/> The 2019 General Agreement exacerbates an unsustainable situation <p/> The 2019 General Agreement sets a new (increased) ceiling for registrations in family medicine outpatient clinics, which are already bursting at the seams with no systemic solutions. And this is very bad news indeed. <p/> The General Agreement, whereby the health 'partners' each year redefine the financial pie for the provision of health services and programmes, does not really have a partnership character, because the strength of the professional arguments is repeatedly undermined by the arguments of power, which in the end seem to have a single denominator: politics, which has nothing to do with health care. Controversial issues are always decided by the government. <p/> The Association of Health Care Institutions has proposed an annex to the General Agreement ... <p/> That is why the Association of Health Institutions of Slovenia has proposed the adoption of annex number one to the general agreement for this year. With regard to the overload in family medicine clinics in primary health care, where doctors in some health centres are announcing the termination of their employment contracts because there is no other solution on the horizon, this association has proposed a solution quite comparable to the conclusions recently adopted by the annual conference of the Fides doctors' and dentists' trade union. The proposed annex thus, rather surprisingly, puts doctors, their unions and the management of health care institutions on the same side. <p/> The proposal was made by the Association in accordance with the agreement on the suspension of strike activities signed by the Fides union and the government - and already in force in the general agreement for the 2017 and 2018 contract years. According to this agreement, primary care doctors can refuse to identify new insured persons once they reach the national average of the headache ratios for each specialty, while family medicine doctors and paediatricians can refuse to identify new insured persons once they reach a headache ratio of 1895. <p/> The Association of Health Care Institutions drafted the annex in accordance with the agreement on the temporary suspension of strike action. <p/> ... the ZZZS Board of Directors rejected the proposal <p/> Doctors may decide to take such a step if the employer has not exhausted all the human resources and organisational possibilities that would allow the definition of insured persons - tenders for new recruitments, proposal of the need for new specialisations, subcontracting of doctors, including retired ones, redirection of insured persons of full age from a paediatrician to a family doctor ... <p/> However, at yesterday's meeting, the ZZZS Board of Directors rejected the proposal to urgently include this option in the general agreement for this year. We are now in a situation in Slovenian healthcare where there is virtually no room for manoeuvre - for the time being in family medicine, but similar stories are unfolding in other branches of medicine too. And since this serious, complex problem is being pointed out not only by doctors or nurses and their unions, but now even by the management of health care institutions, this is a sign that the existing system is not, and can no longer be, a guarantee for the sustainable, high-quality, professional, comprehensive and safe operation of health care - a sign to which we urgently need to react and take immediate action to remedy the situation that has arisen. <p/> The proposal to urgently include this option in the general agreement for this year was rejected by the ZZZS Board. <p/> The association is convinced that the agreement between the government and the Fides trade union, enshrined in the agreement on the suspension of strike activities, should be respected - and that if the timetable for reaching the target norm had to be changed in this sense, the signatories to the agreement would have to resume negotiations and redraft the agreement. So what next - apart from the announced activities of primary care doctors? <p/> ""We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted"" <p/> ""We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted"" <p/> ""We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted. One is to continue with the annex procedure, but this kind of search for a solution is time-consuming and could drag on until the autumn. There is also another way. The new Minister for Health will have to deal with these problems as soon as he is appointed - and it is not impossible that the partners who are agreeing on the content of the general agreement will not be able to come up with a coherent, possibly even new, proposal to alleviate the acute situation we are witnessing at the moment. I can assure you that the association will be cooperative, because it wants to contribute to a reasonable solution - but if we find ourselves in a situation where emotions and other motives prevail, it will be difficult to find a solution,"" said Marjan Pintar, Director of the Association of Health Care Institutions, speaking to Health Portal. <p/> And what is your message to the new Minister of Health, Ales Šabedr? <p/> What do you expect from the new Health Minister Ales Šabedr?

725,"Change municipality <p/> For a healthier lifestyle and mental health <p/> New health promotion centre in Celje For a healthier lifestyle and mental health Interest in group workshops and individual counselling <p/> Celje, 28 September 2016 - The Together for Health project was implemented at the National Institute of Public Health in 2015 and 2016 with funding from the Norwegian Financial Mechanism. One of the results of the Together for Health project is a new health promotion centre in the Celje Health Centre and the health posts Štore and Vojnik-Dobrna. The centre is aimed at people who are at any risk due to lifestyle, chronic non-communicable diseases or mental health problems. It offers a wide range of free workshops and individual counselling on physical activity, healthy eating, risky drinking, smoking cessation, living with diabetes, relaxation and stress management, and coping with anxiety and depression. This year, from January to mid-September, more than 1600 individuals were involved in health promotion workshops and individual counselling in Celje, Štore, Vojnik and Dobrna. The oldest participant was 96 years old and the youngest 16 years old. <p/> All services are free of charge for the participants, as they are covered by their health insurance entitlements. At the Health Promotion Centre of the Celje Health Centre, participants receive professional support, relevant information and knowledge, and above all, they form attitudes, acquire skills and develop new behavioural patterns for a healthier lifestyle and mental health. Along the way, they can progress and empower themselves, eventually making some lasting changes in their lives in terms of giving up risky habits. And if they are already ill (for example, diabetics), they can live better with a chronic illness with the experience and knowledge from the workshops. ""We provide preventive check-ups in family medicine referral clinics for all adults over 30 years of age. We aim to detect risk factors for chronic non-communicable diseases (e.g. high cholesterol, high blood pressure, blood sugar, obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, risky alcohol consumption) early enough to prevent the onset of the disease. The Together for Health project has provided the Celje Health Centre with a Health Promotion Centre, where appropriately trained professionals provide group workshops and individual counselling to help adults change unhealthy lifestyle habits. We have focused on implementing a community-based approach, especially trying to reach vulnerable groups of the population and reduce inequalities in health care,"" said Dr Jana Govc Eržen, Head of the Expert Group for Prevention and Health Promotion at the Celje Health Centre, Coordinator of the Celje - Healthy City project and National Coordinator for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention. Marjana Iršič, Head of the Health Promotion Centre at Celje Health Centre, explained. At the Health Promotion Centre in Celje, we have noticed that we have attracted people's interest in our non-medication programmes. Compared to the previous organisation, the new work design also includes vulnerable groups of people in an organised way, for whom some health services were harder to access. As one of the innovations, we have also tested the cooperation with an intercultural mediator for the Albanian-speaking community in Celje."" Vulnerable groups in terms of accessibility to the health system and involvement in prevention programmes include the unemployed, precarious workers, migrants, homeless people, people who use illicit drugs, people with mental health problems, Roma, people with various disabilities and all others who face different barriers to taking care of their health. <p/> The results and benefits of the Together for Health project were presented by health experts and programme users on Wednesday 28 September at the National House in Celje. The new community-based integrative approach to health promotion and prevention was presented by. Alenka Obrul (Director of the Celje Health Care Centre), Dr Jana Govc Eržen (Head of the Prevention and Health Promotion Expert Group at the Celje Health Care Centre and National Coordinator for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention), Jožica Maučec Zakotnik (Head of the Centre for Management of Health Promotion and Prevention Programmes at the National Institute for Health Promotion and Health Care and Head of the Together for Health for Adults Project), Dr. Mgr. Polonca Truden Dobrin (Head of the Together for Health project for children and adolescents), Marjana Iršič (Head of the Health Promotion Centre at the Celje Health Centre), Nuša Konec Juričič (Head of the Non-Communicable Diseases Group at the Celje Regional Unit of the NIJZ), Alenka Rumbak (Director of the Celje Unit of the Employment Service), Martin Kač (Karitas), Suzi Kvas (Director of the Socio Health Care Centre). Stanislava Ferjanc (participant in the programme) and Vera Haliti (intercultural mediator) also presented their experiences. <p/> Users of the Celje Health Centre and the health stations of Štore and Vojnik-Dobrna therefore have the opportunity to take part in one of the three basic workshops: Healthy Living, Am I Fit and Relaxation Techniques. There are also modules on high blood sugar, high fats, type 2 diabetes and physical fitness. These workshops and modules are followed by a variety of in-depth sessions. Among the possible programmes are three in-depth psychoeducational workshops to support mental health: Coping with Stress, Support for Coping with Depression and Support for Coping with Anxiety. ""The workshops provide participants with information on the link between physical and mental functioning, why certain problems occur and what they can do to improve their own health. In a small group, they have the opportunity to share experiences and ask what they are interested in. Excessive or prolonged stress can lead to physical or mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to mental health that makes it harder for many people to seek help - but I think that is slowly changing too. More and more people are recognising the importance of getting information and skills for their own health,"" said Maruša Naglič, psychologist and psychoeducational workshop leader at the Centre for Health Promotion. <p/> Health Promotion Centres, like the one in Celje, are already operating in Sevnica and Vrhnika. In the Together for Health project, led by Jožica Maučec Zakotnik in the field of adult health, the National Institute for Public Health upgraded the existing health education centres both in terms of organisation and content. The approaches are designed to respond to people's needs, with a practical focus on empowerment for long-term lifestyle changes that can lead individuals to better health and well-being. The new design, based on community engagement and the coordinated mobilisation of a wide range of local partners, makes it possible to strengthen care for individual and public health, optimise the use of resources for health promotion and prevention, ensure the quality of staff and programmes, and improve health indicators for the future. The National Institute of Public Health stressed that the experience gained so far from the pilot programmes confirms the rationale for introducing health promotion centres in other health centres. Following the completion of the Together for Health project, the Health Promotion Centre in Celje is fully supported by the National Health Insurance Fund. <p/> *** <p/> Additional information.

Or you can type in a place like Ljubljana and get Ljubljana treasures, etc... If you want to do more, like see what's going on with individual treasures or even enter your own adventures related to the treasure you're looking for, you have to register for free. If you do this, you will get the geographical coordinates of where the treasure is located and a hint of where exactly it should be. You can stand on it, but if the owner of the treasure doesn't give you a hint that it's buried under your feet, you'll be looking for it in vain. You can, however, pay approx. 20?per year, which gives you the right to hide the treasure, enter its coordinates in the portal and keep track of what happens to it, who discovers it, etc. If you find the treasure, you enter the date of its discovery in the treasure's notebook. You can take some things out and put in some of your new things, or at least as much as there was before. Each treasure contains a plastic waterproof box, a label with the location and address, a pencil, a pencil sharpener, and a notebook or notepad. You can also put anything in the box that is not food, not an animal or non-perishable. Crates can be ""micro"" e.g. a 2 or 3 cm plastic box, medium or very large. The crate can also contain a ""tracer"" or a plastic coin. You need to buy both official ones because the tracking numbers are stamped on the tracker and the coins are destructible and only made by certified producers. The tracker is inscribed separately and its job is to travel from treasure to treasure. You must not take it home for permanent safekeeping, but must put it in another treasure or leave it where it is. If you have moved it, you must be sure to write on the portal in which treasure you have placed it. Some people call this a ""stopwatch"". Vendors also offer official boxes, notebooks, pencils, stickers, etc. You don't need these if you don't want them. You can provide all this yourself. You can get free stickers here: http://www.techblazer.com/geocaching-log-sheets/ for micro for others: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=w ... mApU8vtHzw Make sure the sticker is dry! That's all. Instead of boring walks, you can search for treasures. You can use a garmin or other gps, I just use a phone with gps built in. It's worth installing Google Earth and you'll find your treasure even faster. If anyone has any other questions, just take them on the day. <p/> Reply Written by bucar "" Sat May 05, 2012 12:13 am <p/> Commendable, but one has to be careful here: it's nice if a video post about a treasure is aligned with its owner, especially if the location of the box itself is also shown (spoiler). Many an owner would not be thrilled about that! Some time ago there was a pop-TV article http://24ur.com/novice/it/sodobno-iskan ... ladov.html and later on Spica there was another box right next to the real one and now there is quite a confusion because there are two treasures with a registration book.

The solution is HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound), a treatment that uses focused high-intensity ultrasound technology to heat tissue at a specific depth with extreme, surgical precision, resulting in a direct lifting effect. It is the world's first wrinkle smoother, and depending on the depth of the wrinkle, it is possible to lift the eyelids by 3-4 mm, reduce the pores on the face, firm and lift cheekbones, etc. However, in cases where the eyelid is drooping due to nerve damage or is congenital, the device cannot achieve the changes and surgery is required.

However, realistic expectations are necessary, because the kind of taut face you see on Hollywood celebrities is the result of expensive surgical procedures, without which such extreme results cannot be achieved. <p/> The HIFU treatment is performed by a trained beautician who also provides training on this treatment for beauty salons throughout Croatia. So far, she has ""beautified"" more than 150 women from Croatia and Slovenia, so you too can find out why it is worth visiting the Tajna ljepote salon for facial rejuvenation. <p/> This revolutionary and unique device can: completely remove forehead wrinkles, lift eyebrows by 3-4 mm (by lifting the upper eyelids), soften or completely remove wrinkles around the eyes, soften or completely remove under-eye bags, tighten enlarged pores, firm and lift cheekbones, soften or completely remove nasolabial folds and nasolabial folds between the nose and the lip, tighten the skin of the neck, tighten and remove the chin, tighten the skin of the décolletage. <p/> Ultrasound Rejuvenation Treatment High-intensity ultrasound generates large amounts of collagen.

738,"VARSTOR, JERNEJ ŠTORGELJ, s.p.from Rečice ob Savinji specialises in robotic welding. They also perform welding by other processes such as MIG welding and TIG welding. <p/> WELDING <p/> Welding is the process of joining two materials to form a single unit by means of heat or mechanical kneading. <p/> In welding, the heat source is an electric arc generated by the welding machine. The joining of materials is based on the temperature generated by the electric arc. This welding process is called arc welding. <p/> WELDING PROCEDURES <p/> MIG/MAG welding <p/> MIG/MAG welding involves the generation of an electric arc by means of a welding source. The arc is formed between the welding wire and the weldment. The arc joins the weldment and the filler material to form a weld joint or weld. <p/> During the actual welding process, the feeding device feeds the wire continuously through the torch to the welding site. Shielding gas is also added via the torch. <p/> MIG welding differs from MAG welding in the use of shielding gas. MIG welding uses an inert gas which does not react chemically with the welding consumable. MAG welding, on the other hand, uses an active gas which reacts chemically with the weld metal. <p/> Typically, the shielding gas contains active carbon dioxide or oxygen, which is why MAG welding is more common than MIG welding. <p/> TIG welding <p/> In TIG welding (Tugsten Inert Gas), an electric arc is created between the non-fusible tungsten electrode and the weld metal. An inert gas is used as a shielding gas which does not react with the weld. The most commonly used shielding gas in TIG welding is argon. <p/> In TIG welding, the addition of material is not always necessary. The joint between two weldments can also be made by welding their edges. If material is added, it must be added manually. For this reason, TIG welding sources are built differently from MIG/MAG sources. <p/> The different TIG methods include DC, AC and pulsed TIG welding. <p/> MANUAL WELDING <p/> Welding processes <p/> Welding processes are divided into several phases according to the degree of automation, namely. <p/> Semi-automatic welding - a specific working step is carried out automatically. One such welding method is MIG/MAG welding, where the welding wire is fed through the torch by a feeding device. <p/> In mechanised welding, some manipulative work is also done by machine, with the welder controlling the welding process. <p/> In automatic welding, the welding hardware performs the entire process independently of the preset programme. <p/> Robotic welding represents a very advanced welding mechanisation and automation. In robotic welding, a control system controls the movement of the torch and the manipulation of the welder. The robot can be programmed for different welding applications, so we are talking about the highest possible level of automation of the welding process. <p/> Robotic welding is most commonly used for products where the surfaces to be joined are curved and where several small welds in different directions are required. The reason for the purchase is not necessarily for mass production of products. Modern technologies allow for the increasing production of smaller batches of products. Individual parts have also been successfully produced in robotic workshops.",Information/Explanation,train

Later, we can print it on pos via Invoice Viewer, but it is already copy 1. <p/> This would come into play when we give someone an offer and later they pay in cash and we give them a pos printout. I suggest that somehow we add the option to print via pos printer, whether it be ""Create pos invoice"" or some other option for pos printout and cash payment. Cash payment is already possible if we do not choose another payment type (TRR or card), just a pos printout would be welcome. <p/> As already stated ""if we do not choose another payment type (TRR or card)"", the invoice is entered as cash and is confirmed by FURS. For A4 printout, the invoice prints ok. However, if we print the invoice later via the ""Invoice Viewer"" on the pos printer, it does not print CASH at the very end, but FOR PAYMENT. <p/> When the option for pos printout is added already in the base, I guess this will be reconciled? <p/> Sorry, I don't know how to do it right. If the due date is set to a later date, it will print FOR PAYMENT in the pos statement, but CASH in the A4 statement, and if the due date is the same date as the invoice it will print CASH in both cases. <p/> However, it might be a good idea, if the upgrade is to be made so that the offer can also be used for cash payment and the pos printout, to automatically set the due date for cash payment to the invoice date, or to always print CASH, because we don't print the due date on the cash invoice itself, and it shouldn't be on the A4 printout of the cash invoice, because if we have a due date set for a later date in the offer, the invoice automatically takes it into account, and then the due date is later on the A4 printout, but the cash payment is today, for example.

But to help them do this even better, and to boost their function and health, you can help them with certain foods. <p/> Vegetables help to rebuild the internal organs. (Photo: FreeDigitalPhotos.net) <p/> The liver is an organ that regenerates every 150 days. Old cells are replaced by new ones so that the liver can continue to perform its function. The heart also regenerates, as many studies have shown. This happens about four times during a lifetime. The skin regenerates faster, every 28 days, bones take ten years, the intestines regenerate every few days, etc. We can also help our organs to do even better, to regenerate faster and to stay healthy, by eating more food. Foods such as blueberries, green tea, carnosine (found in pork, lamb and fish) are good for the nervous system. These foods help to regenerate stem cells. Other foods that also have a beneficial effect on organ regeneration, especially liver and stem cell regeneration, are turmeric, celery, parsley, artichokes, royal jelly, coffee, red wine, black grapes, green tea. Foods recommended for faster renewal of insulin-producing beta cells are: black cumin, curcumin, vitamin D - found in fish, eggs, cheese, red meat, avocado, melon, chard, brassicas. Vitamin C is recommended for hormone regeneration. For heart muscle regeneration, the following foods are recommended: red wine, oatmeal, pork, poultry, young cheese, wheat germ.

753,"Description: Intensive industrial agriculture, as the second largest polluter of the environment, is increasingly subject to public pressure for sustainable agricultural production. There are no indicators to assess the sustainability of the production system (PS) as a whole. The aim of this thesis was to design and evaluate a tool for sustainability assessment of arable (wheat, spelt and oil pumpkin) and vegetable (cabbage and beetroot) production in four CS (conventional - CON, integrated - INT, organic - ECO and biodynamic - BD), using data from a field experiment at FKBV in the 2008 season. The Sustainable Process Index ® (SPI) for agriculture calculates the environmental footprint in m2 of all direct and indirect inputs used during production. The analysis shows that the differences between the PS are large, and the partial results of the environmental footprint indicate where improvements are needed during the production process. The environmental footprint was highest in the KON (total 3,005,108.9 m2) and lowest in the control (642,906.2 m2), the reference PS, for all the crops observed. Wheat had the largest environmental footprint in the KON (792,646.8 m2) and oil pumpkin the smallest in the control (113,334.7 m2) PS. The calculated environmental performance index (environmental footprint per unit of yield - kg) confirmed the SPI trend in most cases. The SPI is a good and accessible tool to show the sustainability and shortcomings of the PAs for growers, the public and policy actors.

During its existence, it has hosted some of the leading names in high-tech, science and art, such as Hiroshi Ishiguro, Honda Robotics, Stelarc, Victoria Vesna, as well as local artists such as Robertina Šebjanič, Srečo Dragan and Laibach. <p/> The tenth anniversary was also an opportunity to take stock of the work done and to look to the future of the festival, which is one of only three of its kind that the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia recognises as being of high quality and renown, and for this reason also provides financial support for its implementation. In the spirit of the times and the development of both visual culture and technology, the festival's management decided to focus on virtual worlds and 3D environments. <p/> One of the flagship projects this year is the Brain Computer Hackathon, the first event of its kind in Slovenia. In addition, the Tree project, jointly developed by American artists Milica Zec and Winslow Porter, is also worth mentioning.

761,"Interview published in the professional magazine Isis, the newsletter of the Medical Chamber of Slovenia, January 2008 (27) <p/> On the occasion of the two-thousandth issue of the ZIB Bulletin <p/> Interview with Anka Štrukelj Fras, Editor <p/> Question. What is your experience? <p/> Answer. We can still write down what we did at the beginning when we invited readers to subscribe: the ZIB Bulletin is a daily online publication for healthcare needs. It is original, up-to-date, transparent, concise and independent. The motto of the ZIB Bulletin is Saving Time. It has been our experience that ZIB, as a miniature electronic publication consisting of short articles and lists of relevant documents and media releases, without images and enticing graphic supplements, has gained weight over the years. The more the pages of the World Wide Web are literally whittled down by these additions. In the face of the latter, content often becomes secondary or, even if it is good, awaits the reader locked behind a magic web door that takes time and money to open. Our readers, in particular, do not have time to spare. They include almost all the managers of Slovenian national, regional and local health institutions - hospitals, health centres, pharmacies, health care institutions and companies. They receive the daily ZIB in the form of an e-mail at night and usually read it in the morning. Or as Igor Vuk, Director of the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia's regional unit in Novogoriz, told us on the occasion of the 1000th issue: 'For some people, drinking coffee is their first and favourite morning task. For me, it's checking out your condensed health care and health insurance news."" An encouraging greeting and we wish it still applies. <p/> Question. <p/> Answer. For example, for the 1000th issue, we rewarded readers with a slightly redesigned page and made it possible to read the content in a single column, which makes it easier to read the bulletin on the screen. We then started to offer a Little ZIB in the mornings with a selection of media articles, which brings together selected media stories of the day and is a ""preview"" of the Media section of the forthcoming Bulletin, which will be published the following day. Ahead of the 2,000th issue, we have given readers direct access to public procurement documents and the Official Journal. And there will be more in the future. <p/> Question: Healthcare is often surrounded by affairs, which the media construct in different ways, from objective reporting to the presentation of less and more spicy facts or even interest-biased supplements. How do you bring the reporting of these affairs into the otherwise calm and sometimes even a little dignified ZIB? <p/> Answer. The editor is too much of a journalist to manage such a thing. It is made up of facts, respect and knowledge of the field of health and the people involved in it in a variety of ways. These three things - facts, the field and the people - are interwoven in complex patterns that are not always invented by individual people, but ripple through the times in which they are created. <p/> To put this into words, the ZIB editorial team consistently avoids using pejorative words and phrases in published articles. Very often, it is with bad language that affairs are glossed over in the media. They invite exotic reading as exotic exotica, obscuring or even distorting the essence of the actual phenomenon or event. And when you shake off the ""leaves"", what remains is what it is. Facts are not always pretty, and the problems we report on are not, as a rule, pretty. But if they are presented as they are, they are more likely to be solved or eliminated by those to whom they refer. <p/> Question: A particularly topical issue in healthcare at the moment - and one that ZIB has written about on several occasions - is that of information related to medicines, where there is a necessary, but not easily identifiable, boundary between information and advertising. Is it even definable? <p/> Answer: There is no precise boundary. There is good information in good advertising and there is bad information in bad advertising. The inner self can judge what is important, even in this respect. At Zib, we help ourselves by consistently citing the sources of information for each article. <p/> Question. <p/> Answer. Well, we have also made a little Zib advertising duck, with a yellow beak, inviting people to read information about what ZIB offers and who it is for.

763,"In shopping centres, preferably with separate entrances and exits and with floor signage <p/> Ahead of Monday's opening of shopping centres and activities in them, the NICE has made recommendations for both retailers and shoppers. Measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus will make shopping in large centres a little different from what shoppers were used to before the crisis. Among other things, the NIJZ advises separate entrances and exits and floor signage. <p/> In addition to the standard and general recommendations that apply across the board, such as frequent hand washing and disinfection, cough hygiene, appropriate distances and the like, the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) has made additional detailed recommendations ahead of Monday's resumption of activity in shopping centres. These apply not only to shops but also to the many other service providers and activities (repairs, repair services, book and paper shops, watchmakers, jewellers, key-making, etc.) located in these centres. The NIJH recommends that the maximum number of customers in a room should be adapted to the size of the room, taking into account a sufficient personal distance of at least 1.5 metres. In the common corridors of the shopping centre, it is necessary to prevent large numbers of people from loitering, and it is therefore advisable to use floor markings and guide posts with tapes to indicate the direction of movement, so that people do not move in the opposite direction at the same time. Care will also need to be taken to ensure that the stalls and other services available in the common corridors are properly positioned. Where possible, shopping centres should also provide for entry and exit through separate entrances and exits. The implementation of these measures should be supervised by security guards or authorised employees of the shopping centres. Retailers should also ensure that employees and customers are able to wash and disinfect their hands in the business premises, including by means of appropriate disinfectant dispensers. In addition to posters and infographics, warnings should also be given in shopping centres through regular audio messages or digital displays. Common seating and rest areas such as benches, massage chairs and seating in corridors will not be used, nor will common children's play areas. The NIJH also reminded people to ensure effective ventilation, especially with windows wide open, and to avoid air circulation with mechanical ventilation. Shoppers will also need to follow the recommendations before entering and staying in shopping centres: only healthy individuals without signs of respiratory infection should enter, while the elderly and patients with chronic non-communicable diseases at higher risk are advised to take extra protection or consider visiting the shopping centre as a matter of urgency. Hand disinfection before entering and repeatedly while in the building will be mandatory, especially when shopping in different stores, using escalators or lifts (stairs are preferable). They also advise minimising touching of any surfaces and objects, including displays, and going contactless when making payments.",News/Reporting,train

779,"Hotel Diana: Olga Belec wins in lawsuit between two female directors <p/> Court rejects Jasna Klepec's claim to annul the contract <p/> A ruling by the District Court in Murska Sobota has brought to an end a lawsuit in which Jasna Klepec, the owner of Hotel Diana, had sought to annul the contract by which she and her business partner Željko Jovanović bought a stake in the company from Olga Belec and her son Patrick Belec at the end of 2018. Luka Podjed, a Ljubljana-based lawyer who is defending Belč, says that the court expectedly rejected Klepč's claim and that it was, in his opinion, fundamentally unfounded. ""The court followed our arguments completely and found that there was no payment in cash. It also found that Klepčeva had obtained all the necessary information about the state of the company and the real estate, or had the opportunity to obtain it."" Klepčeva based her claim on allegations that Belčeva had not informed her of all the details of the company's business, including certain liabilities owed to employees, before signing the contract. The contract thus remains valid and, as previously reported, Hotel Diana has since ended up in bankruptcy. In addition to the annulment of the contract, Klepčeva's lawsuit also sought the reimbursement of the purchase price, claiming that it amounted to EUR 80 000 in total, although the contract, which was also notarised, stated an amount of EUR 30 000. <p/> Aleš Cipot <p/> Olga Belec <p/> Klepčeva claimed that, as agreed, on the day of the signing of the contract, 50 thousand euros were handed over to Belčeva in cash, allegedly by Matej Hofinger, a businessman from Velenje, who acted as an intermediary in the transaction, but they did not provide any evidence to convince the judge, Marjetica Škerget Logar, of their claims. Klepčeva says she is disappointed with the court's decision and will appeal it. Olga Belec welcomes the court's decision to the contrary, and believes that the allegations in the claim were fabricated. ""This proves what I have been saying all along, that the sale was transparent. I even went to help the new management for the first two months after the sale. I sold the company in good faith, because the buyers assured me that they would also buy the property, which I did not have enough money to do myself. So I was glad that someone who supposedly could save the company bought it, but if I had known that things would turn out this way, I would never have sold it to them."" As for the allegations of receiving cash, Belčeva reiterates that this never happened. She adds that she herself has thought a lot about how such allegations could have come about: ""I wonder whether Matej Hofinger might not have really received the money from Klepčeva, but gave it to someone else. In any case, the whole affair was about diverting attention to me, because I was State Secretary at the time, while the company was being financially drained.""",News/Reporting,train

817,"""The police, with their dedicated work in unenviable conditions, continue to prove that the almost impossible is still possible."" <p/> To commemorate the determined resistance of the militiamen and to protect our own country and our people, we police officers have chosen 27 June as our national day. Police Day is celebrated every year. This year's main ceremony, which commemorated the independence role of Slovenian militiamen, took place today, 27 June 2014, at the Police Academy. <p/> The ceremony was attended by the Police leadership, award recipients and distinguished guests, as well as by the families of fallen police officers who lost their lives in the war for the independence of Slovenia, and by police officers who were wounded at the time. <p/> Today, the Slovenian Police is celebrating more than twenty years of history. ""In all these years we have become a well-organised and efficient institution. But today, unfortunately, without modern equipment, without sufficient staff, in old vehicles and facilities, it is stagnant. /.../ Despite the fact that the police have been driven by the reserve for quite some time now, we have recorded good operational successes in the past period,"" said Stanislav Veniger, Director General of the Police, in his speech. <He added that ""we are living in a time when the demands of global security require us to move more decisively beyond the 'security in your own backyard' mentality. The world is getting smaller and smaller and borders are no longer impermeable. /.../ Fortunately, Slovenia is still considered a country with a high level of security. But security is not a given and it does not come for free. It takes a lot of hard work by dedicated, under-rewarded and stressed police officers. No one entered the police ranks with the idea of getting rich. But the motivation to work, derived solely from a sense of belonging and mission, is slowly losing its power. /.../ The police are certainly an important link in ensuring security, but they are not the only link. I am pleased to see that other authorities, also responsible for security, have begun to play their part more vigorously."" <p/> The Minister of the Interior, Dr Gregor Virant, also addressed the gathering. He said that today, twenty-three years after independence, we could say that Slovenians are more satisfied with our police than we are with our country in general. ""The police do not have the ups and downs of the state, but they are a bird in the sky. For many years it has enjoyed a high reputation among citizens, providing people with a sense of order, stability and security. Recently, more than before, it must be admitted, there is also a feeling that we are all really equal before the law. <p/> Today, the police are not afraid of anyone, but all those who have robbed the Slovenes and stolen Slovenia from them tremble before them. The police is a stable institution with tradition and quality leadership. As an expert on the state administration, I can say this. /.../ I have to say that one of the things that surprised me most positively was the extremely modern approach to governance and management. I have come to realise that there is, in fact, positive selection in the police in the choice of management staff. /.../ Modern methods of leadership and management, the introduction of good practices, the elimination of bureaucratic matters within the system, the establishment of smart performance indicators. These are all successes of which any organisation can be proud. Therefore, the leadership of the police force deserves a lot of respect and thanks for leading the police in the right direction. But leaders cannot achieve their goals without capable and dedicated colleagues, and the credit for the success of the police goes to every police officer who puts in the effort and achieves the expected results. So congratulations to all of you."" <p/> This year we are celebrating 10 years of cooperation in Europol, and the Ljubljana Mounted Police Station, which we recently celebrated, is celebrating its anniversary. For the 66th year, the Police Orchestra has been delighting us with its delicate sound. Under the baton of Tomaž Kmetič, it once again enriched our ceremony. <p/> At ceremonies held throughout the country these days, meritorious police employees are awarded in their respective police units for their contribution to the promotion of safety culture and for their merits and contribution to the development and strengthening of safety, and individuals from other countries and other organisations are presented with police badges of cooperation. The highest police awards were presented at today's ceremony by the Minister of the Interior, Dr Gregor Virant, and the Director General of the Police, Stanislav Veniger. <p/> The Golden Police Cooperation Badge was awarded to Josef Erhard of the German Police for excellent cooperation in the field of car crime over many years and to the Slovenian Armed Forces for excellent cooperation over many years, which undoubtedly makes an important contribution to the readiness to carry out the operational tasks of the police. The award was received by the Chief of the General Staff of the Slovenian Armed Forces, Major General Dobran Božič. <p/> The Golden Police Shield was awarded to Martin Poharc from the Celje Police Directorate, Dean Jurič from the Koper Police Directorate and Vojko Rupnik from the Kranj Police Directorate. <p/> The Grand Shield of the Police with a Bronze Star was awarded to Marjan Anzeljc from the Police Specialities Administration, Simon Velički, Director of the Kranj Police Directorate and Mag. Stanislav Vrečar, Director of the Ljubljana Police Directorate. <p/> The Grand Shield of the Police with the Silver Star was awarded to Andrej Rupnik from the Office of the Director General of the Police. <p/> The Great Shield of the Police with a gold star was awarded to the Special Police Unit of the General Police Directorate, on whose behalf the award was accepted by its Commander Rado Abutovič, <p/> while the highest award of the Police, a firearm, was awarded to Franc Sablič, Director of the National Forensic Laboratory. <p/> We would like to congratulate all the award winners for their outstanding contribution to the safety of citizens and the reputation of the Slovenian Police. <p/> Today was also the Police Open Day, where we prepared an attractive presentation of the Slovenian Police for all participants and visitors. There was great enthusiasm for the passing parade of mounted police officers and their noble assistants, as well as for the demonstration of helicopter rescue, such as that carried out on many occasions by the crews of the Air Police Unit, who took part in the rescue of people in the recent floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a police helicopter. <p/> Later, it was possible to see up close what a police helicopter looks like, as well as how a crime scene investigation van is equipped, and what the so-called ""blinda"", which is used to transport protected persons, looks like. We also displayed a mobile police station and a Schengen bus, as well as a speed enforcement vehicle on the motorway, the so-called provido. <p/> The children were particularly interested in the equipment of the police officers of the Special Police Unit. They were fascinated by their helmets, shields and attractive stories from the protection of various public events. <p/> The younger visitors, in particular, were most excited to see the motorcycle police officers and to take photos on their white and blue motorcycles, as well as the police service dog handlers with their trained four-legged friends, and the mascot of Constable Leon.",News/Reporting,train

830,"Ordinary Woman (Written by Danaja Lorenčič) <p/> In the eyes of ten year old, twenty year old and even thirty year old Danaja, I was burned at the stake in my quest to become something special. <p/> Danaja Lorenčič <p/> A few weeks ago, I was invited for coffee by a friend I rarely see. But while talking to her, I immediately got that familiar feeling that reminds me again and again why I love some people so much. Because they don't hide behind a mask of perfection, they don't feel ashamed of their vulnerability, they don't get defensive when they are in need, and they don't resort to cynicism when you touch their wounds during a conversation. <p/> Before we had each had our cup of coffee, she told me that she had been searching for her own identity lately, as she had lost herself in the last few years due to her many roles. She was starting to wonder who she was if she wasn't a mother and a wife who went to work and in her spare time was a musician. It touched me when she confessed that one of her greatest fears was to become an ordinary woman, so she kept up her hobbies, even when she no longer enjoyed them, because she was afraid that without them she would slip into a boring routine and turn into an uninteresting person. How I recognised myself in her words! I don't have any hobbies, because I have turned what I enjoy most into my work (i.e. writing), but I identified with her fear of the ordinary. Suddenly, hundreds of scenes swirled in my head, reminding me of all I had done to escape the image of the ordinary woman I feared almost as much as my own death. <p/> To avoid becoming ordinary, I kept my weight low and for a short time even believed that anorexia made me special. To avoid becoming ordinary, I rejected the idea of a serious relationship for years because I thought that being single was something that only independent, strong women could do. To avoid becoming ordinary, I dreamt for a very, very long time of a singing career that would save me from an ordinary life, paying bills and annoying bosses. To avoid becoming ordinary, I hung out with damaged people who, like me, refused to grow up for a long time. To avoid becoming ordinary, I gave up my first and only regular job. To avoid becoming ordinary, I gave up any thought of motherhood by the age of thirty-five. <p/> Of all the things I did to escape from ordinariness, there is only one thing I do not regret - that I gave up a job that did not make me the least bit happy. Which is not to say that I was entirely happy about it afterwards, as I swallowed the bitter experience of precarious work. But I took responsibility for that decision and faced it. Because by giving up a secure job, I was not running away from discomfort, I was throwing myself out of my comfort zone and starting to develop my potential within my discomfort zone. <p/> This made me feel special, and I tried to escape the fate of the ordinary woman in other areas of my life. I decided that I wanted to write for a living and convinced myself that this was only possible if I didn't have a partner to start a family with, as this would certainly hinder me from achieving my goals. I was operating under the mindset: If I want to be special, I have to give up what is typical of most people. <p/> In reality, I was scared of love after the love wrecks that had caused me emotional wounds. I was scared to let go of control of my weight because I thought I would lose control of my life. I was afraid to end destructive relationships with people who hated themselves because I was afraid they would hate me too. And I was terrified of becoming a mother - especially if I gave birth to a baby girl, because I knew that I would be a bad role model for her because of my unprocessed pain, my denial of pleasure, my tendency to abuse myself and to repress my emotions. <p/> If I take a closer look at my life, which is something of a ritual for me this week as I celebrate my 38th birthday, it is certainly different and in some ways much less special than I imagined it would be. <p/> For me, being special meant creating a life that did not involve complicated emotions, arguments, sharing household responsibilities with a partner and parenthood. <p/> Hearing my friend say that she was afraid of being ordinary made me think about how I had misinterpreted specialness and at the same time had an unjustified fear of being ordinary. Because back then, when I was striving for specialness, I was nowhere near as content and at peace as I am now. <p/> If I take a closer look at my life, which for me is a kind of obligatory ritual this week as I celebrate my 38th birthday, it is certainly different and in some ways much less special than I imagined it would be. I am no longer obsessed with controlling my weight. I have not become a famous singer or a successful writer. I have not stayed single so that I can create uninterrupted. I do not have many friends, because I have distanced myself from those who used to burden me with their darkness. And I did not give up motherhood so that I did not have to change anything about myself that I was not proud of. <p/> In the eyes of ten-year-old, twenty-year-old and even thirty-year-old Danaja, I was burnt out in my efforts to become something special. But in the eyes of Danaja, who is slowly approaching forty, I see peace. <p/> And that is what I have longed for for years. For an inner peace that I have wrongly called an ordinary life.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
831,"Events -> 2013 -> Parish Pilgrimage to Sladka Gora <p/> This year's pilgrimage route took us to Sladka Gora. <p/> A pilgrimage is a journey to the Lord, a walk on the stairs, increasing with each step the longing to touch the Heart and to rest in the Embrace. The soul is freed from the countless layers that bind and suffocate it, which is why the preparation for the Sacrament of Reconciliation is always so good for it. Ready to meet the Lord, we celebrated Holy Mass in the beautiful Baroque pilgrimage church of the Mother of God in Sladka Gora, Styria, with a men's choir made up of pilgrims singing. <p/> We were not only moved by the beautiful interior of the church, but also by the address of Pastor Andrew, who invited us to open our hearts to the point where we could ""be here"" with our whole being, soul and body, experiencing and fully accepting all that was placed before us; to forge bonds and friendships with people and with God. After the Holy Mass, the local parish priest gave us a historical outline of the Shrine and the life connected with it. <p/> The garden in front of the church was quite lively as the Oratory was taking place. <p/> We gathered again on the bus that took us to Šmarje pri Jelšah, where a good lunch was waiting for us. <p/> After lunch we went up to Calvary. The Way of Suffering, which leads to the pilgrimage church of St. Roko, is considered to be the most extensive Passion complex in Slovenia. It was built between 1743 and 1753. It leads the pilgrim between the chapels, so that he can always see only his next destination. Looking down into the valley, one sees the town and the unique image of the varied wine-growing landscape, from the border mountains of Styria and Carinthia to Pohorje, Boč and Donat, Macel and Zagorje in Croatia, to Bohorje, Hume and the Savinja Valley. <p/> Entering the Church of St. Roko, we had a new surprise. The massive exterior of the church, built in 1646, is in stark contrast to its richly decorated interior, where shell and net shapes, angel heads and flower branches intertwine. The pilgrimage tradition is still alive at St. Roch. On 15 August, the feast of the patron saint of the parish, Our Lady of the Assumption, and on 16 August, the feast of St. Rocco, several thousand people gather here. St. Rok is part of the pilgrimage triad, Sladka Gora - Tin Tin - St. Rok. The church is very acoustic, which is why concerts are held there. <p/> The first raindrops fell, and the bus took us to the most beautifully landscaped village in Europe, Olimje. <p/> Here we visited the Minorite monastery and learned about its history. <p/> In the Old Pharmacy we admired the frescoes by Anton Lerchinger, which speak of the path to health and happiness. We wandered into a shop with herbal preparations, teas, tinctures and ointments that help maintain health. We were overwhelmed by the image of the Pilgrimage House of St. Joseph and the park for rest and relaxation. We walked through the garden of medicinal plants where ""for every disease there is a flower"". The walking path leads between beds with around 200 specimens of medicinal plants named with Slovenian and Latin names, which grow in our gardens, meadows, marshes and forests, and are used for teas, salves and tinctures. Each plant is also labelled with its medicinal properties. <p/> In Olimje, we couldn't pass by the Chocolate Factory and its delicacies. We were drawn in, our eyes were big and our sweet tooth was irrepressible! <p/> At the end of our pilgrimage, in the beautiful Baroque pilgrimage church of the Assumption with its black and gold altars, we prayed the fifth Litany of the Mother of God and celebrated the National Day with a cultural programme in the courtyard of the monastery. <p/> On our way home, we passed through Trojany. Here we had a delicious doughnut or ice cream. We were happy and satisfied on our way back home, grateful to Pastor Andrew for leading and organising a wonderful pilgrimage that filled our hearts and souls. <p/> JP <p/> Photos.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

I really feel great here, the organisers take care of everything we need. That's the reason I keep coming back, I feel at home'', said the Czech tennis ace after his hard-fought victory. He could have saved the opening set in his favour when he served at 5-4, but Dimitrov had other plans. The Bulgarian stole a set from the Czech by winning four games in a row. Berdych did not make the same mistake in the second and third sets and took the break advantage safely to the end. <p/> ''I lost the opening set because Dimitrov played unbelievable. I was very happy with my serve in the second set, which helped me to finish well,'' explained the Czech. <p/> Tomas Berdych celebrates his second win in Stochholm and 10th of his career <p/> Grigor Dimitrov lost today, but is still in contention for the final in London. He is currently 11th in the ATP Race Rankings, 330 points behind Murray, who is still in eighth place, which is still enough to qualify. All credit to Tomas, it's tough after losing the final, but he was better'', said the Bulgarian, who will play in Basel next week, while Berdych will travel to Valencia.",News/Reporting,train

839,"Home - Ski Jumping - News - Everything is ready for the 2020/21 season grand final in Planica <p/> Everything is ready for the 2020/21 season grand final in Planica <p/> 17.03.2021 <p/> Ahead of the Ski Jumping World Cup season finale, which will take place at the Goriška Brothers Aerodrome next week, the representatives of OK Planica have summarised their thoughts and views. <p/> Enzo Smrekar, President of SZS and President of OK Planica <p/> After three successful World Championships in Slovenia and after all three World Cup competitions, we are now looking forward to the end of the season with the final in Planica. We are expecting all the teams, a great finish and a top organisation. Unfortunately, there will be no spectators again, hopefully for the last time. What is important is that we are working hard to partially cover the loss from the cancelled race last March. The expectation is that this event will also work with a positive zero and will partly contribute to covering the seasonal shortfall. <p/> I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all our loyal sponsors. Without them, it would not have been possible. Thanks also to all the workers and staff who work with great enthusiasm to ensure that our matches are held to a high standard. And of course, thanks to OK Planica, which oversees all of this and takes care of the event itself. I am sure that the media and all the teams will feel welcome, even though the precautions are strict. They are dictated by the profession on the one hand and by the precaution that has marked us this year as one of the top World Cup race organisers where there have never been any infections or cancellations. <p/> As we were wrapping up the World Championships in December, our minds were already somewhat on the World Cup in March. At that time, we imagined that we would now be able to welcome the first live spectators in the valley below Ponce. Unfortunately, even after all these months, and especially after the intense discussions in recent weeks, we can only conclude with sadness that we will not be welcoming spectators this year either, and that the measures that were in place in December are still in force. This means that everyone taking part in this competition will be staying in a so-called snow hut. Two areas will be set up, the so-called green area and the grey area. Protected areas in which the competition will run as smoothly as possible. The media regime will be similar to that in December. It applies both to work in the media centre and in the mixed zone. <p/> We have also worked quite a lot on the idea, which was already alive in December, of spectators watching the Alpine Skiing Competition from vehicles. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm this here today either. Not only the large amounts of snow we have received this winter, but also the epidemiological situation in Slovenia and in wider Europe is not yet good enough to make this possible. With our loyal sponsor, Zavarovalnica Triglav, we have once again prepared the so-called virtual fan stand, which will be located at the exit of the Goriška Brothers Airport. There, virtual spectators will be able to tune in to the competition itself via a remote meeting tool. I would already like to invite all interested parties to register on the triglav.si/planica website. There they will then wait for the call to watch the match. <p/> Planica will be different from everything we have already tried in December. These experiences have been very rewarding. The regime will be similar, but we learned a few things then. Despite the stricter requirement in Slovenian law that all participants in sporting events must be tested every 48 hours, we will stick to it. The extra day of competition makes the risk of infection even greater. We do not want this to happen at the start of the season. We want to maintain our reputation as a good, excellent organiser and that is why this decision has been taken. The rules for World Cup ski jumping competitions in the FIS family are slightly different and in some points even stricter than we are used to elsewhere. <p/> At the moment we have 16 teams registered. Approximately 186 people are on the accreditation list. Access to the valley will be restricted from this weekend. Initially there will be a partial restriction, but from Monday onwards the valley will be virtually closed to all outside visitors. Access will be restricted to accredited persons only. <p/> Preventive measures against covid-19 remain in place. Call for distance, wearing FFP2 masks at all times and disinfection! This is absolutely in place. Please adhere to it, everyone. <p/> As a point of interest, if we hosted the games under floodlights in December, the games during the week will be held in the afternoon, but still in daylight conditions. And with TV Slovenia's TV coverage, we will once again provide additional attractive spots, so this time the coverage from Planica will also be something special. I can say that I have a proof copy of the book that will be published on the occasion of this year's Plania competition. I am sure it will be very well received by everyone. The Goriška brothers are fatally linked to Planica and Planica to them. This is one more moment of this year's Planica. <p/> The budget this time is a few euros short of EUR 1.5 million. If we compare this with the classic finals in previous years, it is as much as half as much. We have had to work very hard to turn every euro around and spend it as economically as possible so that the final calculation shows a positive zero. Unfortunately, the absence of spectators has resulted in a loss of approximately 35% of revenue. If we add to this the loss made last March, the situation is not enviable, but it is not unmanageable. We and our team at OK Planica will do our utmost to successfully eliminate this loss. In addition to our loyal sponsors, who have stood by us all these years, I would like to thank the Ministry of Defence, the Slovenian Armed Forces and, of course, the Slovenian Police, who, with their members, always make sure that Planica is as it is, as we are used to it, and I believe that it will be special this time too, although it will be different, because the spectators will not be able to come to the valley below Ponce. <p/> Aljoša Dolhar, Competition Manager <p/> I feel a certain amount of responsibility. This year, from the very beginning, the preparations have been a bit different than usual. We had a specific situation and we had three types of snow on the airfield. We had about 4000 cubic metres of snow left over from the March event, which we stored and then used in December. A lot of natural snow fell on top of that. We estimate the quantity to be around 12 000 cubic metres. In addition, we produced about 5,000 cubic metres of artificial snow. During the winter races, in cooperation with NC Planica, we kept the ski jump and the run-off area tamped, the snow compacted, mixed and, above all, prevented from sliding. On the downhill run, we also kept the ski from December. Only this one had to be cleaned and re-cut. The situation at the moment is such that today we have started removing the spare snow that we had stored in the run-out. We are spreading the snow on the runway with a tamping machine. We have the skis practically ready, so we are just waiting to open them and start using them. We will be ready with the machine work on Friday afternoon. We are planning a big operation on Saturday and Sunday with our team to get everything ready for the test on Tuesday. <p/> Today and tomorrow in Planica there are optional training sessions for the pre-competitors. After tomorrow we will form a team of 20-25 jumpers who will jump next week. On Tuesday at 15:30 we expect the first series of the aerodrome test. The second series is planned for 17:00, so that we can test the visibility and conditions at the same time. As far as the weather forecast is concerned, I have to say that it is quite favourable at the moment. From Tuesday onwards we expect stable weather, with moderate temperatures. At night it will be -5 to -8, which will make our work easier. Daytime temperatures will range from 2 to 8 degrees. The weather will be partly clear to mainly cloudy, which is better than very clear. I hope this forecast is accurate. Wind conditions should also be very stable. The weather is also very good for us at the moment. Who will jump first will be known after tomorrow's practice. <p/> This year in Planica the whole jury of the competition will change, not only the competition director. There is also a change of TD and ATD. We will see what this means on Sunday after the competition. The Technical Delegate will be Ivo Greger from the Czech Republic, who I understand has no experience with flying, but is an experienced TD. His assistant is my assistant on the flights, Thomas Hasselberger from Germany. We have worked well together at all the airshows and I hope that this will make a difference and that we will work harmoniously as a jury.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

851,"I had this operation this week. I wonder if anyone has any experience. How about cycling, after how long did you go back on the bike, I mean on a single, in the woods, not on the asphalt. Thank you lp hema <p/> Obey the doctor's advice. A lot also depends on each individual, some people heal faster, some slower with various complications. Definitely consult a doctor, but it is true that sometimes they exaggerate the time limit until when you should avoid exertion etc...but all this for your prevention... <p/> Thank you. I have a very good doctor and I will listen to him. But I am more of the get back on my feet quickly sort. We'll see. lp, hema <p/> I had this operation too. First I gritted my teeth in pain for two years, went round and round the docs, waited months for check-ups, was prescribed therapy in the acute phase, lost my job because of sick leave, waited for the disability committee to give me an opinion because of my paralysed leg, was hit by trampolines, rolled around the hospitals and received blockades, when finally they took pity on me and operated. Unfortunately, it was too late - the result is the destruction of the sciatic nerve from the spine to the end of the feet.I can't feel my left leg because of paresis, or I have the feeling of a ""deaf"" leg. The muscles have slowly atrophied and there is clearly no strength in the leg. I cannot wear a minica. My fendered foot bothers me a lot on the bike, I have no power, I can't get off on the left side because I fall, on the special I have a spd in the middle of the shoe because there is no power in the foot, and I can push the pedal with my whole foot (thank you Stan for redoing my shoe).Clearly, my kneecaps and leggings are constantly creeping down, because my foot is 5 digits smaller than the right one (the right one). It also bothers me a lot in cross-country skiing and dry running because with this wedge foot I have no push-off and it makes me kneel. I also have a limp, but it is not noticeable when dancing. The doctors immediately warned me that this tends to happen again. Well, it hasn't happened to me yet. Nevertheless, I ride a bicycle. I already had a bike with me in the spa after the operation and it was even recommended. Nevertheless, I ride on rough terrain, and sometimes I fall because I get sucked onto the wrong side and cannot catch my foot. I also find it difficult to carry a 15-kilogram bike, but it goes with a yoke. I also go to marathons (not yet disabled) cycling and running and I do have worse results, but I can do it. Even the sledging punctures haven't knocked me out yet. Even the stitched rags I wear at -12 degrees C can't get to me yet. I have spent a lot of money and time on various chiropractic and electrotherapy treatments to restore the nerve, but the neurologists have put me on solid ground - it's a lifetime. My therapy, my pleasure, is the bicycle. I advise you to do the same. But I hope you don't have any consequences-a destroyed nerve, because then there is no problem at all-get on the bike as soon as possible. <p/> Andreja, thank you, really thank you for these words. No, fortunately I went to a specialist (self-pay) after two months of pain and injections, and he immediately put me on a CT scan in Jesenice, and after 20 days it was my turn for the operation. So, I don't have the same consequences as you. But I know that my leg hasn't worked for a while and it will need to be woken up a bit, but exercises and walks and spa will do. Today is exactly 14 days after the operation and I am more and more hopeful that Franja will not escape me this year. If I may ask you this: Which spa have you been to and how is the bike- where did you put it? Thank you again, you really gave me the mood. LP, hema <p/> I was in Dobrna twice for 14 days each, staying in an old villa opposite the Health Resort. They had a ""rumpr kamra"", where I had my bike, a trekking bike at that time. It was not a treatment but a real relaxing holiday - therapies in the morning, walks in the afternoon, cycling around Paško Kozjak, around Šmartinsko Lake, swimming in the evening, playing cards with my friends.... <p/> Greetings! It's been three months since the operation and I don't have any major problems on the bike, in fact I'm still cycling the easiest, avoiding some hard downhills a bit. I don't have any problems with climbing due to hernia problems (I have them due to the kg gained during 4 months of total inactivity ) hema <p/> With back problems you need to spend a lot of time strengthening the abdominal muscles. And it's also good to keep them as tight as possible while driving. This is where endurance comes into play... <p/> Thank you, Little Mother! I'm working on it, my friend said that if I don't rest (I have to lie down for at least a couple of days, and sit as little as possible), he'll take me back to Jesenice. <p/> Why a second operation? I join Matičko's wishes. <p/> Depression thank you! The first time everything was ok. The second operation is on the other vertebra, or disc-my other leg was hurting, which looked a bit ""strange"" the first time, and has now developed to the point that I had to have ""sub-urgent"" surgery (from MRI to surgery in three days). Lp <p/> hmm; difficulty getting up after sitting; feeling ""electric shakes"" in one leg (along a nerve across the arse); walking, cycling etc. no problems; is that it? - will my aunt's hernia visit me? <p/>Miscolin, it could be something like that. I recommend you see an orthopaedic surgeon, because if it is not too bad you can cure it with exercises and massage. It's good to be examined by a specialist... Just don't wait too long because the operation is not pleasant. I went to an orthopaedic surgeon (in Kranj, he's really a master) because it's too long to wait. If you are interested in more, you can PM me <p/> To join the ""hernia club"" After a day's hiking, I got a low back pain. It wasn't entirely without foreshadowing, I felt a slight draft in my lumbar area right at the start of the tour. After the first long stop I found it a bit hard to get up but decided to continue. After 5 h of cycling I felt neither stiffness nor pain. I thought it was a happy ending. Unfortunately it was not. When I cooled down I was stiff in the lower back and the pain was spreading from the lower back all over my right leg. I was in pain for two weeks. A CT scan showed a herniated L5 disc. I decided to get it sorted as soon as possible so I am now in therapy. There is probably someone else with similar problems. I would be interested to know if anyone has resolved the pain without surgery. Of course, I am most interested in how it works on the bike. Does anyone use cosmodisk active on the bike to prevent back problems ? <p/> Just a layman's thought: maybe a good chiropractor could help you?If the injury is not too serious, of course, they don't do miracles anyway. Marko <p/> My mother was helped a lot by ""stretching"" her spine, if that's what you call it. She bought a special stand with a table on it. You lie down on the table, pin your legs together and turn the table ""upside down"" so that you are lying upside down.... 5-10 min 2x a day. She bought this table from an Austrian company... it's a medical device, so it's tried and tested. The result of using it is that the vertebrae gradually ""stretch"" by about a millimetre, thus relieving the pressure on the nerves. LP <p/> Well, after 4h months of regular exercise, the problems are gone; and the weight is off <p/> I hope for a similar result with both pain and weight <p/> The stretching table as Yogo wrote certainly helps. Otherwise, a beginner's Yoga class (1-2) does wonders. But it depends on your condition. Also, a chiropractor can do more harm if the condition is very bad. Start carefully. I don't doubt it, though, because you've already tasted the pain. <p/> that's it... the price is admittedly reasonable for a ""medical device"" but it's forever... the spine isn't <p/> ...a few days ago on a climbing trip I heard the story of an elderly gentleman who was put in a wheelchair by the doctors a short time later - he was already walking with great difficulty, his trunk movement was very limited, etc. The gentleman was an occasional climber, which he was advised against, like any other harder or extreme sport. His soul would not rest and he went climbing a few times. The catch was that the day after climbing, the movement was much better and the pain was less. He also noticed that the pills/hypnotics and other things ""helped"" him much less than climbing - now he tries to climb as much as possible, so in his old age he also enrolled in a mountaineering course and combines the enjoyable with the very useful for himself! There is something, or a lot, in stretching the spine. I had a lot of problems myself, the doctors couldn't find a solution, I was too young to be advised to have surgery, I was saved by a chiropractor (for a short time). Now I do more sports, I look a little more at my diet and it is much better. For the last two months I have done very little sport because of colds, flu and poisoning, I haven't swum at all, I haven't cycled, I've only climbed a few times... the problems are coming back!!! Stretching, yoga, sports that relax the spine help in my opinion... and it's even more ""fun"" than an operation! (all written here is my experience or the experience of my interlocutors) <p/> In my opinion, besides the stretching of the spine, the fact that playing sports moves the muscles that support the spine is also a big factor here. Marko <p/> I agree! That's my opinion too, but somehow I forgot to mention... <p/> Thanks for all the tips. The stretching table was suggested to me by a yogi a week or so ago and the stuff should be able to help. The problem is that I live in a block of flats and have limited space. Ever since yogo suggested it I have been thinking about what to throw out of the flat to make room for a table. Today I am on my fourth day of therapy and I have to admit that I have gained flexibility and I don't feel pain anymore. <p/> problematiks wrote:I really don't know what the problem is here.Bos did go to visit his mother, didn't he? Marko <p/> He had problems. 2x. The first time I got dirty with one of the exercises from aktivni.si, and when it was over, and the exercises were over, I got cut again. This time worse. I found some other exercises on the net that are a bit of a stretch, a bit for strength, ..., but from the beginning the dogs hurt, but it got better quickly. Now I do them occasionally, and sometimes (not during the exercises) I feel my back, but no problems. I can cycle, walk, ski, but it hurts when I swim or run (I get more discomfort, but I'd better stop) or carry heavier things (say, a bundle of raden in one hand). Lifting is not a problem. The injury occurs between the ages of 25 and 40 in about 90% of the population. The sheath is already hard, but the inside is still soft. Because of weak small spinal muscles, the spine collapses, and a ""bulge"" forms on the disc, which presses on the nerve. These muscles can only be trained with specific exercises, Kegels are very effective, and there are many on the net. I've put these in a pdf, if anyone wants it I'll mail it to them. Maybe it helps someone else, it helped me. http://www.aktivni.si/zdravje/sedite-na ... ani-bombi/",Forum,train
852,"About the book and the author(s) <p/> The novel interweaves (through the lens of a fictional writer) three stories derived from three autobiographical accounts: the story of a great archaeologist (Heinrich Schliemann), the story of an adventure novelist (Karl May), and the story of a counter-intelligence chief in an ""unnamed country"", set in the second half of the 20th century. The basic link between the narratives is the writer's reflection on the falsity or truthfulness of autobiographies. <p/> The narrative of the counter-intelligence officer is in prose, the individual parts of the archaeologist's story are in verse (hexameter, elegiac distich), and the story of Karl Mayo is accompanied as a theatrical performance. This mixing of genres is inspired, at least in formal terms, by the novels of the Enlightenment (Diderot, Sterne). The work is thus situated in the tradition of the modern novel in the context of world literature, the beginning of which most literary historians place at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries. <p/> The experimentalism of the Enlightenment novel, rediscovered by postmodernism, is realised in In Their Own Words above all as a play with the expressive possibilities of autobiographical writing. (Autobiographicalism is currently, both in Slovenia and worldwide, one of the most topical themes for both creators and researchers of fiction.) In terms of content, the work is open to the outside, but at the same time - through the figure of the writer, as well as through the presence of the implicit reader - it is closely embedded in the Slovenian space. <p/> Katarina Marinčič <p/> Slovenian writer, 1968 <p/> Katarina Marinčič is well known to Slovenian readers, having published three novels, Tereza (1989), Rožni vrt (1992) and Prikrita harmonija (2001), as well as a collection of novellas, O treh (2005). She received the Kresnik Prize (2002) for her novel Prikrita harmonija / Hidden Harmony and the Dnevnik Fable Prize (2007) for her collection O treh / About Three. In 2015, her novel After Their Words earned her a nomination for the K kresnik and the Critics' Sieve Award. <p/> The writer's second - or parallel - profession is also related to literature. She teaches 18th and 19th century French literature at the Faculty of Arts in Ljubljana, where she completed her PhD with a dissertation on the work of Honoré de Balzac.",Information/Explanation,train
854,"Text taken from the novel Three Reasons, page 220. The computer displays images inaudibly and lights flash on the titanium case. Where the light burns long at night, there are ideas. And that, we know, is wrong, heretical ... and dangerous ... <p/> There are no powerful plots in the novel, and it is nothing like The Da Vinci Code, I say to those who, like the writer, had trouble with that book and barely made it to the end. There is a chronological account of the various events in The Three Reasons. It is more like this. And in fact, in film, if you like, and literature, there are few things as dramatic as real life. Even though we all know life, it still tells us something new and special every day. And it is always more interesting to write about. The novel Three Reasons is a humorous slice of a year in the life of a mother of two Lilliputians, a wife and an interesting young woman. <p/> The story introduces different people through a first-person narrative (Xenia's). The negative Vlasta, the careerist Darja, the smeared Nika and the unhappy Veronika, Xenia's family and a wider circle of acquaintances through whom she paints her unusual images. Unlike many other authors, she takes refuge in reality at critical points, or so I understood her. This is very unusual. The author does not come across as naïve at all, I would rather say fresh and youthful. Despite her experience, she has, in my opinion, almost too much confidence in her environment and in other people. How damn wrong she is, she is yet to find out. Her whole generation will find that out. There can be no doubt about that. She is only distrustful of her partner, who probably of all people loves and respects her the most. That does not surprise me one bit. All the women I know are like that. <p/> Without a single exception. :) <p/> There is humour in Three Reasons, too. Good and beautifully written. We can laugh at Alexandra in many places. I found myself laughing the most when she describes the passionate lovemaking where Xenia and Marko have earned their butts on their heads on the same shelf. They switched positions, there is no doubt about that. Whether it was when her phone fell into a puddle or when she met her boyfriend from the machine. <p/> This is how she describes her weighing and makes fun of the fashion commandments. With the rarely seen self-irony of a woman with a slightly damaged self-esteem, which at the end very smoothly turns into a sympathetic sarcasm: <p/> I stripped naked to make the result as accurate as possible. I went to pee earlier, so that I wouldn't suffer at the expense of a few unnecessary grams. And then the fatal step. The thin plate seemed to be groaning under my weight. I blinked, told myself once again that the result didn't matter because I'd fix it soon anyway, then opened my eyes and looked down. 69 kilos. The dreaded seven was damn close. My stomach clenched, I immediately got down and then stepped on the scales again. Don't ever do that unless you're too skinny! I jumped down like I'd been burnt by nettles and resisted the instinctive urge to try again - maybe the result would be more normal after all, like a cute 62. It was clear that the scale was sensing my torment and deliberately adding salt to my tired bones. <p/> Through self-irony, she also makes a rueful mockery of a world in which Barbies are the ideal of feminine beauty, and things like that. <p/> Those Barbies you can talk to like you can talk to the telly ... :) <p/> 3. <p/> Language is special. It's self-described and not inspired by anyone. It's a little bit like Gosposvetsko polje, it's just more modern and quite unusual. It is apparent that Aleksandra also writes poetry, quite well, in the opinion of those in the know, to put it casually. The language is innovative in describing contemporary things and interspersed with less familiar words for decoration and delicacy. Sometimes even too much, even with paediatric and other medical terms. I did not understand it yet, but I studied medicine. Don't believe me? I really did, only that was a long time ago, when I was in the seventh grade of an eight-year school. Even then I was very talented, although not much appreciated, and only one classmate had any understanding for my studies. I read the medical encyclopaedia, all the entries on A and B. And I had the symptoms of all those diseases. Except for white current, or I didn't know how to recognise it in the first year. So I dropped out of that study. For health reasons, mostly. :) The structure of the text itself is also quite strange. The beginning and the end of the novel are symmetrical, the same words are repeated. The mantra of the three reasons appears throughout the text, which is why it's like a kind of theme or a literary musical theme. There are other structural and stylistic elements, but they are not the most essential for an amateur's experience and understanding of the content. That is why I leave them to the experts, so that they have something to write about. <p/> It is quite a good text. Will it win any prizes? I am thinking. Hardly. Just because it is written by a young woman, it doesn't stand much of a chance. Although ... Still, there's something going on with these awards. Something heretical. Something they're stirring up over there now, bossing and changing. That's good. At least that's what I was thinking on the Rožnik, listening to the cute Combine singing a song. The lyrics were written by Moss, in case you didn't know. That Vojnović gets more votes than Jančar? That is something! For Vojnović, of course. A little less for Jančar. That is heretical and different from what it was. So that the faces in the boxes sometimes get mixed up. That is also the point. To have something fresh for the daily news and not just last year's news. I have not read these two books to this day. I have no time. Except for a little bit in the sublist. If anything, I prefer to read Lainsztek and Mazzini. Or poetry, if I don't have anything more clever to do. <p/> For all these reasons, I hope that Alexandra has a chance with Three Reasons. She could do with some kind of prize, probably more than the aforementioned authors. And no one would be too much of a fool. They wouldn't have anything to bullshit about, at least in my opinion. There are more than three reasons for that, too. And her thirtieth anniversary is coming up soon, because she's in quite a hurry. Already at the age of four ... :) <p/> I would also like to draw attention to a particular atmosphere that emanates from the text. It seems Bulgakovian to me, although I can't explain it very well. There are no communist apparatchiks, and nobody's head is cut off by a tram. But there is something there, if not I would not feel it. Only, I cannot say it very well, because I am just a lover of literature and I am writing my opinion here mainly for you to pick up the book. <p/> That is all it is really about.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
855,"Šarec happy with proposal for EU top jobs <p/> Prime Minister Marjan Šarec, arriving at an extraordinary EU summit, said the proposal circulating on the distribution of top jobs was not bad. <p/> Reuters <p/> Marjan Šarec says the proposal he has seen is not bad. <p/> The scenario circulating unofficially is that socialist Frans Timmermans would become president of the European Commission. ""He is certainly a good candidate,"" Marjan Šarec said when asked whether the Dutchman was acceptable to Slovenia. <p/> ""We have now seen a proposal. For me it is not a bad proposal. Even if that were the case, it is a pretty good proposal,"" the prime minister said. But when asked more specific questions, he replied only that it was difficult to describe the details when arriving at the summit. <p/> The proposal was agreed in Osaka, on the sidelines of the G20 summit <p/> An unofficial scenario is circulating that the post of President of the European Commission would go to the Socialists, the post of President of the European Parliament and the high-level foreign policy post to the centre-right European People's Party (EPP), and the post of President of the European Council to the Liberals. <p/> ""They say they have agreed something in Japan. Now, when we sit down, we will see how it goes, and then we will move on. It is difficult for me to say much right now, I can only express the hope that there will be an agreement today or overnight so that the process can move forward and there will not be too long a deadlock,"" Šarec said of the proposal in play. <p/> The Liberals getting the post of President of the European Council seems good to the Slovenian Prime Minister. He did not want to talk about the names, saying that they must first sit down at the table. He also refused to comment on who his favourite or favourite candidate was and whether the Danish Liberal Margrethe Vestager, whom he has so far supported for the Commission presidency, was still in the running. <p/> ""Now we need to hear proposals. I cannot say anything until I am inside and until I see if anything new has happened in the meantime. It's been an hour and a half, something may have changed in that time,"" he said. <p/> Šarec hopes that there will be no blockages, recalling that decision-making does not require pure consensus and that even five years ago not everyone supported the then candidate Jean-Claude Juncker. He feels that it would be good to reach a compromise to some extent, but if this is not possible, then it must be decided by a majority. <On the wisdom of isolating the Visegrad Quartet, which is opposed to Timmermans, he said: ""There is a need for compromise. If there is a majority for an option, the majority will not accommodate some. You know, sometimes on a trip, the bus has to close the door and move on if you are waiting for someone. But I do not want to prejudge. That is speculation. I hope that we will reach a compromise and unanimously choose someone, because that is a better way forward."" <p/> Asked how long they would sit at the table, he replied that he did not know that either and that if he had his way, they would not sit for long. <p/> Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, arriving at the EU summit, predicted difficult negotiations on leadership positions, in particular on the new President of the European Commission, and warned of an institutional conflict between the European Council and the European Parliament.

857,"Sports hall completed <p/> After twenty-five years of work, a new multi-purpose sports hall has been completed in Mengeš, which will be used by schoolchildren in the morning and by associations and other citizens in the afternoon and evening. It will be handed over on 1 October. <p/> The hall cost €4.5 million and Mengeš also obtained a grant for the investment. <p/> Mengeš - The multi-purpose sports hall, located next to the Mengeš Primary School, is almost complete after a year since the foundation stone was laid last June. These days, workers are sanding and varnishing the parquet flooring, while minor landscaping work is being carried out on the external areas. <p/> According to the Director of the Mengeš Municipal Administration, Urban Kolar, a technical inspection will be carried out on Thursday and the hall will be handed over on 1 October. <p/> The hall, together with the outdoor playgrounds and the athletics track with tartan and climbing wall inside, will primarily be used for sports lessons and other leisure activities of the Mengeš Primary School, but other local associations and citizens will also be able to use the hall in the afternoons and evenings. ""I don't think it is a question of whether it will be occupied or not. There is also a lot of interest from associations and individuals from the surrounding municipalities. I think we could easily fill the dates, even if we had another hall,"" says Kolar, who is particularly pleased that the municipal administration has managed to carry out such a large investment without taking out a loan, thanks to the grants they have received. The EcoFund contributed 845 thousand euros for the low-energy facility, five hundred thousand were obtained from the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport, and a further 65 thousand from the Foundation for Sport.The EcoFund has also contributed 845 thousand euros for the low-energy facility. The contract value of the hall is €4.5 million, it was built by Graditelj from Kamnik, with whom Mengeš was very satisfied, and the interior fittings, worth €660 thousand, are being installed by Elan Inventa. <p/> The construction of the new sports hall will free up the current gym of the primary school, which is to be converted into a kitchen and dining room, as well as four additional classrooms. ""With almost nine hundred pupils, Mengeška Primary School is one of the largest in Slovenia. The municipality has already solved the space problem in the past by building extensions, first to the west, then to the east, and now the third phase, the reconstruction of the school gym, is on the cards,"" says Kolar, who adds that the procedures have already started, but it is too early to talk about the amount of the investment, as they need to get the designers' estimates first. The municipality will certainly have to take out a loan for the investment. <p/> The redevelopment of the gymnasium is therefore the final stage in solving the school's space problem, which will ensure that Mengeš has enough classroom capacity for the next few years. However, given that the immigration trend in the municipality is quite high and the population could easily grow from the current 8200 to tens of thousands or more in the next few years, any future space needs of the school will have to be solved by setting up a new primary school or a branch, Kolar believes.",News/Reporting,train
859,"How many billions of euros are sticking out of our banking hole? <p/> Have we filled Slovenia's banking hole with too many billions? A billion too much is said to have been spent on the biggest bank alone <p/> If some economists, bankers and even forensic experts are to be believed, Slovenia's banking hole was actually too shallow for all the billions of taxpayers' money that have leaked into it. According to some estimates, a billion euros too much was spent on the rehabilitation of the largest bank alone. And all the mistakes in the bank bail-out are estimated to have cost at least a meagre three billion euros. Despite the European warnings, the banking hole will be open for domestic auditors to dig into. But only on a limited basis, as some documents will not be accessible to the domestic umbrella banks. The average citizen, who could have spent his or her investment in bank recovery on, say, a nice luxury exotic trip, will have to be content with these (limited) findings. <p/> The banking hole has been the subject of years of work by bankers, politicians, criminals and, last but not least, ordinary citizens. How could it not, since the last bailout of the banks in 2013 was so ""fat"" that it simply cannot be ""swallowed"". A good €3 billion cost taxpayers the last bank bailout four years ago. And it is precisely because of concerns and allegations that the whole bail-out was oversized by billions of euros that people want an epilogue to this story. Probably no one in Slovenia is counting on the kind of conclusion that the Icelanders have written in their banking story. This country of just over 300 000 inhabitants has become a model for the Western world in terms of how to prosecute criminal practices in the banking sector, with the imprisonment of 30 bankers and financiers who were responsible for the collapse of three banks in 2008. Time will have to tell how we will conclude the story at home. <p/> Where did the billions go? <p/> In 2013, many people believed that a big taxpayer bailout of the banks was really needed. Every last cent. This is what bankers, not just domestic bankers, but also European bankers, those from the European Central Bank, the central financial institution in the euro area, were convincing citizens. And if Boštjan Jazbec, Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, said at the time that ""Slovenian banks will be among the better capitalised in the euro area after the recapitalisation"", the laity could not doubt it. <p/> What actually happened? At the end of 2012, when speculations started to emerge that Slovenia would have to ask for international help because of the bad debts Slovenian banks had accumulated, the Parliament opened the door wider for the Bank of Slovenia to intervene in ailing banks with an amended Banking Act. Less than a year later, the Bank of Slovenia, together with the Ministry of Finance, ordered asset quality reviews and stress tests for NLB, NKBM and Abanka and, under special conditions, for Banka Celje, Gorenjska banka, Probanka, Factor banka, Unicredit banka ' Slovenija, Hypo Alpe Adria Bank and Raiffeisen banka. The quality review was carried out by Deloitte and EY and the stress tests by Oliver Wyman and Roland Berger. <p/> The estimates showed that the capital shortfall in the banks reviewed in the worst case scenario would be almost €5 billion and that €3 billion would be needed to recapitalise NLB, NKBM and Abanka. We taxpayers have ""paid for"" these, not only with taxpayers' money, but also by expropriating the holders of subordinated bonds and shares in the nationalised banks. Small shareholders - according to the Association of Small Shareholders, some 100,000 shareholders and 2,000 subordinated bondholders with €600 million in assets, some half a million savers in pension, management and insurance companies, as well as many companies and municipalities - protested and sought legal solutions. The Constitutional Court, even after responses from Europe, ruled that parts of the banking legislation that allowed for the forced deletion of qualifying liabilities did not contravene the Constitution and did not interfere with the right to private property. However, it is unconstitutional that the legislation failed to provide effective judicial protection to those affected. The Court therefore ordered the National Assembly to remedy the unconstitutionality within six months and ordered the suspension of the limitation period for claims for damages. <p/> Too much money in the banks <p/> Soon there were rumours that we had put too much money in the banks after all. Already two years ago, an unnamed Bank of Slovenia official told Finance that the data underlying the Bank of Slovenia's actions in the then nationalised banks were allegedly manipulated and the banks overcapitalised. Last year, a criminal investigation was launched in connection with the bank bail-outs, where the Bank of Slovenia, NLB and the auditing firms Ernst & Young and Deloitte came under scrutiny. The proposal for an investigation order published earlier this year, however, brought familiar accusations and arguments that have been coming from expropriated small shareholders and holders of subordinated liabilities since the banks were nationalised and rehabilitated at the end of 2013. The basic dilemma is, insofar as it is possible to understand the complex facts, that the picture of the banking portfolio was still positive in mid-2013, but that, after reassessments after only a few months, a deep banking hole had opened up, which is why, four years ago, we offered the banks a three-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion bail-out. That is to say, that the whole bank bail-out was tailor-made so that the holders of subordinated bonds lost everything in it. And that the capital shortfall in Slovenian banks could perhaps have been estimated much lower at the time. <p/> As reported in the Slovenian media, the Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, Boštjan Jazbec, the former Vice-Governors Stanislava Caprirola and Janez Fabijan, and Tomaž Čemažar of the Central Bank have been accused of abuse of official position. The prosecution's thesis was that they were aware that the reports on the state of the NLB were not made in accordance with the rules and on an acceptable basis, and therefore there was no legal basis for the extraordinary measures at the NLB.<p/> The fact that the size of the banking hole was oversized was confirmed to the DZ Commission of Inquiry by Andrej Hazabent, a former member of the Management Board of the NLB, who estimated that a billion too much money had been invested in the NLB alone.<p/> The Commission of Inquiry was also told that the size of the hole had been oversized. Among other things, he told the commission that NLB's operating profit was falling, ""so it comes from the unwinding of over-provisioning. If the transfer resulted in a loss of €500 million, the rehabilitation of NLB is estimated at €1.6 billion, a billion too much, when €1.1 billion is paid in"", he outlined. <p/> In the middle of last month, however, the newspaper Delo revealed a study by economist Veljko Bolet, who calculated that the banking hole was oversized by several billion euros. <p/>Obstacles from Europe <p/> The answers and facts about the banking hole will therefore have to wait. It remains to be seen whether the real numbers will ever crystallise. The public prosecutors immediately came under pressure for illegal activities in the collection of information in the banks. Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), protested last year about what he considered to be the illegal confiscation of information by the ECB. The ECB has also taken the matter to the Constitutional Court over the confiscation of its files in the context of the criminal investigation. The Bank of Slovenia has already lodged a constitutional complaint against the order itself. <p/> A few weeks ago, the European Commission decided to send Slovenia a first warning letter under the infringement procedure in relation to the seizure of ECB information in the context of a criminal investigation into the Bank of Slovenia in July last year. <p/> Meanwhile, the Slovenian government has decided to amend the Banking Act to allow the Court of Auditors to assess the efficiency and regularity of the Bank of Slovenia's operations and the decisions that led to the use of public funds. But to a limited extent. In particular, the State Auditors will not be allowed to audit the implementation of monetary policy, the application and interpretation of law and supervisory practices, and will not be allowed to interfere with the powers exercised by the Bank of Slovenia as an integral part of the European System of Central Banks. Nor will the Court of Auditors be able to impose corrective measures on the Bank of Slovenia or to call for the dismissal of the Governor. <p/> The Court of Auditors has already pointed out that in order to give an opinion on the Bank's operations, it needs to see all the documentation, and the Court of Auditors' first president, Tomaž Vesel, has even said that ""it is not appropriate for the Bank of Slovenia or the ECB, of which Sanka Slovenije is a part, to be able to decide which documentation should be reviewed and which should not be reviewed in a directional manner. However, strict restrictions on the timing of the public disclosure of the findings on these documents are understandable"". <p/> Since the amended law granting the Court of Auditors these powers is not due to enter into force until next year, the epilogue on the banking hole will probably have to wait for some time.",Opinion/Argumentation,train

863,"We have several different materials available for solid or masonry construction. You can choose brickwork with improved thermal insulation properties (thermosheet), lightweight blocks made of aerated concrete or expanded polystyrene formwork, the core of which has to be filled with concrete. Their properties, thermal insulation and method of construction are described below. <p/> All of these materials can be used to achieve a thermal transmittance of the whole external wall composition that meets the criteria of low-energy or passive construction. A wall constructed with a higher thermal conductivity material will need to be faced with a thicker layer of thermal insulation to achieve the same or at least a similar effect as a wall constructed with a lower thermal conductivity material. The materials also differ in the way they are constructed and the time taken for the walls to dry, as well as in how or with which additional elements they can be used to facilitate detailing and prevent thermal bridging. <p/> Thermal bricks in different sizes <p/> Bricks with improved thermal insulation properties are available in different shapes and sizes, and are also chosen by builders because they are a natural material. Goriška Brickworks offers thermal bricks 39, 29 and 25 cm thick. The thermal conductivity of the former is 0.22 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of a wall made of them is 0.51 W/m2K. The thermal conductivity of the second and third bricks is 0.24 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of a wall made of 29 cm thick bricks is 0.72 W/m2K and the thermal transmittance of a wall made of 25 cm thick bricks is 0.83 W/m2K. All of them have in common a linearly offset honeycomb and an increased mass of clay per unit volume of brick compared to conventional bricks, says Gregor Malik of Goriška brickworks. The offset honeycomb helps to allow both cold and heat to travel longer into the building, while the mass of the bricks significantly increases heat accumulation and thus helps to better regulate the temperature in the room. <p/> The brickwork does not differ significantly from conventional brickwork, the only difference is the design of the vertical ties, which is made much easier by the pero-utor system. In this case, the mortar is just shaken into the pocketed core that is formed when one brick is brought closer to the other, explains Malik, adding that it does not matter what weather conditions the building is built in. Every bricklayer knows that a period of cold and frost or a strong summer shower is not the best time for quality construction. In winter, the water in mortar can freeze, causing inappropriate reactions in its bonding with the bricks, so that the bonds are weaker than they would be at the right temperatures. In the summer heat, the mortar dries out too quickly due to the heat and the unmoistened bricks. <p/> For thermal insulation of thermo-brick walls, Goriška Brickworks recommends vapour-permeable insulating materials. 12 cm of stone wool on the thickest brickwork achieves a low-energy standard, while 18 cm of the same insulation achieves a passive standard. A 25 cm wall should be lined with 14 cm of stone wool for a low-energy house or 20 cm of stone wool for a passive house. <p/> For a square metre of wall, we will use 20 39 cm thick bricks, 15 29 cm thick bricks and 12.5 25 cm thick bricks. All earthquake-resistant corner and wall elements and the corresponding halves are also available to the builders. <p/> Special adhesive instead of mortar <p/> Wienerberger Opekarna Ormož offers builders of low-energy and passive houses, among other things, thermal masonry in various thicknesses made of ground bricks, using special adhesive instead of mortar, and system solutions for thermal bridges in the vertical and horizontal bond area and lintels with integrated external blinds boxes to facilitate and improve the quality of the detailing. <p/> The passive standard is already achieved with 30 cm thick thermo-walls, which have a thermal conductivity of 0.14 W/mK and must be lined with 20 cm of insulation material with a thermal conductivity of 0.032 W/mK. The thermal transmittance of such a wall is 0.12 W/m2K, says Boštjan Kosec of the Ormož brickworks, adding that the low-energy standard is achieved by lining 30-centimetre-thick bricks with 15 centimetres of polystyrene insulation. <p/> For external walls, vertical earthquake-resistant ties are also used at about four to six metres and at all corners. Additional elements such as corner blocks for the vertical ties and corner blocks to solve the thermal bridge problem in the area of the vertical tie, a system lintel with a box for external blinds, a ceiling system and semi-prefabricated pre-stressed lintels, and insulation elements to insulate the horizontal ties (wreath bricks, wreath formwork) facilitate the masonry work. <p/> The average weight of a cubic metre of external wall is approximately 1 000 kilograms. The time required for brickwork depends on the size of the bricks. For a cubic metre of wall, 85 conventional bricks, 3.7 hours and 220 litres of fresh mortar are needed. For a cubic metre of 30 cm thermo-brick wall, 53 bricks, 3,2 hours and 180 litres of fresh mortar are needed. For a wall of the same size made of brushed thermal bricks, the same number of bricks is needed, but only 1.6 hours and the corresponding amount of polyurethane glue. <p/> Lightweight aerated concrete blocks <p/> Lightweight aerated concrete blocks with improved thermal conductivity can be chosen for the basic structure. The thermal conductivity of 350 kg/m3 blocks is 0.100 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of an external wall made of 40 cm thick blocks (50 cm thick blocks are also available on request) is 0.24 W/m2K. The thermal conductivity of 300 kg/m3 thermoblocks is 0.086 W/mK and the thermal transmittance of a 40 cm wall is 0.21 W/m2K. Both types of thermoblock already meet the requirements of the Energy Efficiency in Buildings Regulations (Pures) without additional thermal insulation, says Nataša Tavčar of Xella porobeton. She says that mortar losses are also important for the thermal insulation performance of a wall, and that they are negligible (less than 4%) in block masonry due to the thin-layer adhesive mortar, which is two to three millimetres thick. <p/> Thin-layer mortar requires precision, which is not difficult if the builder uses the right tools and follows the manufacturer's instructions. It is important that the first course is placed in a mortar that allows the unevenness of the substrate to be eliminated. Thin-set adhesive mortar should be applied with trowels to allow even application. In the following courses, any unevenness that occurs at the joints of the bricks shall be eliminated by the use of a levelling board. Additional elements are available to the builder to facilitate construction and solve thermal bridging problems: type lintels, anti-seismic blocks (for vertical ties) and U- and L-elements (for horizontal and diagonal ties). No additional formwork is needed, which makes construction even faster and ultimately cheaper, Tavčar adds. <p/> The amount of additional insulation depends on how energy-efficient the house is. A single-layer wall meets the Pures requirements for a 35-50 kWh/m2a energy-efficient house. For very good low-energy houses with a consumption below 20 kWh/m2a, an additional 10-14 cm of thermal insulation must be added to the 40 cm brickwork to ensure a thermal transmittance of the wall of 0.16-0.14 W/m2K. The builder can choose mineral thermal insulation boards which, like the blocks, are non-combustible (class A1), vapour permeable, strong, dimensionally stable and easy to shape. For a passive house, the thermal transmittance of the wall must be less than 0.15 W/m2K or, in the case of single-family houses, closer to 0.10 W/m2K. This value is achieved with 40 cm thick blocks and 22 cm of mineral panel insulation. <p/> Despite their large dimensions, porous concrete blocks are relatively easy to work with as they are very light. It takes only 1.71 hours to build a cubic metre of load-bearing wall with 40 cm thick blocks, or 1.92 hours with 30 cm thick blocks. A square metre of wall will take only eight blocks. <p/> Expanded polystyrene cladding <p/> The thermal performance of external walls for low-energy and passive houses can be achieved quite easily with a system consisting of expanded polystyrene elements, the core of which is filled with a concrete core. The certification of the German Passive House Institute confirms the suitability of the system for passive houses, as it allows construction without thermal bridges. The walls are 25 to 40 centimetres thick, the concrete core is 15 to 20 centimetres thick, and the bricks can be bought ready-assembled or assembled themselves using plastic spacers, which also serve as anchors for the reinforcement, says Nataša Jančar of Varčna gradnja. <p/> The thermal conductivity of the brickwork material is 0.029 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of the wall depends on the thickness of the brickwork - from 0.26 to 0.11 W/m2K, and the acoustic insulation is 44 to 54 dB. Each square metre of wall can hold 0.14 to 0.15 cubic metres of concrete, which means that a square metre of wall weighs between 350 and 400 kilograms, depending on the composition of the concrete and the thickness of the concrete core. <p/> Masonry will be faster if the design takes into account that all the dimensions of the building are divisible by 5 (cm), which means less cutting of the masonry, advises Jančarjeva. Otherwise, all that is needed is precision, care and following the instructions. The walls are concreted at half height, which corresponds to a larger or smaller pear of concrete for a normal-sized storey. The advice on concrete granulation is followed, and the walls are supported before concreting and the concrete is poured slowly, in layers. If the instructions are followed, we will pour flat monolithic walls without air pockets and, above all, we will achieve airtight joints with the reinforced concrete slab and the concrete roof, if we have chosen to do so. <p/> The point of the formwork, says Jančar, is that no additional thermal insulation is needed, as the energy efficiency of the house is already influenced by the choice of brickwork. If we buy the thinnest ones, i.e. 25 cm, we will catch Pures by a hair, but if we choose the thickest ones (40 cm), the house will be very energy-efficient, even passive, with the right siting and good external joinery. <p/> For an average sized house, even one storey per day can be built and watered with good organisation. For one square metre, you need four bricks (25 centimetres high and 100 centimetres long). The use of system elements such as lintels, wreath elements and ceiling and roof elements speeds up the construction process. <p/> Easy as rolling a dice <p/> A system similar to the one described above, which is also certified by the German Passive House Institute, also makes construction quick and easy. It consists of foamed polystyrene formwork elements that are simply placed together and the core is filled with concrete. The system allows for the construction of a building without thermal bridges in four different thicknesses, which are fully compatible with each other and can be combined on the same building, says Alen Mladinov from Arhem - PasivnaGradnja.si. The thermal transmittance of a 31 cm thick external wall is 0.17 W/m2K, the thermal transmittance of a 37 cm thick wall is 0.13 W/m2K and a 43 cm thick wall is 0.10 W/m2K. The last two thicknesses are suitable for passive houses, where no additional thermal insulation is required. <p/>All thicknesses are available with elements that have dried clay on the inside, and construction is facilitated by additional elements with metal connectors, elements without thermal bridges for lintels, ceiling connectors, roller shutter housings, balcony housings, circular corners, vault, external overhanging cantilever, etc. The programme for stairs, ceilings and roof insulation is also suitable for this purpose. <p/> The concrete core can be 15, 20 or 26 cm thick, depending on the structural requirements. One of the advantages of the system is that the entire floor can be constructed and concreted as such. The speed of production per cubic metre depends on the thickness of the elements. For normal buildings, it can take as little as ten minutes. In other words: a storey of a residential house can be built in one day, with all the window openings, spandrels and shutter elements, Mladinov says. For one square metre, we will use five elements.",Information/Explanation,train

869,"What do you need to know about sunglasses? <p/> Choose sunglasses that look great and protect your eyes at the same time... <p/> The wide range of sunglasses in all styles, prices and characteristics can make it difficult to decide which pair of sunglasses is best for you. Finding a pair of sunglasses you like may be easier if you read now about what to look out for and what types of sunglasses are out there. What should you look for in a pair of sunglasses? Three important things: quality eye protection, comfort and fantastic style. <p/> Put UV protection on the list of characteristics you look for in sunglasses <p/> Your sunglasses should offer protection against ultraviolet radiation, a component of the sun that increases the chance of sun damage. The FDA, the government agency that oversees the manufacture and sale of sunglasses in the US, recommends that you look for sunglasses with lenses that block 99-100% of UVA and UVB radiation. The label should say either UV 400 or 100% UV protection. <p/> Lens materials in sunglasses The difference between the lens materials on sunglasses is quite small. Some surfaces are harder than others, some types are more durable. Three materials are most commonly used for sunglass lenses: - polycarbonate; long-lasting lightweight plastic. - CR-39; a plastic usually used in lenses of a prescribed quality. - Glass; durable or much heavier to wear. <p/> Sunglass lens colour and other layers <p/> UV filter is one of the layers that make up the lenses of sunglasses, but there are many others besides. <p/> Sunglass lens colour The colour of the lenses serves to absorb the light that passes through them. The colour you choose is a matter of personal taste, but you should take into account a few important features related to the colour of the lenses. - The grey colour of the lenses reduces the amount of light and at the same time does not distort the colours. - Brown and amber reduce glare, including the glare created by the blue frequency in the Sun, which can make objects look hazy. Brown and amber lenses distort colours more than grey. - Yellow lenses reduce the blur caused by blue light better than brown, sharpening vision but causing colour distortion. <p/> - Green tints in lenses reduce glare and help filter out some blue light. They offer good contrast between objects. - Pink lenses might be a good choice if you participate in water sports or other outdoor activities, as they offer good contrast between objects on a blue or green background. <p/> Sunglasses with polarised lenses The polarised layer on the lenses reduces the glare that occurs when light is reflected off certain objects such as water, asphalt and other similar surfaces. Polarised lenses are recommended, but the choice is still yours. <p/> Make sure your glasses have scratch protection A thin layer can be applied to the lenses to make them more scratch resistant. Plastic lenses scratch more easily than glass lenses. <p/> Sunglasses with mirrored lenses <p/> Some sunglasses have a mirrored surface on the outside of the lens. Although they are very popular, scratches can appear on them very quickly. <p/> Sunglasses with photochromic lenses Photochromic (or photosensitive) lenses become darker when exposed to UV radiation. The change happens quickly when you swap the darker surroundings for a lighter one. <p/> Sunglasses with an anti-reflective layer An anti-reflective layer reduces the reflection of light hitting the back of the lens, thereby protecting the rays from reflecting into the eyes. <p/> Sunglasses frame shapes <p/> Sunglasses frames are made from plastic, base metals, titanium, aluminium and many other materials. You should try different types of frames to get a feel for their weight and decide which ones suit you best. <p/> Children also need sunglasses When buying sunglasses for children, be aware that children also need protection against UV rays and glare. Forget those little toy sunglasses; buy something that will really protect your child's eyes. <p/> Sunglasses with extra eye protection - The lenses of custom-made sunglasses keep out more light and UV radiation than ordinary lenses. - Wear a hat for more protection against the sun. This will help keep your skin looking young and healthy. Experts say that the less we squint, the fewer wrinkles we have. <p/> Choose sunglasses that suit your style Sunglasses styles change every year, just like any other fashion, but there's such a wide range that no pair of glasses can go out of style. And sunglasses don't have to be expensive to be effective, so you don't need to buy a whole new collection. Designer and specialised sunglasses have a higher price tag than most other glasses, apart from those used for sports, but you can find all kinds of modern eyewear at affordable and accessible prices. It is just important to look out for the UV label. If you already know what frame shape suits you best, go to the store and try on different styles of glasses. If you get permission, you can also take them for a walk outside to see how the glasses actually perform in practice. <p/> News",Instruction,train

Since it is fat soluble, it is recommended to consume it with some fat. When consumed, it is slowly converted in the body into vitamin A in the liver and also has antioxidant properties. The body converts it as needed, but in children this conversion is not as extensive as in adults, so vitamin A deficiency can occur. It plays an indispensable role in bone growth and building, skin repair, good eyesight, reproduction and is an extremely powerful stimulant of the immune system. Symptoms of vitamin A deficiency include night blindness, eye problems, problems with blood formation, diarrhoea, skin diseases, susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infections. Night blindness can develop into severe visual impairment. <p/>Who we recommend it for: <p/> To people who want to maintain good eyesight <p/> Before going on holiday to prepare the skin for sun exposure, and to anyone who wants to keep their tanned complexion a little longer <p/> To people who are deficient in Vitamin A <p/> Beta Carotene for good eyesight <p/> Beta Carotene is a precursor of Vitamin A; it can be converted by the human body into Vitamin A according to need. Vitamin A is a building block of the retina, an essential part of our eyes with an indispensable role in maintaining good vision. Vitamin A also contributes to the maintenance of healthy mucous membranes and healthy skin. <p/> Benefits of vitamin A <p/> As a powerful antioxidant, vitamin A protects the brain from premature deterioration, protects against the effects of UV rays and strengthens the immune system. The need for this vitamin is greatly increased in all intestinal diseases with consequent impaired absorption, chronic diseases and exhaustion. As it also protects the skin well against the sun, it is recommended to take it during sunbathing. <p/> It is recommended to start taking beta-carotenes at least 2-4 weeks before prolonged sun exposure and to continue during the sunbathing period, together with the use of a sunscreen with an appropriate SPF. <p/>Warning: The recommended daily amount or dose should not be exceeded. A food supplement is not a substitute for a balanced and varied diet. Keep out of reach of children! Store at temperatures up to 25 oC, protected from moisture and light. <p/>Warning: Smokers and persons working with asbestos should consult a doctor before use.

They work in a targeted way with a specific purpose, such as to strengthen the immune and nervous systems, balance the functioning of the glands and internal organs, increase circulation, maintain psycho-physical vitality, ease depressive states, etc. In addition, they enhance the functioning of the neutral or meditative mind, the faculties of intelligence, perseverance and perfection.

Namadeva disagreed with his approach, believing that man should rise to the level of the Divine and not slip down. Therefore he sat and chanted the name of God. The more intensely he chanted it, the more the water level in the well rose, and finally it even overflowed its rim. Without much effort, Namadeva took a drink and felt blissful.

922,"Ombudsman <p/> ČP <p/> Consistency in responding and length of inspection procedures also at local level remains a problem <p/> The Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia found that the Inter-municipal Inspectorate of the Joint Municipal Administration - 5G violated the principle of good administration by failing to respond to the petitioner, who had submitted several reports to it, in accordance with Article 17 of the Regulation on Administrative Operations, and by inexplicably failing to follow up on the petitioner's request for a tailored method of communication. The inspection of the petitioner's first complaint was carried out one day before the reply of the Inter-municipal Inspectorate to the Ombudsman and almost 11 months after the complaint, which the Ombudsman considers to be an unacceptable length of time. Both the inspection procedure concerning the petitioner's first and second complaint are still pending. <p/> * * * * <p/> The Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia (the Ombudsman) dealt with the petitioner's petition concerning the alleged pollution of her property with various sewage and waste. The petitioner informed the Ombudsman that she addressed her letters and complaints to, inter alia, the Municipality of Škofljica (the Municipality) and the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate and Redarstvo of the Municipalities of Grosuplje, Ig and Škofljica (the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate).The tasks of the Inter-Munial Inspectorate were in the meantime taken over by the Joint Municipal Administration 5G, within which the current Inter-Munial Inspectorate operates. <p/> The Ombudsman has not found any irregularities in the conduct of the Municipality, which received the petitioner's communication for information only and therefore did not respond to it. <p/> According to the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate, it received the petitioner's complaint on 24 June 2019 regarding the pollution of her property with waste water allegedly caused by the owners of neighbouring properties, and an inspection was to be carried out on 22 June 2020, but it has not yet informed the petitioner of its findings pursuant to Article 24 of the Inspection Control Act (ICA). He is expected to do so at the end of the procedure, which leads the Ombudsman to conclude that the inspection procedure has not yet been completed. <p/> In the past year, the petitioner submitted two reports to the Inter-municipal Inspectorate. The first report, concerning construction waste dumped on her property, was received by the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate from the Ljubljana-Vič Police Station on 19 May 2020. The Inter-Municipal Inspectorate referred this report to the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for the Environment and Spatial Planning (IRSOP), which informed the petitioner and the Ombudsman. A second complaint by the petitioner concerning the alteration of nature trails was received by the Inter-municipal Inspectorate on 27 May 2020 and referred to the IRSOP. An inspection has not yet been carried out in this respect. <p/> Taking into account all available documentation, the Ombudsman found that the inspection of the petitioner's first complaint was carried out one day before the Inter-municipal Inspectorate's reply to the Ombudsman and almost 11 months after the complaint, which we considered to be unacceptably late. We pointed out to the Inter-municipal Inspectorate that, while it is true that, in accordance with Article 4 of the CPC, inspectors are independent in carrying out inspection tasks within the scope of their powers and that inspection procedures are (primarily) procedures in the public interest, this does not in itself justify significant delays such as those experienced in the specific case. We have also clarified that Article 24 of the CPC does not constitute an obstacle to the inspector informing the notifier of his actions at an earlier stage in the light of the principle of good administration, nor does it relieve the inspector of his obligation based on the provision of the first proviso to Article 17(1) of the CPC to inform the notifier of his actions at an earlier stage. The Inspector is not under any obligation under Article 17 of the Administrative Procedure Regulation (APR), according to which the authority is obliged to reply to all correspondence from which it can be inferred that the authority expects a reply and the identity of the sender, unless the content of the correspondence relates to a procedure pending before the authority, the correspondence is vexatious, or the authority has already replied to the sender on a substantially similar issue. The Authority is obliged to reply, in accordance with the second paragraph of that Article, no later than 15 days after receipt of the document, to the address indicated in the letter. On the basis of the reply received from the Inter-municipal Inspectorate, we conclude that the petitioner did not receive such a notification. In addition to the above, the Ombudsman also noted that, although the Inter-municipal Inspectorate had informed the petitioner of its decision to withdraw the notification to the IRSOP, it had not followed her request for an adapted method of communication. After further enquiries by the Ombudsman, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate agreed that, in accordance with the UUP, it should have dealt with the cases as quickly as possible and replied to all correspondence within 15 days. However, in his opinion, this is not always possible, mainly due to the large number of reports received, the work priorities, as well as the prolonged sick leave. He stressed that the risk assessment, the public interest and the nature of the infringement must be taken into account when dealing with reports, the conduct of inspection procedures and the criteria for setting priorities, and was aware that this was not a sufficient justification. As regards the follow-up of the procedure, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate stated that it had been in contact with the petitioner by telephone and that a joint field visit would be carried out as soon as possible in the light of the petitioner's possibilities. <p/> The Ombudsman considered the response of the Inter-municipal Inspectorate, assuming the veracity of its allegations, to be adequate, but at the same time expressed doubts that a positive development in the specific case would have taken place even without its intervention. The Ombudsman has been drawing attention to the lengthy nature of inspection procedures at both national and local level for many years, but unfortunately, despite the Ombudsman's repeated appeals, progress cannot be assessed as satisfactory. In any case, the large number of cases handled by the average inspector cannot be ignored, taking into account the already chronic staff shortage in all inspectorates. This does not, of course, in itself justify the lengthy decision-making process in this case and in many others. <p/> In conclusion, the Ombudsman expressed the expectation that, taking into account all the relevant circumstances, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate would conclude both inspection proceedings within a reasonable time and that it would inform the petitioner of its findings in a manner that would be appropriate for her, at the latest at the end of the proceedings. The Ombudsman considers the present petition to be well-founded and has found a breach of the principle of good administration.",Legal/Regulation,train

931,"Which foods are good to eat together and which are not <p/> It is often food combinations that complicate the metabolism. If we don't eat the right combinations, even healthy foods don't help us. <p/> 1. Don't eat protein and starch together Avoid eating simple carbohydrates and protein in one meal. Do not combine bread, rice and cereals with fish, eggs, meat, milk and dairy products. The body needs an alkaline base to process starch and acids to process protein. This combination causes bloating, abdominal pain, indigestion, etc. <p/> 2. Eat protein only with vegetables <p/> 3. Eat starch only with vegetables Combine starchy foods such as rice, potatoes and pasta only with vegetables. <p/> 4. Fruit Eat fruit 2 hours before, or after a meal. Fruit is so special in every way that you will gain the most from digesting it on its own. It is important that fruit triggers the fermentation process, which in combination with other foods can interfere with other metabolic processes. Be careful with melons. Melons are faster to digest than other fruits, so be careful when mixing fruits together. <p/> 5. Don't mix starch and sugar Cookies can be really hard to resist, but when you mix starch and sugar in your mouth, enzymes are secreted to break down the starch, and the sugar makes your body acidic. Acidity slows down the breakdown of starch and you are trapped in an unsolvable digestive loop. <p/> 6. Do not combine milk with anything Pasteurisation destroys the enzymes that stimulate digestion. Milk starts to coagulate when it reaches the stomach and this slows down the digestion of other foods. Of course, this applies only to cow's milk. <p/> 7. Avoid sugar The problem of sweets is even greater because most of us already have a portion of protein, starch and carbohydrates in our stomachs. All of this further complicates digestion. In this case, we like to say that some food is stuck in our stomach, which is actually true, because the metabolic methods are mutually exclusive. You may have heard somewhere that it would be better to eat desserts half an hour before a meal. The benefit would be twofold: a large part of your metabolism would have been done by the time you had your main meal, and you would be less hungry and eat less. <p/> vkj",Instruction,train
932,"After Empire <p/> Why is America now generally perceived as a self-righteous, violent warmonger? How has a country that until recently played a vital role in shaping the international order suddenly become a symbol of global disorder? Why is America no longer the world's leading example of liberal democracy, international security and economic prosperity? Is the United States, the world's only surviving superpower, in danger of becoming marginal - of finding itself in a world that no longer needs it? <p/>After Empire, a critically acclaimed European bestseller, is a provocative and ultimately sobering look at America's changing role in the international community. Emmanuel Todd shot to fame when, in his first book, La Chute finale, he accurately predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union by analysing the country's fertility rates, infant mortality rates, marriage rates and literacy rates. Now - with the diagnosis that America's supremacy is weakening, which he made on the basis of demographic and economic factors - Todd offers an interesting re-evaluation of American superiority. <p/> Todd shows that at a time when the rest of the world is finding that it can get along without America - more and more countries are becoming educated, democratic and economically stable - America is slowly realising that it cannot get along without the rest of the world. Burdened by a huge domestic and foreign trade deficit, the falling value of the US dollar, the unexpected bankruptcy of several important companies and the fact that it can no longer support itself with its own production, America is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign money. This dependence is steadily eroding its political and economic influence, which is unprecedented in history. <p/> Readers' views <p/> In 2017, it is no longer possible to talk about a unipolar world order. What seemed unbelievable to the superficial observer in 2014 has become a reality. It is no longer possible to take decisions in the Eurasian area without the involvement of Russia or China. But let us go back a step further. The brief war in 2008, when Georgia sought to annex the separatist republic by force, was one of the first harbingers that the balance of power had changed. The Russian army was still clumsy at the time - compared to the annexation of Crimea - but it defeated the Georgian army, equipped and trained by the Americans, in a mere five days. <p/> In 2008, however great an optimist he was, he could not - however much he wished to - say much good about the Russian economy. Today, Russia has become the largest grain exporter, a self-sufficient food producer, and a force that is reviving and revitalising the automotive, aerospace, petrochemical and electronics industries. It has shown that it can no longer be blackmailed economically. <p/> The book 'After Empire' was published in 2006, but its basic idea must have been laid no later than 2005, when we were all still deeply asleep and unaware of the tectonic changes that were about to take place. One could say that the book was visionary, which makes it an extremely interesting read, because how is it possible that the author could have had a hunch in 2005 - when we were calling the Russian army 'old iron' and making fools of its economics - about the direction in which the world was moving? - Matej P. <p/> A look into the book",Opinion/Argumentation,train

It's as if he had the gene for breast cancer, but he hadn't developed it. He had the genes for Parkinson's, and the accident activated them. So he had a double dose of everything. But he's fine now.'<p/> She added: 'Ozzy says that as far as the show is concerned, he has to finish it the way he did on his farewell tour, he's still got a year of shows ahead of him that the accident prevented him from doing. He said it will not end like that. He will come back, even if it is just for one big farewell concert, but he will come back.'",News/Reporting,train

942,"It happened in the school year 2010/11... <p/> School in nature <p/> Wednesday8 June 2011 <p/> Three days of active and varied activities, despite the bad weather. We spend swimming lessons in the indoor or outdoor saltwater pool. So far we have visited the Bay of the Moon, the Strunjan Salt Pans and Portorož, where we have made our first purchases. We have learnt about the flora and fauna of the seaside and the weather phenomena associated with it. Today we will take a bus to Piran, where we will visit the aquarium and other sights of the city. Then we will take a boat trip to see the underwater world and the typical coastline with cliffs. Tomorrow we will have a swimming skills test and in the evening we will be entertained by the talents from Bistrica. We are happy with the accommodation, the food and the staff, and we are thinking of extending our stay until the end of the school year. A sea greeting to all of you who miss us and are thinking of us. 5th grade students and teachers. <p/> With imagination on the move <p/> Monday23 May 2011 <p/> On Monday 23 May 2011, the pupils of the extended stay and I attended the closing event of the national literary competition ""With imagination on the move"" in Vrhnika. The pupils participated in the competition with the story ""The Paradajzovi"", which you can read on the smar-team.org website (grade level). The pupils' story came in an excellent 4th place. The smar-team publishing house will publish the Paradajzovi story in a stand-alone picture book. The pupils were very enthusiastic and promised to take part in the competition again next year. <p/> Young History Researchers' Meeting <p/> Friday20 May 2011 <p/> On Friday, 20 May, Jasmina Vučko and Aleš Duh took part in the National Young History Researchers' Meeting within the framework of ZPMS and defended their research paper entitled ""They made a mark on our school"". Their assignment was based on the topic ""The Role of Women in the Past"". They performed with flying colours and earned a gold award. Congratulations to both of them and may this be an incentive for them to continue their work. Mentors. In the younger category, Jure Vučko took 4th place. In the most challenging event, the 100 m swim and 1000 m run, Jasmina Vučko from our school won. The best competitors (the top five in each category) will compete in the national triathlon championship in Ljubljana on 5 June, where they will also compete in the cycling event. Congratulations to both. <p/> Sports Spas - A day of movement and socialising for all generations <p/> Saturday14 May 2011 <p/> On Saturday 14 May 2011, the school organised an event called ""A day of socialising and movement for all generations. In beautiful sunny weather and a relaxed atmosphere, we started with a hike, then the participants took part in various workshops: sports elementary games, firefighter games with firefighters, eco workshop, healthy school workshop and a stand of the SVIT ecological centre, and the participants also had the opportunity to have their blood pressure measured. The natural environment, exercise, intergenerational socialising are of great importance for a positive life, so we look forward to such informal meetings with pupils, parents, relatives and others in the future. <p/> European Village <p/> Tuesday10 May 2011 <p/> On Tuesday, 10 May 2011, 13 students attended the European Village event in Murska Sobota's Culture Square. Our stand represented Schönbrunn Castle, where we presented interesting facts about our neighbour. The event was interesting both at the event area and at the stands. We invite you to attend the event again next year. There is always something new going on. <p/> Athletic multi-purpose <p/> Friday6 May 2011 <p/> On Friday, 22 April 2011, we held an athletic multi-purpose. The students of the first grade stayed at the school to compete in the triathlon. The pupils of the upper grades went first on a march to Črenšovce, as they competed in the stadium of the local primary school. The sports day started at 8:00 and the athletics part at 9:00. While the teachers prepared the individual stations, the pupils got ready for the sports activity - warmed up and then started the individual disciplines. The students had no major problems, competed fairly and everything went smoothly in terms of organisation, so we all came back happy. The results are posted on the sports education notice board. <p/> Hike along the river Mura <p/> Thursday5 May 2011 <p/> Thursday, 5 May 2011, after a long winter ""sleep"", was again the day for a hike in our joint PK activity. We went on a flat hike with the students along the river Mura all the way to the ford. On the way we observed the untouched nature, the life in the river, talked a lot, laughed and already planned a mountain plan for the new school year. There was no shortage of ideas, including the idea of fishing after the hike around Bukovnik Lake. When we arrived at the ford, we freshened up with a drink, sat for a while, and then a friendly man took us across the river in a ford. The trail led us all the way to the school, where we arrived at 16:30. In total, 7 pupils took part in the walk, the others, unfortunately, found all sorts of excuses or did not even justify their absence. Mountain greetings. <p/> Handball - regional competition <p/> Thursday21 April 2011 <p/> On 21 April 2011, the pupils who make up the school handball team took part in a regional competition held at the St. Jurij ob Ščavnici Primary School. The regional competition was also attended by the Grad Primary School and the parent school. Our competitors did well against the Grad Primary School, but the home school competitors were slightly better. For the second place, the pupils received medals and a trophy. The pupils were satisfied and can't wait for the next competition season. <p/> Final event of the E-KNJIGA project - HAND IN THE FIST <p/> Friday22 April 2011 <p/> (Source: Ministry of Education) <p/> On Friday 22 April 2011, the final event of the E-KNJIGA project was held. The final event of the nationwide project E-BOOK - SHAKE HAND IN THE FIST was held in Ljubljana on 22 April 2011, where representatives of twenty primary schools (132 e-books were produced in the project) were invited to present their e-books, which, according to the expert jury, had produced the best e-books. Our school was one of them, which we were very pleased about. Congratulations and prizes and awards were presented by Dr. Igor Lukšič, Minister of Education and Sport, and Mr. Dominik S. Černjak, representative of the sponsor of the event. <p/> Creative Workshops <p/> Thursday14 April 2011 <p/> ""I had a nice time!"" said the students who took part in the creative workshops on Thursday 14 April 2011 at our school. We also invited pupils from Odranci Primary School. The teachers of our school prepared a varied programme for them, with six workshops to choose from. In the creative workshop, the pupils created, sewed and glued denim (old jeans). It was also interesting to see how skilful the boys were with their sewing machines. In the music workshop, the pupils played Orff instruments and sang. The art and maths workshop was also interesting, with pupils making polyhedra of different shapes and sizes. Of course, they also made sure that the colours matched. In the sports-computing workshop, pupils tried their hand at long jump and took pictures. They then analysed their footage and made a short film (one of which is below), which they presented to us. The pupils who joined the geography workshop learned about the life and customs of the Indians and their way of life. They also made Indian clothes, got covered in war paint and made a model of a tent. In the microscopy workshop, pupils explored the world beyond the eye's view, including how salt concentration affects the functioning of a cell. <p/> Lendava Choir Festival <p/> Tuesday29 March 2011 <p/> On Tuesday 28 March 2011, we took part in the regional meeting of children's and youth choirs in Lendava with two school choirs. 16 choirs took part in the choir competition, 11 children's choirs and 5 youth choirs, a total of 450 young singers. At 14.00 we met the pupils in the music room, where they received their final instructions and got their hair done, and at 14.30 we were on our way to Lendava. Despite the fact that the rehearsal lasted two and a half hours and that we performed with both choirs in the last half of the event, the students did very well, which was confirmed by the audience. We also received positive feedback from the professional accompanist of the event, Ms Manja Gošnik-Vovk. I think that the festival has a positive value for the pupils, because apart from the fact that the pupils participate in front of such a large audience, thus gaining experience in public performance, the most important thing is that they get to meet their friends from other choirs and enjoy their own and other people's singing. (teacher Miha Kavaš) <p/> New price list <p/> Tuesday28 March 2011 <p/> At its 15th regular meeting, held on Monday 28 March 2011, the Council approved the new price list, which will come into force on 1 April 2011. The new price list is also available here (xls attachment). <p/> Formative monitoring and assessment in sport education <p/> Wednesday23 March 2011 <p/> For the second school year, our school is involved in a formative monitoring and assessment project. This time, on 23 March 2011, the lesson of sports education in grade 6 was conducted in front of the head teacher and other external teachers involved in this project. We were able to identify elements of differentiation and individualisation in the lesson, and the pupils monitored and recorded their own performance, moving around and trying to be critical of their own progress. We also followed the principles of physiological efficiency, instructiveness and presented the exercise in a fun way, with different teaching strategies and monitoring of their knowledge. <p/> Spring concert of three schools in Odranci <p/> Monday21 March 2011 <p/> On Monday, 21 March 2011, we took part in the spring concert of school choirs ""Sunny Song"" at the Odranci Primary School with the Children's Choir (OPZ) and the Youth Choir (MPZ). At 15.30 we took a bus to Odranci, where the concert started at 17.00. Choirs from Odranci Primary School and Franceta Prešeren Primary School in Črenšovci took part in the concert. At the end of the event, all the participating choirs sang together the eco anthem ""The World Around the Sun is Spinning"" to close the concert. After the event, the young singers gathered for a well-deserved snack. The pupils found the concert interesting, as they do not often have the opportunity to showcase their singing skills outside the confines of their home school, and at the same time sing together with around 200 singers from all three schools. <p/> Memorial ceremony in Monostru <p/> Saturday19 March 2011 <p/> On Saturday, 19 March, the students of our school, Larisa, Sergeja and Anja, took part in a memorial ceremony in Monostru. The Committee of the Prekmurje Company and Brigade invited us to commemorate the fallen in World War II. A wreath was laid at the Monostert cemetery for the fallen commander of the Prekmurje Company, Alojz Škerjanc - Mirko. The girls presented a short cultural programme. In today's society, where material goods seem to be more and more important and we often unintentionally forget about values such as camaraderie and loyalty to the homeland, our school tries to preserve the memory of past events and the values of the NOB in this way. <p/> Swimming course <p/> March 2011 <p/> 1st and 3rd grade students had a swimming course in Terme Radenci during the week of 14-18 March 2011. Read more at http://sportnavzgojaos.ucoz.com/index/0-6 <p/> Tourist Market <p/> Tuesday15 March 2011 <p/> Here you can see the assignment (.doc attachment) produced in the framework of the Tourist Market project. <p/> Carnival <p/> Tuesday8 March 2011 <p/> The carnival of the carnival of the wide-mouthed, the terrible noise of our places. Fairies, goblins and goblins, they have driven you into the cold tunnels. <p/> With our carnival revelry we have chased away winter. On this day, pupils and teachers dressed up, said a few words about the tradition, introduced themselves to each other, ate delicious doughnuts and paraded around the village. After the carnival procession, we all went together to the neighbouring school, the Franceta Prešeren Primary School in Črenšovci, and together, with pleasant music and a short programme, we had fun together and chose the most beautiful and original masks. <p/> Handball competition <p/> March 2011 <p/> On Friday and Monday, the younger pupils played an inter-municipal handball competition. The girls played against Odranci Primary School and were more successful than their opponents. They showed a good game in defence and attack and deservedly won. The pupils played against Odranci and Velika Polana. The opponents were tougher nuts, so they still have some work to do to qualify for the regional competition. Nevertheless, congratulations to all players and thanks to the fans for their fair cheering. <p/> Saturday School <p/> Saturday5 March 2011 <p/> On Saturday 5 March 2011, we organised a Saturday School to promote the talents of our students. The theme of the Saturday School was to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the OF and the 20th anniversary of Slovenian independence. Talented pupils from the third form participated. At the Saturday School, the pupils were given a presentation on the NOB in Prekmurje and then watched a film. This was followed by workshops where pupils made flags, visited a soldier from the Second World War, sang partisan songs and wrote a review of the film. The pupils liked the way they learned at the Saturday School and were very creative. <p/> Tech Day - Traditions of our grandfathers and grandmothers <p/> Thursday18 February 2011 <p/> On Thursday 18 February 2011, Year 6 pupils had a Tech Day entitled Traditions of our grandfathers and grandmothers. On this day they joined us and we spent a pleasant morning together. First we watched how our grandmothers used to spin, Mrs. Vučko showed us how to do it live, then they watched a part of the film Uncles Told Me, which was based on the novel of the same name by Miško Kranjc, and then we talked about the customs of the past - corn and seed husking, feather plucking, feasting, feasting, koline, blacksmithing, grazing ... Of course, we also asked our grandparents what it was like at school. You can see our findings on the second floor of the school, where posters are on display. Finally, we learnt all seventeen stanzas of the song Marko jumče (Marko jumps) and danced the folk dance shamarjanko. It was interesting for everyone and the day went by too quickly. <p/> English + sports education = ? <p/> Thursday10 February 2011 <p/> Is it possible to combine these two subjects?! Of course it can. At Prežihovega Voranca Primary School, we did just that last week, on 10 February 2011. We learned Slovenian in the gym, and of course we exercised there too. As the aim of the lesson was to consolidate and test both Slovenian and sports education, the tasks were differentiated (divided by difficulty) and many formative monitoring elements were included. The pupils thus self-assessed or assessed each other to see how far they were in their learning and knowledge journey. In this way, they developed critical thinking and were able to justify their findings on an ongoing basis. In addition to our headmistress and the seventh-graders, the gym also hosted the headmistresses of fifteen schools in the Pomurje region and the head of the ZRSS for Education, OE Murska Sobota, Ms Irena Kumer. The pupils found this connection very interesting and informative, and above all, they found out what they will need to consolidate before the next examination or assessment. This is certainly not the last lesson that has been carried out in this way, as we believe that a modern school should strive for work that is varied, experiential and lifelong. <p/> Golden Knuckle Competition <p/> Thursday3 February 2011 <p/> Three students from our school took part in the Golden Knuckle Competition at the Radenci Secondary School of Catering and Tourism on Thursday, 3 February 2011. The competition was organised by the Slovenian Tourist Board. Marcel Kocon, Larisa Filip and Katja Šemen competed for our school, and in preparation for the competition we had two more reserves, Niki Cigan and Ines Pozderec, both of whom were sick on the day of the competition. The students prepared chicken breast with cheese, matvezah and a simple red cabbage stew. As it was their first time taking part in the competition, they were well versed in the kitchen. They were successful and won a silver spoon or award. The competition was interesting, they learnt a lot of new things and the socialising with their teammates was also enjoyable. <p/> Chemistry Experiments <p/> Tuesday1 February 2011 <p/> On Tuesday 1 February, we started the elective subject Experiments in Chemistry (PEC). This course is open to students in grades 8 and 9. For the first day we prepared the experiment ""Pharaoh's snake"". We divided into three groups and prepared a real competition. <p/> The biggest Pharaoh's serpent was made by me and Jasmina. We were very impressed and took pictures with it. The other pupils were also successful. They came second and third. (Sergeja Lebar and Jasmina Vučko, 9th grade students) <p/> Sports Day in Maribor <p/> Friday28 January 2011 <p/> Today, 28 January 2011, students from our school went ice skating at the Maribor Ice Arena. The route took us from our school to the motorway, which we quickly followed to reach Maribor. There we made a short hike, had a snack and were able to skate for an hour and a half. Of course, we followed the rules that apply to ice skating. The sports day passed quickly and we came back healthy, a bit exhausted and full of impressions of the sports day. <p/> Winter hike to the Beavers <p/> Saturday22 January 2011 <p/> On Saturday we had a real winter hike to the Beavers. The air temperature was quite low and there was a slight breeze, but we were dressed appropriately (jacket, scarf, hat) and the pace of the walk was quickened, so that after a while we were warm enough. Despite the small number of participants (seven students), we enjoyed our time together and completed the route in 2.5 hours. For homework, the pupils have to describe their feelings on a blog. <p/> In future, it is expected that pupils will apologise in advance for their absence. They may excuse their absence before the march via the online diary. Greetings from the march, teacher Alojz. <p/> Happy birthday, Mr. Anton Törnar! <p/> Friday14 January 2011 <p/> Today, 14 January 2010, the Mayor of our municipality, Mr Anton Törnar, met Abraham. The staff of the kindergarten and the school, together with the children and pupils, would also like to congratulate him and wish him every success in his future endeavours. <p/> Visit to Radio Maxi <p/> Thursday13 January 2011 <p/> Today, the students of the elective course Media Education went to visit the premises of Radio Maxi in Ljutomer. We were welcomed by the friendly Vesna, who explained in detail everything about the radio, and she was helped by the equally friendly Bastino. We spoke live, and also tried our hand at recording, with the help of Mr Bojan. Mrs Jasna also explained how to order advertisements or greeting cards. We enjoyed our visit immensely and learned a lot of new things. The photo below was also taken as a souvenir. <p/> Handball competition <p/> Tuesday7 December 2010 <p/> On Tuesday, 7 December 2010, a handball competition for older pupils took place in the Črenšovci Sports Hall. The teams of three schools took part: the Franceta Prešerna Črenšovci Primary School as the organiser, the Odranci Primary School and our school. Our students showed a step forward in handball skills, fighting spirit and team spirit, but unfortunately not enough to win. The first team qualified for the further system of the competition. 1st OŠ ODRANCI 2nd OŠ ČRENŠOVCI 3rd OŠ BISTRICA <p/> A visit from St Nicholas <p/> ""Rituals are necessary ..."" said the Little Prince ... It is a time when one day is different from another, a school lesson that teaches and educates us in a different way. In this lesson, modern forms and methods of teaching are intertwined and the pupils are active. For many years now, we have been visited by the first good man at school, St Nicholas. He presents sweet treats to all of us who spend our daily lives together. This year, St Nicholas had with him a gold and a black book. We were already convinced that he had chased away the hellions ... He stressed that we are all ""more or less hard-working"". And that the good man likes to look through the fingers of those who are trying to be hard-working. He filled the dining room basket even more with fruit, left some sweets in his hat, and shook some chocolate in all our hands... This year, the folklore group ""Jankice"" performed the play ""The Family in the Past and Today"", which we recreated together on a literary template by Niki Cigan.There was no shortage of dancing, childish mischief and family relations, which, as in the past, families today live more or less efficiently on their own. The pupils, especially the youngest ones in the kindergarten, especially experienced the ""angelic playing"" of the violinist teacher Mihe. Without the parklands there is no real St Nicholas tradition, every fairy tale has good and bad characters, but it has to end happily. In hidden corners we have saved this day for those later adult times ... Anka Virag <p/> Football competition <p/> November 2010 <p/> On Wednesday, 3 November 2010, we went to a football competition in Turnišče with the older pupils. The pupils played two matches. They played against DOŠ Dobrovnik in a 2 : 2 draw, and against OŠ Turnišče, unfortunately, they lost 5 : 1. The home team showed more skill and deservedly qualified for the next round. Congratulations to all the players for their effort and fight. (teacher Alojz Krevh) <p/> Comenius project <p/> Tuesday16 November 2010 <p/> Since the beginning of this school year, our school has continued to work in the Comenius project and the students have been very active. Finally, they have helped to improve the environment, including for future generations, by reforesting. Read more about the work of the project here. <p/> Second mountain hike - Atilla's trail <p/> Friday5 November 2010 <p/> On Friday, 5 November 2010, we followed the trail of the Hun King Atilla, also known as ""the whip of God"", who stopped at Kapel on one of his military expeditions. We started at the cemetery car park in Radenci and followed the trail to Kapela. The path is marked with white hearts, here and there is an arrow with the name of the path. We continued towards the church, from where we had a wonderful view of Radgona and the surrounding hills.We continued towards the Valley of Peace, through the forest to the main road. Here we turned right along a longer path and from here we just followed the signs Hlaponci, Radenska pot and back towards Kapeli. We returned via an abandoned ski slope. We walked in beautiful weather, which also affected our mood. We had a great time. <p/> Tromejnik <p/> Thursday30 September 2010 <p/> We went on our first mountain trip, to Tromejnik, on Thursday 30 September 2010 at 13:00. We started in Trdkova, at the beginning of the macadam trail, walked to Tromejnik and then continued along the Austrian side. We returned the same way back. In the beautiful autumn weather, we had a lot of conversations, learned about the benefits of walking in nature, picked chestnuts along the way and had a great experience. The pupils confirmed that they were very happy and that they can't wait for the next hike. <p/> Dance <p/> Friday22 October 2010 <p/> On Friday 22 October 2010, the pupils of Grade 9 organised a dance for all the pupils of our school called Halloween Party, starting at 16:30. We had lots of fun games, competitions, etc. The pupils from 1st to 4th grade left at 18:00, when Helga the witch visited us. We continued dancing with the others. We told each other horror stories, danced; we had a good time. We finished the dance at 19.30. The Year 9 students then cleaned up the gym and went home happy. <p/> Award ceremony for Dorothea Fras <p/> October 2010 <p/> We are pleased to announce that our student, Dorothea Fras, has won first place in the art competition on the theme of Elders and Friendship, thus winning a beautiful prize. You can also see the picture in our publication. Doroteja attended the award ceremony in Ljubljana, where she had the opportunity to meet the Minister Dr Igor Lukšič. Once again, we would like to congratulate Dorothea and her mentor, teacher Karmen Modlic. <p/> Sports Day - Cross Country <p/> Thursday11 October 2010 <p/> On Monday, 11 October 2010, we had an inter-municipal cross country event in Črenšovci. Four schools competed (Prežihovega Voranca Bistrica Primary School, Franceta Prešeren Primary School Črenšovci, Miška Kranjca Primary School Velika Polana and Turnišče Primary School). <p/> We arrived at the school at 8am, where we were met by the teachers. We were given a snack and we went in a column to Črenšovce. We were a bit scared before the run. There were already three other primary schools on the playground of the primary school in Črenšovce. First they gave us a big welcome and a short programme. Then there was a tour of the course for the first class, and then for the others. The course was tiring and wet, so there were a lot of slip-ups. After the first four laps, the results were revealed. The first five classes had a little fun and went to our school. Later on we ran again and there was a prize-giving ceremony for the second and third grades. After the competition we returned to school. They were very tired but happy that we had done so well in the cross-country. You can see the results on the notice board. (Dominik, 6th grade) <p/> Science Day - Forest <p/> Thursday7 October 2010 <p/> On Thursday 7 October 2010, the 4th grade students had a science day on the theme of forest. We went to Bukovnica Lake, which is covered by beautiful beech forests. There we were welcomed by a forester who took us on a forest trail. We learnt about the tree species in the forest, the forest railway, animals in the forest, mushrooms, the swamp and the characteristics of the forest edge and the alder log. <p/> We had an eco-technical day <p/> Tuesday5 October 2010 <p/> On Tuesday 5 October 2010, all the pupils of the school watched a theatre performance of The Tale of the Birch Tree. Under the guidance of storyteller Jane Stržinar and teachers, pupils from 1st to 5th grade created with packaging waste and natural materials. Fairy tale trees were created in the classrooms. The pupils learnt about different tree species and waste management. Some students created their own fairy tale tree to share with the rest of the pupils at the end of the day in the school gym. <p/> Fire drill <p/> Wednesday 13 October 2010 <p/> October is Fire Safety Month and that is why today, Wednesday 13 October 2010, we organised a fire drill at our school to refresh our knowledge on what to do in case of fire. The volunteer firefighters from Bistrita helped us and explained once again what to do in case of fire. We would like to thank them once again and call on them for help. <p/> Science Day <p/> Thursday 7 October 2010 <p/> On Thursday 7 October 2010, the pupils of grades 6, 7, 8 and 9 had a science day entitled ""Animals and plants of our environment"". We walked from the school to the river Mura, where different work stations were organised - one where the pupils learnt about the natural geography, identified trees and plants in the surroundings, determined the diversity of plants in a limited area and measured the temperature in the forest, forest edge and meadow; then compared it. With ornithologist Željko Šalamun, they walked from the Mura River bridge through the forest, learning about trees and other vegetation and listening to birds singing. We also found a crayfish in our river and two frogs; a green regia and a red-legged frog. It was a very educational and interesting day.",List of Summaries/Excerpts,train
943,"Children's Week <p/> Monday 4 October 2010 <p/> The week ahead is Children's Week. That's why we have decided to do something a little different in our school. You can see what we have and will be doing in the programme above. Today was the first day of this week, and we spent it in an interesting way. First, we welcomed our first graders into the school community, and then we headed off to Murska Sobota. The 6th graders got to know the work of the Regional and Study Library Murska Sobota, and the 7th to 9th graders got to know the heart of the city. We then watched films in the cinema to round off our first day of Children's Week.(Katja Kustec) <p/> This week some of our pupils and teachers are in Slovakia, Bratislava to be precise. Click on the link to read what they are doing there. <p/> Sports Day - Swimming <p/> Thursday24 September 2010 <p/> On 20 and 24 September 2010, we successfully and safely completed our first sports day of the school year. We went to the Radenci Spa with the pupils of the second and third grades, where the pupils enjoyed the water and water fooling around. The pupils swam, competed and had fun.

960,"Funeral vehicles <p/> 01/11/2013 <p/> Andrej Godeša Photo and sources.<p/> Some people go to heaven after death, others at least want to go to outer space <p/> People have always believed in an afterlife. In preparation for their final journey, they once prepared a more or less lavish journey depending on their status in society and the extent of their wealth. Often, so many grave goods were accumulated that a means of transport was used for the final journey, especially if the distance to the resting place was somewhat greater. The tradition has survived almost unchanged to the present day. People plan their final journey using a wide variety of means of transport. <p/> Funeral rituals have of course changed over the millennia, but the essence has remained the same. Human remains had to be buried, burned, immersed or otherwise disposed of. Both out of respect for the dead and the belief that the grave is only a way station on the road to eternity, and for purely practical reasons. By removing the corpse, they prevented beasts from coming near the dwellings, and they removed the source of the unpleasant stench of putrefaction and the risk of spreading infectious diseases. As human society evolved, status symbols soon appeared. Even after death, the high-ranking did not want to give them up, as best evidenced by the building of the pyramids. Rulers were escorted to their final resting place in ornate stretchers, chariots or ships. They were stocked with everything necessary for the mighty to live in the next life. In 323 BC, a funeral chariot with the first simple buffers was used to transport the golden sarcophagus containing the remains of Alexander the Great to Alexandria. Handcarts and horse-drawn carts became the main funerary vehicle for the next few millennia. After the invention of cannons in the 13th century and their gradual increase in size, a variation of this transport became the cannon laffete, a wheeled base for carrying cannons, on which the coffins of military leaders and officers were placed. It was only in the 19th century, with the introduction of the steam engine and the building of railways, that the body of the deceased was occasionally carried by train, while carriages continued to rule the short distances. In some large American cities, special subway cars were built for this purpose, but they did not ""catch on"". Perhaps the world's most famous rail journey was in 1865, when a steam train was used to transport US President Abraham Lincoln on his last journey from Washington, where he was assassinated. The body of the great leader who united Americans divided by the Civil War and abolished slavery was transported by a mourning train through several states to Illinois, where he was buried in a tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery. Closer to us in time and place is the final journey of former Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito, who was transported by train from Ljubljana, where he died in 1980, across much of Yugoslavia to Belgrade, where he is buried in a tomb at Dedinje. With the invention of the electric motor, the internal combustion engine and the automobile, new possibilities emerged for transporting the coffin from the deceased's home or hospital to the mortuary and on to the church, where a farewell service was held, and then on the final journey to the grave. It took almost half a century before motorised hearses became established, before engines became sufficiently powerful and, above all, reliable and quiet. The first mention of motorised hearses dates back to 1907, when a hearse with a built-in electric motor was introduced in Paris. Two years later, a petrol-engined hearse was built in the USA, but it was not until the 1920s that it became widely used. In the first period, especially during the First World War, the same vehicles were used for transporting the wounded and sick as well as for transporting bodies, but almost everywhere the basic purpose of the vehicle was soon separated by the choice of equipment fitted. In some rural areas of the USA, such combination vehicles were still in use in the second half of the last century. Because of the lower frequency of funeral transport, the vehicle was used as an ambulance to transport the wounded, and for the transport of the dead, the vehicle was decorated with curtains and flowers and other decorations before the journey and the vehicle was done. It was not until 1979 that such combinations were banned by US federal law. Most of the vehicles used for funerals are prestigious makes. This way, the deceased gets to ride in a luxury vehicle at least once (if not for life) after death. Maybe they use prestigious vehicles for this purpose more because of the relatives who would be embarrassed if the coffin was driven in a cheap car. In Europe, the most common funeral vehicles today are those based on Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Opel, Ford and, of course, in some places the legendary Rolls Royce or Daimler, while in the USA Cadillac and Lincoln are the leading models, and in Asia Mitsubishi, Toyota and Nissan. The production of hearse vehicles usually takes place in two phases. First, the chassis with the engine and the front section with the driving compartment are mass-produced in the factory, then the vehicle is finished by specialised coachbuilders who slightly reinforce the chassis and the brakes and equip the vehicle according to the wishes and fantasies of the final customer, the funeral company. Today, most funeral vehicles are made by converting station wagons from standard vehicles. Given the ""light work"" involved, these vehicles can last for decades with regular maintenance, so that specialist companies replace them more out of prestige than out of necessity. A few main styles of funeral vehicle fitting have become established around the world. These are usually the classical approach, which has survived from the carriages, which were richly upholstered with plush and curtains, or the limousine approach, where the vehicles are fitted with as many ornate glass surfaces as possible, which are inserted between the supporting pillars. In some parts of Asia, funeral vehicles try to emulate as closely as possible the classical forms of Buddhist temples, decorated with ornate, often gilded, decoration. More recently, in the desire for individuality and originality, some funeral companies have started to use more unusual combinations of vehicles for their clients' final journeys. In the UK, keen motorcyclists may choose a motorcycle with a sidecar to carry the coffin or the urn with the ashes on the final journey. They have come up with something similar with a tricycle and trailer. For those who are in a particular hurry to get to heaven (or more likely hell), they have produced a ""hot rod"" vehicle across the puddle with the symbolic number ""666"" on the door. In some parts of the world, boats are still used for funerals. At the turn of the 21st century, another wish of science and technology lovers has come true, and at the same time we have a new funeral vehicle - the space rocket. In the spring of 1997, the Pegasus rocket flew, carrying the ashes of 24 people who wanted to be astronauts, at least after death, and who could afford it, on its journey into space. The modified rocket, with lipstick-sized grills, orbited the Earth in an elliptical orbit for the next five years until it fell back in spring 2002. Among the ""passengers"" were Gene Roddenberry, screenwriter of the science-fiction film series ""Star Trek"", and Timothy Leary, a psychologist and futurist, best known for his ideas on the therapeutic effects of the drug LSD in the early 1960s. The next flight was the first real space funeral. The ""Lunar Prospector"" probe, which carried not only instruments but also a sample of the famous astronomer's ashes, landed on the Moon. Eugene Shoemaker (discoverer of the comet of the same name), the first man to be buried on the Moon, arrived there in the summer of 1999. In the following years, the death rocket flew several more times and has carried the remains of some 660 people into space to date. Among them are several famous people, such as astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the planet Pluto in the 1930s, James Doohan, better known as Scotty in the ""Star Trek"" film series, and Leroy Gordon Cooper, a member of the first US space expedition (Project Mercury) in the early 1960s.",Information/Explanation,train

Recent media reports that fires on buildings with solar power plants cannot be extinguished are incorrect. <p/> The Slovenian Fire Brigades Association (DFB) has drawn up recommendations for firefighters based on the intervention guidelines of the German Fire Brigades Association (DFB). The BISOL Group, the only domestic manufacturer of photovoltaic modules, has contributed its extensive experience and expertise to the development of these recommendations. In other parts of the world, the procedures for extinguishing fires at solar power plants are clearly defined, and BISOL has been familiar with them and has been following them from the outset. <p/> With many requests for advice from regional fire brigades coming to the BISOL Group, the Group is pleased that the Fire Brigades Association of Slovenia did, however, issue recommendations for firefighters last December and forwarded them to all the fire brigades associations across Slovenia. The recommendations clearly set out what to do in the event of a fire at a solar farm. The fire may be extinguished with water, subject to the prescribed minimum safety distance, which is 1 metre for medium-voltage energy installations extinguished with a water mist extinguisher and 5 metres for water jet extinguishing. Fire flames can also be stopped with a dust extinguisher, a CO2 extinguisher, and a foam extinguisher can only be used to extinguish non-energised appliances. <p/> As of 1 January, the amended Fire Regulations also finally came into force, requiring a fire plan to be drawn up for buildings equipped with a solar power plant connected to the public electricity grid. The fire plan must be displayed in a conspicuous place and brought to the attention of the regional fire brigade. All solar power plants of the BISOL Group shall be installed in accordance with the applicable regulations. <p/> In view of the success of photovoltaics on the global market, the BISOL Group firmly believes in the long-term viability of generating electricity from solar energy and looks forward to cooperating with the Slovenian Fire Brigades Association in the future.",Other,train

There are no changes to the top spots, with IBM's Summit and Sierra still at the top, followed by China's Sunway TaihuLight and Tianhe-2A, and Dell's Frontera in fifth place.

These licences have to be renewed from time to time, and in March this year, when they wanted them again, Microsoft told them that such a licence was no longer valid for them and sent them the usual commercial contract, which more than doubled the price of the licences. CERN officials disagreed and revived the idea of switching to open source solutions. And the Microsoft Alternatives Project, or MAlt for short, was born. And what is the project all about? In their blog, they write that the aim of the project is to ""regain control of our own data"", and that it will start with the migration of mail services and Skype to open source alternatives, and if all goes to plan, all other services will follow. <p/> Microsoft must of course have reacted to the decision, because CERN is an extremely prestigious institution and therefore a nice reference. It offered a ten-year transition period during which the price of the licences would gradually increase, but the people in charge at CERN rejected the offer, saying that such costs were simply not sustainable. <p/> If the project is successful, the decision will certainly have wider implications. CERN is not the only institution of its kind to face what is known as vendor lock-in, or dependence on a single supplier. If they can show that essential services can be delivered without Microsoft and other providers of licensed software over which the user has no control, other similar institutions may decide to take a similar step.",News/Reporting,train

The ARSO should also be commended for not falling under the euphoria like us young snow-lovers and then having noses 5x longer than the height of the snow cover, the last 5-10 cm of which I immediately subscribe to! <p/> Logged in <p/> Rosi T=1,4°C here we are practically done with the precipitation,it's all going too far south.At the end of the precipitation it just snowed for a few minutes,but to no effect. <p/> From Velenje, the illuminated transmitter at Urška is visible, and the fog has already risen to over 1200 mnm even on the Mozir mountains <p/> All I saw today that was similar to snow were a few more dense raindrops between Celje and Arja vasja at around 20:00, but otherwise just rain! <p/> Once again we stayed with long noses this year... <p/> Well, yes... it stopped raining (I put my car out in the rain and at least it washed off), I didn't see a single snowflake, I don't even know what the snowy surroundings of my home look like anymore,... but it could have been worse. It could have rained up to 1800m.a.s.l............................................... <p/> Maybe the precipitation mentioned above really will come to us... <p/> .. like us young snow lovers and then have noses 5x longer than the snow cover... <p/> That is to say, noses are no longer than before because 5 x 0cm = 0 <p/> Otherwise, here at +2.0°C and 98% RH, it is still raining lightly. No snowflakes in sight yet. They will come soon... but unfortunately too late. <p/> No sign of snow here either, it has stopped raining, I hope that's not all because the temperature is still dropping and it's 3.1. It's true that 14mm of rain fell, but somehow I was expecting more intense precipitation when I saw the maps! <p/> I'm really glad that at least the interior got snow, because otherwise I would have been lynched by my colleagues when I predicted snow in the forecast below. Oh, and Vrhnika will be at least a little bit white by tomorrow, and Logatec is already a little bit white, judging by the DARS pictures. <p/> Good night. <p/> Anyway, it's not a complete hoax, but it was close to it. <p/> Forecast Saturday, 02 February 2008 Latest weather models indicate a marginal snow situation in the lowlands of continental Slovenia. Wet snow may fall in the lowlands and will mainly melt. The greatest chance of snow cover in the lowlands is in the areas of Kočevje, Cerknica, Logatec, Postojna, Novo mesto and Snežnik and surroundings. There, between 5 and 10 cm of snow may fall under favourable conditions. In most parts of the country, snow is certain to fall at 500 metres above sea level or higher, especially during the night on Sunday, by which time it will have weakened and gradually stopped in the north and east of the country. <p/> What's up, they've got the models right Here it starts to mix with snow from 450m upwards, around Senožeč and Razdrteg it snows, but it doesn't stick...only about 50m higher up it starts. The intensity is terrible. Heavy precipitation over the Adriatic, Kvarner and Friuli. Temp here is +2.9, so that with suitable precipitation it would turn around later... so only storm with gusts around 50km/h, Podnanos even up to 80km/h Today 25.6mm fell. <p/> Žiri, temperature 0.9°C, snowing. A little higher it is white, but there is no ""force"". Well, yes, at least there will be something for an artistic impression, but if not sooner, next time.",Forum,train

986,"The Rectors' Conference of the four Slovenian public universities met in Maribor at the weekend for its first meeting since the University of Maribor took over the two-year presidency of the informal association. According to the Rector of the University of Maribor, Zdravko Kačič, the meeting focused, among other things, on the establishment of the e-Nakvis information system. <p/> Regarding the implementation of the system, which is experiencing some technical problems, Kačič said that they expect its quality implementation and smooth operation within six months, in line with a positive user experience. <p/> In addition to Kačič, the rectors - Igor Papič from the University of Ljubljana, Klavdija Kutnar from the University of Primorska and Danilo Zavrtanik from the University of Nova Gorica and his colleagues - also discussed the importance of the functioning of key support activities of universities related to the implementation of integrated career orientation for students, graduates and other target groups. <p/>The competent Ministry of Education, Science and Sport was called upon to ensure continued and continuous funding for the operation of university career centres and centres set up to support teaching, as these activities are a necessary part of regular higher education activities. According to Mr Kačič, these are funded on a project basis and are due to expire this year, so it would be advisable to start with permanent funding. <p/> There was also a discussion on legislation concerning universities, in particular the harmonisation of the law on research and development and the amendment to the law on higher education. The fall of the government was not the best thing for them, as they were on the verge of getting the draft laws through the parliamentary procedure. Kačič therefore hopes that they will not have to start all over again with the arrival of a new government. <p/> Papič also regrets that they are back at the point of two years ago, when the legislation was also practically in place, but after the elections the whole thing fell into the water. With a new minister, they have reached a point where a working group has already handed over a draft law on research to the ministry, but now the resignation of the government is putting the whole thing in doubt again. <p/> The rectors of the two Seaside universities are of a similar opinion. Kutnarjeva would like whoever takes office in the new government to accept the bulk of the law already drafted by the profession and send it for further consideration as soon as possible, while Zavrtanik regrets that they behaved somewhat neuralgically at the end of its coordination, since otherwise, with some pragmatic solutions, the law could perhaps have been in parliamentary procedure today. <p/> The Rectors also took note of a promotional video entitled Slovenia. Green. Creative. Smart, and they also addressed an initiative to the public agency Spirit to include in such films promoting the country in the future a presentation of its development potential, represented by the scientific and research work of universities and institutes.",News/Reporting,train
987,"info@dc-dlan.si <p/> 0590 80 616 <p/> CONTACT US <p/> What does gender theory teach? <p/> Gender theory is the latest ideology to emerge from the social sciences. <p/> At its core, it denies the existence of two natural identities (male identity and female identity), denies the differences between them and denies the natural attraction between male and female. (Proponents of gender theory argue that heterosexuality is a ""compulsion"" of society that dictates that sexual relations must be between two different sexes and, consequently, procreative). <p/> Gender theory primarily teaches that a person's gender is not determined by his or her genitals, but that the individual decides for him or herself what gender he or she will be. Thus, the ""true sex"" is only that which the individual feels in his or her mind. This realisation has given rise to a wide range of genders that is difficult to match. Not only can an individual change his or her gender, but he or she can also switch between them, invent a new gender or decide to be genderless or asexual. <p/> At the same time, gender theory does not recognise that the relationship between man and woman is unique. It claims that all sexual orientations and practices are the same. Thus, there is no difference between heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, asexuality or any other sexual experience or experience. <p/> Why is gender theory an ideology? Gender theory is not a scientific theory because it is completely divorced from the natural sciences. It also does not have a single author, but has been developed piecemeal over more than 60 years. It began to develop in the 1950s (through the Marxist feminist Simone de Beavuor) and then in the 1970s in the USA through the Women's Revolution, which coincided with the sexual revolution. In the 1990s it was radicalised by the feminist Judith Butler (and her followers), who still argues that gender identity is an illusion. According to her, even biological bodies are not a natural given, but shaped by culture, by society. <p/> Why did it all start with feminists? They were convinced that talking about masculinity and femininity and their differences leads to even more stereotypical thinking and to a deepening of masculine and feminine gender schemas, the result of which is the perpetuation of women's subordinate social position. <p/> Gender theory reached its global peak in 1995, when the UN adopted the new term 'gender' at the World Conference on Women in Beijing, thereby signaling that gender would no longer be spoken of as a stable natural given (biological sex) but as a merely unstable and fluid category (social sex) that has no pre-given essence or meaning. Today, gender identity is seen only as a deep inner sense of belonging to a gender that may or may not correspond to one's innate sex. <p/> This policy was launched by the UN 20 years ago and has infiltrated every pore of society: politics, the judiciary, the media, philanthropic and humanitarian organisations, schools and universities, music, art, film and literature. <p/> The various LGBT lobbies and influential NGOs in the main European institutions (ILGA at the European Commission and others) have played a major role in this revolution. <p/> When did the ideology start? <p/> Robert Stoller (1925-1992) of the University of California, Los Angeles, was the first to divide sexual identity into biological sex (sex) and social sex (gender). Humans are therefore defined by two dimensions: biology (chromosomes, hormones, external and internal sex organs, secondary sex characteristics) and the social-psychological expression of gender (sex roles, behaviour, actions, traits). <p/> The distinction between biological and social sex is not in itself false. It becomes ideological when social gender is assigned a dominant role in determining gender identity. <p/> Gender ideology began when theorists isolated biological sex from social sex. This separation made the two categories completely unrelated, without the influence of one on the other. <p/> The truth is that biological and social sex are interdependent, complementary and intimately linked within the developmental process. We cannot imagine a body that does not have a direct influence on the development of psychological sex and that is not reflected in concrete ways in society. From this point of view, social gender is not, under any circumstances, simply determined by society or ""taught"" from the outside. <p/> Science in the 1950s and gender theory <p/> Dr Money, who was a psychologist and sexologist, was developing a new theory of gender around 1970. His idea was based on the premise that a newborn baby is born psychosexually neutral and that by the age of three, it can be assigned either a male or a female sex. So, it is only parents and society that mould children into men and women. The biological component of sex - chromosomes, gonads, hormones, external and internal sex organs - is merely a kind of ""plastic"" that can be either overlooked (chromosomes) or altered at will. <p/> Dr Money, who was head of the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic, and his colleagues did not see the human being as a whole, whose psyche and physicality develop mutually, from conception onwards. The inextricable link between endocrinology and brain development and their influence on the development of the individual's psyche and behaviour was not a topic they wanted to explore. He preferred to calculate human components in his own way, believing that the psyche would adapt to newly imposed chemical and surgical changes if only education was persistent enough. <p/> A sad combination of circumstances brought a boy of less than two years of age to Moneye's practice, who at eight months was left without a sex organ after an accident. Dr Money, through prior indoctrination of his parents, had raised him as a girl. What has become apparent over the years has had a catastrophic effect on the psychosocial development of this boy and on his entire family. But since no one but the immediate family saw this, Dr Money used this case in books and professional articles as a successful example of the proof that biology is changeable and that nurture plays a key role in the formation of sexual identity. <p/> The growing women's movement in the USA, which had been fighting for decades against the biological basis of gender differences, saw in Money's theory a scientific explanation that the differences between men and women were the result of social expectations that had been shaped by a patriarchal pattern. <p/> Moneyev's theory and the feminist movement have virtually merged into one: man and woman are basically identical, having been born ""neutral"". All the visible differences between them (their gait, posture, tastes, interests, hobbies, the way they dress, speak, feel, relate; children's choice of games and toys, adults' choice of occupation, their roles in society and the family, etc.) are merely a matter of habituation, which can be overcome by a persistent revolutionary movement and through re-education. <p/> That Moneyev's theory does not hold water and that the Decalogue has been falsely presented as scientific was exposed in 1995 by Dr Milton Diamond. Investigative journalist, David Colapinto, wrote a high-profile article on the case in Rolling Stone magazine in 1997 and the world-famous bestseller Bruce, Brenda, David in 2000. The boy who was raised as a girl. <p/>What do scientists say today? <p/> Johns Hopkins Hospital, famous in the 1970s for its state-of-the-art sex theory, took a different course after Moneye's gradual withdrawal. After the arrival of Dr McHugh, an advocate of bringing sanity back into the profession, the Gender Identity Clinic, which had been surgically altering the sex of adult human beings, was closed down as early as 1979. <p/> Last August 2016, Dr McHugh, in collaboration with Dr Mayer, published the largest study in the field of sexuality and gender identity in the scientific journal The New Atlantis. Together, they worked on over 500 studies published from 1950 to the present day. They have taken a hard look at all the factors that have a major impact on the development of a person's sexual orientation and gender identity. They have paid a great deal of attention to mental health and the real difficulties experienced by non-heterosexual people and people who have problems with their sexual identity. <p/> With regard to sexual identity, they simply confirmed the fact that it cannot be independent of biological sex. Among all the studies examined, they found no scientific evidence to confirm that there is a physiological cause that determines a person's feeling of having been born in the wrong body. <p/> Furthermore, they found that adults who have undergone sex reassignment surgery continue to suffer from poor mental health. The scientists also found that so-called social stressors (discrimination, prejudice, stigmatisation) were not the main source of suffering, leading these people to experience fear, anxiety, isolation, alcoholism, drug abuse and suicidality (41%). Above all, they found that these are the ills that stem to the greatest extent from the person himself, from the conflict that he carries within himself. <p/> They also looked critically at attempts at sex reassignment in children. They have observed that a very small number of children who are overwhelmed by the feeling of being trapped in the wrong body when they are growing up will continue to have this opinion of themselves after they have grown up. For this reason, there is no evidence that children who exhibit atypical behaviour during puberty should be encouraged to undergo hormonal and surgical sex reassignment. <p/> Poor psychological health continues to be associated with people who suffer from discomfort in accepting their own bodies, and both doctors are working hard to help these patients in the best possible way. <p/> Gender theory in the school system <p/> Gender theory is already part of the regular curriculum in many countries. In Slovenia, the advocates of gender theory have also ensured that for more than a decade now, Slovenian public schools have also offered programmes called ""against homophobia"", ""against stereotypes"", ""against discrimination"", ""for inclusion of all"", ""for human rights"", etc. They are carried out in our country by various associations such as Amnesty International, the DiH Association, the Peace Institute, Legebitra, the TransAkcija Association, etc. <p/> Through debates, brochures, magazines and games, children are taught that there are several genders, that everyone has the right to determine their own gender and to experiment with their sexual orientation. <p/> Example: a few years ago, Amnesty International published the book Love is Love and disseminated its content in Slovenian primary and secondary schools. I quote a few sentences from the book, which show that it denigrates the traditional family, the role of dad and mum in bringing up children, promotes homosexuality and creates a great deal of confusion about sexual identity. <p/> ""Is the father figure always male?"" (p. 20) <p/> ""Is the mother figure something that is essentially tied to the female gender?"" (p.20) <p/> ""Let us remember that gender is something that we must have the right and the possibility to create ourselves and not according to the dictates of our genitals, which should force a person to be a woman or to be a man!"" (p.26) <p/> ""Being lesbian or gay, bisexual or transgender, intersex is normal and totally cool."" (p.39) <p/> Primary school children read books like ""My name is Damjan"" (about a girl who wants to be a boy), ""And with Tango there are three of us"" (about two penguins who get a daughter named Tango), etc. <p/> Changing the language of legislation <p/> ""Change the words and you will change the way society thinks"", wrote Lenin. Language became the main tool for achieving cultural change. Words like 'family', 'marriage', 'love', 'sex' take on a new, different, polysemous meaning; the words 'natural', 'normal', 'perverse' are removed. In certain countries (e.g. Switzerland, the canton of Bern), words with a more neutral sound have been introduced. <p/> The words ""father and mother"" and ""husband and wife"" are the most affected. They are taking away gender from these terms because they are convinced that society must not produce the herosexual family as the only example of a family. They therefore prefer to choose neutral terms where no one will be discriminated against and where all the symbolism of natural family ties will be erased and consequently irrelevant. <p/> Instead of ""father and mother"": <p/> ""parent 1"" and ""parent 2"" (Spain) <p/> ""genetic donor"" (Quebec Civil Code) <p/> Instead of ""husband and wife"" <p/> ""person 1"" and ""person 2"" (proposal for Slovenia, 2015)",Opinion/Argumentation,train

1000,"The debate often brings to the surface first those values that people in the kindergarten, school, organisation think they ""should"" have or ""should value"" in order to be respected as much as possible by themselves and the organisation. <p/> We know that the values people express publicly can be very different from the values they express in their own actions and behaviour. People's behaviour often seems to 'violate' values that they claim to hold important and sacred. Such ""double morality"" is a commonplace phenomenon, reflecting the disconnect between one's actual values, what one really values and cares about, and how one would like others to see one. <p/> If this phenomenon is so typical of human beings, it is logical that it cannot be avoided when discussing values within an organisation. Such a discussion often brings to the surface, in particular, the values that people feel they ""should"" have or ""should value"" in order to make themselves and the organisation as attractive and respected as possible. <p/> If the values that are written down do not match those that the organisation and its people express in their actions and behaviour, they cannot have a positive impact on employees and users. <p/> Just as the ""double morality"" of the individual is unattractive, the ""double morality"" of the organisation, or the wide gap between its stated values and what its actions express, is an ideal breeding ground for cynicism, sarcasm, ridicule and other negative phenomena. Written values that are literally at odds with what happens in the organisation cannot possibly have a positive impact on its employees and users. On the contrary, they often become a source of further dissatisfaction. It is therefore all the more important that the debate on the values of the organisation really goes deep, not contenting itself with superficial answers, and that it examines and tests the values it evokes. <p/> For example, if the debate points out that what matters most to employees is ""good relations with users"", it is important to ask whether this is really being implemented in practice. Does the day-to-day behaviour of the organisation and its people really reflect this concern? Do their actions and procedures really reflect this? <p/> In summary, it is useful to talk about, discuss, clarify and define values. But in doing so, organisations should be as careful as possible to avoid the tendency to ""sugarcoat"" the truth, to portray values ""as they should be"" rather than ""as they are"". Otherwise, the debate on values can quickly turn into its opposite, which instead of having positive consequences, encourages cynicism, sarcasm and dissatisfaction, and has a negative impact on employees' motivation, work zeal and morale.",Opinion/Argumentation,train
