1664	"Rossa Matilda Richter Zazel posing with her cannon , at the Royal Aquarium , in 1877 Rossa Matilda Richter ( 1863 – 1937 ) was a circus performer and actor ( stage name , Zazel ) who became the first recorded human cannonball in 1877 , at the age of 14 , launching herself from a spring-style "" cannon "" . Richter was a child actor and got into circus-style performances as a trapeze artist . On 10 April 1877 , she incorporated a new stunt , the human cannonball . The first such performance was at the Royal Aquarium in London when she was 14 . She was fired out of a spring-style cannon , traveling 6.1 metres ( 20 ft ) and landing in a net . According to the Guinness Book of World Records , Richter was the first human cannonball , though the distinction has been contested by others who claim Ella Zuila and George Loyal , also known as "" The Australian Marvels "" , performed the act a few years prior . The cannon was invented by William Leonard Hunt , a Canadian daredevil known as "" The Great Farini "" – U.S. Patent , No. 115 , 837 was issued on 13 June 1871 to "" William Farini , now of London , England certain new and useful Apparatus for Projecting Persons and Articles into or through the Air "" ; and , further , U.S. Patent , no . 214 , 663 was issued on 22 April 1879 to "" William Leonard Hunt , of Westminster and Improvement in Theater Appliances "" – and used rubber springs to limit the distance she would travel , employing a gunpowder - based explosion only for effect . According to P. T. Barnum , who had traveled to London to see the performance , Zazel pleaded with him to take her away . Though she was the star of the act and took the physical risks , Hunt was keeping most of the money the act brought in . Poster advertising one of Zazel's performances at the Royal Aquarium Richter went on tour with Barnum's Circus , performing in France and throughout the United States . She married Barnum's manager , George Oscar Starr ( 1849 – 1915 ) – later , manager of The Crystal Palace – she was his second wife . In 1891 , Richter nearly died in an accident during a show in New Mexico , when either the net was incorrectly placed ( causing her to miss it and hit the ground ) or the net catastrophically failed . She broke her back , effectively retiring her from her career as a human cannonball , and she spent several months in a suspended full body cast . Written in 1938 , by Robert Stevenson and Roland Pertwee , directed by Stevenson , and released in 1939 , the British comedy film Young Man's Fancy was centred on Ada , an Irish human cannonball . The character of Ada was written especially for Anna Lee by Stevenson , her husband , and is "" based on Zazel , the original ' human cannon ball ' , who thrilled London audiences in the nineties by being shot from a cannon "" – however , "" for the purposes of the film ... the period has been put back to the seventies ."	4
739	What we believe Christianity is relationship . It 's about who we believe in . The following beliefs shape our understanding of that relationship : We believe the Bible , the inspired Word of God , is completely trustworthy , speaking with supreme authority in all matters of belief and practice . We believe in one God , who exists eternally in three persons , the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit We believe all people , being created in the image of God , have intrinsic value , but as a result of sin are alienated from God and each other , and therefore in need of reconciliation . We believe that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , born of the virgin Mary , is fully God and fully human ; He demonstrated God's love for sinners by suffering the penalty of death in their place , rose bodily from the dead and ascended to heaven where He intercedes for His people . We believe all who repent and trust in Jesus Christ alone as Lord and Saviour are , by the grace of God , declared to be right with Him , receiving forgiveness and eternal life . We believe the Lord Jesus Christ will return personally in glory , raise the dead , and judge the world . We believe all people will rise from the dead , those who are in Christ to enjoy eternal life with God , and those who are lost to suffer eternal separation from Him . We believe in the Holy Spirit who imparts new life to those who believe in Christ ; through His indwelling presence and transforming power He gives assurance and equips believers for holy living and effective service . We believe the Church is the body of Christ , the fellowship of all believers , and is commissioned to make disciples of all nations .	0

Classical Thermodynamics : The second law In this section , we start from the experimental fact that heat engines are never 100 % efficient , and also that there is a natural direction to spontaneous processes ( such as the cooling of a cup of coffee ) , and derive the existence of a new function of state , entropy . In classical thermodynamics , entropy '' completes the set '' of relevant thermodynamic variables and , starting with the fundamental thermodynamic relation and using Maxwell's relations , enables us to work out what is happening to systems during a variety of processes .

4	"China's Cyber-Warriors NEW DELHI – The world now accepts that protecting our atmosphere , hydrosphere , lithosphere , and biosphere – the "" global commons "" – is the responsibility of all countries . The same norm must apply to cyberspace , which is critical to our everyday life , economic well-being , and security . At a time when cyber attacks are increasing worldwide , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was right to declare that an attack on one nation's computer networks "" can be an attack on all . "" Indeed , the attacks are a reminder that , as a new part of the global commons , cyberspace already has come under threat . Cyberspace must be treated , along with outer space , international waters , and international airspace , as property held in common for the good of all . And , like ocean piracy and airplane hijacking , cyber-crime can not be allowed to go unpunished if we are to safeguard our common assets and collective interests . Naming China among a handful of countries that have stepped up Internet censorship , Clinton warned that "" a new information curtain is descending across much of the world . "" Her statement , with its allusion to the Cold War-era Iron Curtain , amounted to an implicit admission that the central assumption guiding US policy on China since the 1990's – that assisting China's economic rise would usher in greater political openness there – has gone awry . The strategy of using market forces and the Internet to open up a closed political system simply is not working . Indeed , the more economic power China has accumulated , the more adept it has become in extending censorship to cyberspace . If anything , China has proven that a country can blend control , coercion , and patronage to stymie the Internet 's politically liberalizing elements . Through discreet but tough controls , Beijing pursues a policy of wai song , nei jin – relaxed on the outside , vigilant internally . Google is now crying foul over "" a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China . "" But , despite its corporate motto – "" Do n't be evil "" – Google itself was instrumental in aiding online censorship in China , having custom-built a search engine that purges all references and Web sites that the Chinese government considers inappropriate . Now Google itself has become a victim of China's growing cyber prowess , in the same way that appeasement of Hitler boomeranged onto France and Britain . China deploys tens of thousands of "" cyber police "" to block Web sites , patrol cyber-cafes , monitor the use of cellular telephones , and track down Internet activists . But the threat to the new global commons comes not from what China does domestically . Rather , it comes from the way in which the know-how that China has gained in fashioning domestic cyber oversight is proving invaluable to it in its efforts to engage in cyber intrusion across its frontiers . Canadian researchers have discovered a vast Chinese surveillance system called "" GhostNet , "" which can compromise computers in organizations abroad through booby-trapped e-mail messages that automatically scan and transfer documents to a digital storage facility in China . This is what happened when computers of the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala , India , were attacked last year . India's national security adviser recently complained that his office was targeted yet again by hackers . "" People seem to be fairly sure it was the Chinese , "" he said . Officials in Germany , Britain , and the US have acknowledged that hackers believed to be from China also have broken into their government and military networks . The state-sponsored transnational cyber threat is at two levels . The first is national , with the hackers largely interested in two objectives . One is to steal secrets and gain an asymmetrical advantage over another country . Cyber intrusion in peacetime allows the prowler to read the content and understand the relative importance of different computer networks so that it knows what to disable in a conflict situation . The other objective is commercial : to pilfer intellectual property . The second level of cyber threat is against chosen individuals . The most common type of intrusion is an attempt to hack into e-mail accounts . The targets also can face Trojan-horse attacks by e-mail intended to breach their computers and allow the infiltrators to corrupt or transfer files remotely . To be sure , if a cyber attack is camouflaged , it is not easy to identify the country from which it originated . Through the use of so-called "" false-flag espionage "" and other methods , attacks can be routed through the computers of a third country . Just as some Chinese pharmaceutical firms exported to Africa spurious medicines with "" Made in India "" labels – a fact admitted by the Chinese government – some Chinese hackers are known to have routed their cyber intrusion through computers in Russia , Iran , Cuba , and other countries . But , like their comrades in the pharmaceutical industry , such hackers tend to leave telltale signs . Then there are many cases in which the attacks have originated directly from China . It seems unlikely that these hackers , especially those engaged in cyber espionage , pilferage , and intimidation , are private individuals with no links to the Chinese government . It is more likely that they are tied to the People's Liberation Army . In war , this irregular contingent of hackers would become the vanguard behind which the PLA takes on the enemy . Systematic cyber attacks constitute a new frontier of asymmetrical warfare at a time when the world already confronts other unconventional threats , including transnational terrorism . With national security and prosperity now dependent on the safekeeping of cyberspace , cybercrime must be effectively countered as an international priority . If not , cyberspace will become the new global-commons battlefield ."	0
281	"In producing a signlist and analysing its contents , it is obviously very important to consider the question of what actually constitutes a "" sign "" . Much has changed since the traditional Assyriological signlists were first produced , both in Assyriology and in the description and analysis of writing and writing systems in general . The minimal unit of written language - and this applies equally to logo-syllabic scripts such as cuneiform as it does to alphabetic scripts - is the grapheme . One might describe this as the smallest contrastive unit of writing . By substituting one such unit for another , a significant change in meaning ( using the term in its broad sense ) occurs . Grapheme is not an unproblematic term ( notice , for instance , that there is no one-to-one relationship between graphemes and phonemes ) but it is both defensible and useful , as far as the present study of cuneiform is concerned , at least . There are many and various indications of what ancient scribes considered units in cuneiform ; in light of these , a set of criteria is being drawn up to allow the identification of signs . The CDP project will catalogue and analyse these units , these graphemes . Thus for the signlist , the sign is a grapheme . There are two further levels at which cuneiform signs can be described . Graphemes may appear in several different , yet equally valid , forms ; these are labelled allographs . Each instance - the actual mark or set of marks one sees in the clay - is an example of an allograph of a grapheme ; these are labelled graphs . To illustrate the difference between graph , allograph and grapheme , consider alphabetic writing . Readers of alphabetic writing , as they look at what they are reading , see a long string of graphs . Effortlessly they identify each graph as a valid instance of a particular letter or mark of punctuation , that is , as a depiction of a grapheme . Even in the highly controlled graphic environment of print there is still a lot of allographic variation : the grapheme / a / , for instance , may be a roman ' a ' or an italic ' a ' , ( in most typefaces a completely different form ) . All of these are recognised without hesitation by skilled readers as being different versions of the same thing , allographs of the grapheme / a / , and therefore , in our alphabetic script , inviting the same range of phonological realisation . We see those different graphic shapes , and in our head appears the noise ' a ' or ' ay ' or whatever else the context dictates . For a more detailed discussion , see the terminology section . In the study of cuneiform , work has been concentrated at the graphemic level . Great efforts have been made to identify the cuneiform signs , and there are standard lists that name and illustrate them . But little work has been done at the allographic level , which is the level of a truly useful sign list , nor at the graphic level , the level at which the identifying characteristics of individual scribes are to be found . The reasons for this are partly"	3

1523	"When it comes to new TLD applications , there are two types : A "" community-based designation "" application , in which the applicant promises to operate its proposed new TLD for the benefit of a "" clearly designated community "" ; and A standard application . Successful "" standard "" applicants may use the new TLD in any manner consistent with general requirements and criteria , but are not otherwise constrained in the way that successful "" community-based designation "" registries will be . The four applicants seeking to be registries of . RADIO are BRS Media ( BRS ) , Affilias Limited ( Afilias ) and Tin Dale , LLC ( Tin Dale ) – each of which submitted "" standard "" applications – and Eurovision Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) – which seeks special status as a "" community-based designation . "" Let 's take a look at each . BRS , a "" media e-commerce company "" , based in San Francisco , is owned and operated by George Bundy . In 1998 , when the Internet was young , Bundy and BRS embarked on an innovative plan to affiliate with two country codes , the Federated States of Micronesia ( assigned . FM as its country code ) and Armenia ( assigned . AM ) . With permission of those countries , BRS began offering . AM and . FM domain names and email addresses to broadcasters . Now BRS wants to add . RADIO to its portfolio . Inc. magazine website lists BRS as one of the "" 5 , 000 fastest-growing private companies "" in the U.S. Afilias is a well-known TLD operator and service provider in the Internet Community . Incorporated in Dublin , it runs a large office in Philadelphia and has operations in Toronto and New Delhi . Afilias is the registry of the . INFO and . MOBI top level domains . It also provides "" back-end services "" to enable the technical operations of other TLDs ( . ORG , . ASIA , . AERO ( for airline and aviation )) and some country codes ( e.g. , . MN ( Mongolia ) , . AG ( Antigua and Barbuda ) and . BZ ( Belize )) . Directly or through affiliates , Afilias has applied for 31 new top level domains , including . BLOG , . WEB and . POKER , along with . RADIO . Tin Dale is an affiliate of Donuts , Inc. , and named for one of the company's founders , Richard Tindal . Donuts , a 2010 Delaware corporation , lists its offices as Bellevue , Washington , and was founded by leaders of the Registrar community ( entities , such as eNom , which sell domain names ) . Donuts raised $ 100 million in venture capital and applied for a whopping 307 TLDs , including . SHOP , . COMPUTER AND . FILM , in addition to . RADIO . European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) describes itself as a "" well-known professional association of national broadcasters that negotiates and advocates for interests of public broadcasters in Europe . "" Created in 1950 and based in Switzerland , it is chartered as a not-for-profit association and an international non-governmental organization . It is also one of 700 + "" sector members "" of the International Telecommunications Union , which advise the ITU on technical standards . In its application , each applicant is required to describe the mission and purpose of the proposed TLD as envisioned by the applicant . On that point the various applicants ' respective proposed uses of . RADIO have a similar ring : BRS would "" provide all those interested , worldwide , in disseminating or seeking information , whether non-commercial or commercial , issues , news , culture , lifestyle , entertainment , sports or any other topic with a convenient & recognizable domain name that associate them and / or their information with On Air & Online ( net ) Radio . "" Afilias proposes "" an Internet space which will become the easily recognizable gathering place for existing and planned radio stations and podcasters to create trusted and easily accessible online content , and ease of access for people searching for specific topics or radio formats . "" According to Tin Dale , the . RADIO TLD would be "" attractive and useful to end-users as it better facilitates search , self-expression , information sharing and the provision of legitimate goods and services . . . . This TLD is a generic term and its second level names will be attractive to a variety of Internet users . "" EBU would operate . RADIO "" on behalf of the global Radio community , in order to provide it with a trusted and secure name space to facilitate its transformation into the next generation radio industry . "" Despite any similarities , though , the offering of the domain names – a process ICANN calls the "" roll-out "" – would be quite different , depending on which of the four applicants prevails . Afilias , Tin Dale , and BRS all propose "" open registrations "" which would allow any company , organization or individual to register its second-level domains within . RADIO , for a fee . The EBU application , by contrast , promises a much more restrictive registration policy . Its initial registration period would be limited to existing broadcasters , trademark owners and others already engaged in "" radio "" - related activities . Specifically , EBU will consider the "" radio community "" to be : 7 . Above categories for expanded name selection when not protected by trademarks . Who will ICANN award the . RADIO TLD to ? In most TLD contests , ICANN's policies provide for an auction . However , the . RADIO situation is different . As noted , EBU opted for a "" community-based designation "" to represent and serve the worldwide community of radio broadcasters . This choice exposes EBU's application to close scrutiny by ICANN's special evaluation panel , but offers potentially high rewards . If EBU's application survives that scrutiny , its community application will take priority over other competing applications . No auction – . RADIO will be awarded to EBU . But while EBU will allow US broadcasters to register in the . RADIO top level domain , is the EBU -- and the governance it will be bring to . RADIO domain names and policies -- truly serving , and representative of , the worldwide broadcasting community ? According to ICANN's Applicant Guidebook , a community-based applicant must "" substantiate its status as representative of the community it names in the application by submission of written endorsements in support of the application "" . All of EBU's members submitted letters of support , as did the Association for International Broadcasting and other international groups . But interestingly , the National Association of Broadcasters did not send a letter of endorsement and is not listed as supporting the application . This absence raises questions . Is EBU the best representative of the U.S. broadcasting community ? Will EBU serve U.S. and world broadcasters fairly and equally ? These are key questions for U.S. broadcasters to be asking as soon as possible – and sharing their answers promptly with ICANN ."	0

445	"Scrap the education white paper Stop all the academies and defend comprehensive education by Ken Muller , assistant secretary Islington NUT ( pc ) Far more is at stake for the future of education than the fate of the hapless Ruth Kelly . New Labour's White Paper on schools signals a thoroughgoing assault on the principle of comprehensive education . The planned education bill based on it would lead to all schools being encouraged to break from local democratic control and turn themselves into semi-independent trusts . Such is the scale of the mounting opposition that the government now appears to fear that it will be able to get the bill through parliament only by relying on Tory votes . Senior New Labour figures said this week that Tony Blair is looking to delay publishing the bill , which was due next month , until he has been able to buy off backbench opposition . Labour backbenchers have already produced an "" alternative White Paper "" . But leading rebels have also said they are prepared to compromise . The city academy programme , which takes schools completely out of public control and hands them over to businessmen , is already law . New Labour's weakness and the rising opposition of parents mean the programme could be derailed . But that will not come by relying on MPs who voted for academies before . A possible compromise being floated over the new bill is that groups of schools could become a trust , rather than individual ones . But what 's so great about a cluster of schools in competition with another group for scarce resources ? Teacher union activists in London have called a protest march over the education proposals for 2 March . Other initiatives are taking place elsewhere across the country . © Copyright Socialist Worker ( unless otherwise stated ) .

1644	"Victor Englebert / Photo Researchers Like hiking ? Then come and explore the plants and animals of seven of the world's major mountain ranges ! From the towering Himalayas to the austere Atlas Mountains , mountain ecosystems are chock full of interesting organisms . Often considered biological hotspots , many of these regions feature life forms with amazing adaptations to enable survival in rugged terrain and extreme weather conditions . Learn more about montane flora and fauna with this quick tour through a variety of mountains across the globe . Great Dividing Range Ron Dorman – Bruce Coleman Inc. A hike along Australia's Great Dividing Range would reveal a series of plateaus and low mountain ranges roughly paralleling the coasts of Queensland , New South Wales , and Victoria . The mountain range extends some 2,300 miles ( 3 , 700 km ) from the Cape York Peninsula , Queensland , to the Grampians in Victoria Bass Strait between Australia and Tasmania . In Queensland , the mountains average is 2,000 – 3 , 000 feet ( 600 – 900 meters ) in elevation , but they rise as high as 5,000 feet ( 1 , 500 meters ) in the Bellenden Ker and McPherson ranges and the Lamington Plateau . Farther south , a segment known as the Australian Alps , near the New South Wales – Victoria border , contains Australia's highest peak , Mount Kosciuszko ( 7 , 310 feet ) . Since the Great Dividing Range is not very high compared to other mountain ranges , few animals specifically adapted to mountainous environments occur there . Tree kangaroos and bird-wing butterflies occur in the rainforests of the mountainous northeast . Some bird species , such as the galah and the Australian magpie are found throughout Australia . Much of the Great Dividing Range is defined by forested areas of acacias , eucalyptus ( see photo ) , and casuarinas , with hummock grasses and flowering plants , including banksias , in the undergrowth . The vegetation on the western slopes is predominately subtropical or temperate woodlands of eucalyptus and scrub . The Wollemi pine is a "" living fossil "" that was discovered in Wollemi National Park in 1994 . Ethiopian Highlands Although Ethiopia's complex relief defies easy classification , of the five topographic regions in the country only two ( the Western Highlands and the Eastern Highlands ) might be classified as mountain ecosystems . The most spectacular portion is the North Central massifs in the Western Highlands ; these form the roof of Ethiopia , the highest being Mount Ras Dejen at 14,872 feet ( 4 , 533 meters ) . Lake Tana ( see photo ) – Ethiopia's largest inland lake and the main reservoir for the Blue Nile River – is located in this region , at an elevation of about 6,000 feet ( 1 , 800 meters ) . Another region , the Western Lowlands , are not what one would call low . They stretch north-south along the border with Sudan and South Sudan and include the lower valleys of the Blue Nile , Tekeze , and Baro rivers . With elevations of about 3,300 feet ( 1 , 000 meters ) , these "" lowlands "" are some of the hottest places on the planet . Several familiar African mammals live in Ethiopia , such as lions , leopards , elephants , giraffes , rhinoceroses , and wild buffalo , but these species rarely venture into the mountains . Uniquely Ethiopian mountain-dwelling species include the walia ibex of the Simien Mountains , the mountain nyala ( a kind of antelope ) , the Simien jackal , and the gelada monkey . These creatures are endangered , and they appear in both the Western and Eastern highlands in numbers ranging from a few hundred for the walia ibex to a few thousand for the others . The primary vegetation types of the Ethiopian Highlands are moorland , grassland , and herb meadow . While much of the region is predominantly grass and heathland , a number of other plants are also characteristic . Punctuating the landscape is the lovely Rosa abyssinica , an endemic rose bush that towers up to 6.5 feet ( 2 meters ) high . The kosso tree is used in traditional medicine as a vermifuge , and the wild African olive tree is found in many places throughout the range . One of the most unusual species is the giant lobelia , which reaches a height of 20 feet ( 6 meters ) when flowering . Himalayas Steven Powers / The Wildlife Collection For thousands of years the Himalayas have held a profound significance for the peoples of South Asia , as their literature , mythologies , and religions reflect . Since ancient times the vast glaciated heights have attracted the attention of the pilgrim mountaineers of India , who coined the Sanskrit name Himalaya – from hima ( "" snow "" ) and alaya ( "" abode "" ) – for this great mountain system . In contemporary times the Himalayas have offered the greatest attraction and the greatest challenge to mountaineers throughout the world . The Himalayas have more than 110 peaks rising to elevations of 24,000 feet ( 7 , 300 meters ) or more above sea level , including Kanchenjunga at the border of India ( Sikkim state ) and Nepal ( see photo ) . One of these peaks is Mount Everest ( Tibetan : Chomolungma ; Chinese : Qomolangma Feng ; Nepali : Sagarmatha ) , the world's highest , with an elevation of 29,035 feet ( 8 , 850 meters ) . The fauna of the eastern Himalayas is similar to that of the southern Chinese and Southeast Asian region . The animal life of the western Himalayas , however , have more in common with the Mediterranean , Ethiopian , and Turkmenian regions . Elephants and rhinoceroses are restricted to parts of the forested Tarai region – moist or marshy areas , now largely drained – at the base of the low hills in southern Nepal . Asiatic black bears , clouded leopards , langurs ( a long-tailed Asian monkey ) , and Himalayan goat antelopes ( e.g. , the tahr ) are some of the denizens of the Himalayan forests . In the foothills one may find the Indian rhinoceros , musk deer , and the Kashmir stag ( hangul ) , but in small numbers . In remote sections of the Himalayas , at higher elevations , snow leopards , brown bears , lesser pandas , and Tibetan yaks have limited populations . Above the tree line the most numerous animals , however , are diverse types of insects , spiders , and mites , which are the only animal forms that can live as high up as 20,700 feet ( 6 , 300 meters ) . The Himalayas are rich in floral biodiversity . On the western side of the range , the lower shrublands are defined by beautiful rhododendrons and meadows of grasses . In the eastern region , broadleaf forests receive almost 80 inches ( 200 centimeters ) of annual rainfall and feature indigenous oaks and maples with orchids and ferns in the understory . As one ascends the mountains , the temperate sub-alpine conifer forests dominate the landscape with pine , hemlock , spruce , and fir . The Himalayan balsam and other small , flowering plants can be found above the treeline in the alpine regions . Atlas Mountains Tom McHugh / Photo Researchers The Atlas system is a series of mountain ranges in northwestern Africa that run generally southwest to northeast across Morocco , Algeria , and Tunisia . They extend for more than 1,200 miles ( 2 , 000 kilometers ) from the Moroccan port of Agadir in the southwest to the Tunisian capital of Tunis in the northeast . Mount Toubkal at 13,665 feet ( 4 , 165 meters ) is the highest point in the Atlas Mountains . Other imposing peaks in the Atlas include Mount Tidirhine at 8,058 feet ( 2 , 456 meters ) , the rugged bastion of the Ouarsenis Massif ( which reaches a height of 6,512 feet ) , the Great Kabylie , which reaches 7,572 feet ( 2 , 308 meters ) at the peak of Lalla Khedidja , and Mount Chelia ( 7 , 638 feet ) . Much of the land in the Atlas has been cleared for agriculture , and a small fraction of the forest cover remains . Animal life in the mountains is also in retreat . There remain only a few jackals , a few tribes of monkeys ( Barbary macaques , the only African ape found north of the Sahara ) at higher elevations , and occasional herds of wild boars in the oak woods – found in the northern part of the range . With low rainfall and high rates of soil erosion , the Atlas Mountains are fairly sparsely vegetated . The areas with the highest rainfall feature moist forests of cork oaks with an undergrowth of arbutus ( cane apple ) and heather shrubs dotted with carpets of rockroses and lavender . Dry regions are populated with green oak and arborvitae ( a species of pine tree ) which form light , dry forests with a thin and bushy undergrowth . Stands of cedar dominate the higher altitudes , though the dry summits are often reduced to scattered stands of green oak and juniper trees . 1 Rocky Mountains Donnie Sexton / Travel Montana The Rocky Mountains are a massive cordillera made up of more than 100 separate mountain ranges stretching from Alberta and British Columbia to New Mexico . The spectacular vistas of the Rockies , such as St. Mary's Lake in Montana's Glacier National Park ( see photo ) , have inspired countless mountain climbers , explorers , and even songwriters ; John Denver wrote his famous anthem "" Rocky Mountain High "" about these uplands in 1972 . Among the large mammals emblematic of the rugged backcountry are the black bear , grizzly bear , mountain lion , and wolverine . Bighorn sheep and mountain goats inhabit the high crags in summer and migrate to the lower slopes for the winter months . Members of the deer family , such as the caribou , elk ( wapiti ) , mule deer , and white-tailed deer also migrate between alpine meadows and subalpine forests ; the solitary moose lumbers across northern lakes , streams , and marshy areas , feeding on willow foliage and aquatic plants . Wolves , brought to near extinction by human predation , remain rare but have resurged since 1970 as their importance in the wilderness ecosystem has come to be appreciated . Smaller mammals of the lower elevations include the least chipmunk , red squirrel , Columbian ground squirrel , black-footed ferret , and marmot . Far below the tree line , one can walk amongst beautiful forests dominated by ponderosa pines and quaking aspen . Ascend a bit higher and the forests change to subalpine spruces and firs that get progressively more gnarled and stunted with the increase in elevation . Above the tree line , one will find alpine meadows of small , herbaceous plants that are hardier than their appearance would have you believe . These include blue columbine , snow buttercup , and pink phlox ."	4
1132	' Hacksaw Ridge ' Review : Mel Gibson Returns With a War Movie About Peace The controversial actor-filmmaker makes a violent , bloody WWII about conscientious objector Desmond T. Doss – and attempts an atonement ' Hacksaw Ridge ' is Mel Gibson's brilliant , bloody biopic about a WWII pacifist – Peter Travers on why you need to see it come hell or high water . ' Hacksaw Ridge ' Review : Mel Gibson Returns With a War Movie About Peace More News Mel Gibson is back , directing the bloody hell out of a war movie about ... peace . You may have issues with the star's past history of anger and intolerance . But you 'll have no issue with Hacksaw Ridge , a movie about a different kind of brave heart . It 's the fact-based , World War II story of Private First Class Desmond T. Doss , the first conscientious objector to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor . Andrew Garfield , in the best performance of his career to date , plays Desmond , a feisty kid out of Virginia's Blue Ridge mountains who swears never to pick up a gun ( he almost killed his daddy with one ) and swears just as vehemently to go into combat as a medic . How does this cornstalk-skinny pacifist , a devoted Seventh-Day Adventist , enter the front lines where you shoot to kill just to stay alive ? Related Hollywood pariah returns with this story of real-life WWII conscientious objector That 's the heart of the film that Gibson directs with no-bull sincerity from a script by Robert Schenkkan ( The Pacific ) and Andrew Knight that digs past clichés to touch a raw nerve . Desmond's father , Tom ( a superb Hugo Weaving ) , is so traumatized by his service in World War I that he forbids his sons to enlist . The boys , who 've have no problem defying Dad when he drunkenly abuses their mother , Bertha ( Rachel Griffiths ) , defy him again . Desmond's brother Hal ( Nathaniel Buzolic ) enlists soon after the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor . And our hero , though crazy in love with Dorothy ( the excellent Teresa Palmer ) , a nurse at the hospital where he gets medical schooling , is determined to follow . Basic training takes on new layers of meaning as Desmond shirks no duty , except for rifle practice . That decision angers both Sgt. Howell ( Vince Vaughn , doing gruff ) and the fellow recruits , who mistake his principles for cowardice . Attempts are made to drive this renegade out of the Army , even using the threat of court-martial . Desmond's dad turns up in an unexpected defense of his son . It 's a tribute to Garfield's total commitment to the role that he never lets easy sentiment color the force of the character's convictions . Not surprisingly , it 's the scenes of battle that send Hacksaw Ridge roaring to life , with Gibson and cinematographer Simon Duggan refusing to flinch from the harsh realities of ground warfare . The rocky slope from which the film takes its title is the Japanese stronghold that Desmond's battalion must destroy before they can take Okinawa . Gibson captures the most brutal and bloody screen carnage since his own Braveheart and the opening sequence of Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan . And it 's here that Desmond , staying behind as his troops are forced to pull out , repeatedly returns amid bullets , bombs and grenade blasts , to round up wounded soldiers , 75 in all , and lower them by rope down the ridge and to safety . Thanks to some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed , Gibson once again shows his staggering gifts as a filmmaker , able to juxtapose savagery with aching tenderness . There 's always been more than an adrenaline rush in his work : Look at Braveheart ( for which he won the Oscar as best director ) , The Passion of the Christ ( the most successful R-rated indie film of all-time ) and the masterful , misunderstood Apocalypto , released a decade ago – i.e. , roughly about the time LA cops got him on a DUI and his rants put him in the public doghouse . Hacksaw Ridge is being touted as Gibson's comeback . Is it also an atonement ? Who can say ? What 's clear is that Gibson has made a film about family , faith , love and forgiveness all put the test in an arena of violent conflict – a movie you do n't want to miss .

260	Web Journal of Current Legal Issues in association with Blackstone Press Ltd Bruce Grant and Mike Allen , University of Newcastle upon Tyne http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk / The Web Journal of Current Legal Issues is the first United Kingdom general law journal to be published purely electronically using World Wide Web . The journal is refereed and published bi-monthly . The first issue was mounted on the Web on 17 March 1995 and the second issue will be mounted in mid-May . Notes for Contributors may be obtained directly from the journal site or from Mike Allen at Newcastle Law School . The journal is the brainchild of Mike Allen and Bruce Grant of Newcastle Law School , at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne . Mike is the journal's editor and drew together a strong Editorial Board of fourteen members from a number of law schools around the country comprising a Committee of seven members responsible for the editing of the journal supported by seven advisory members . Refereed electronic journals have received recognition from HEFCE for the purposes of the next Research Assessment Exercise , the approach of which has helped generate material for the journal . The journal is published in association with Blackstone Press who are under-writing the venture and who will publish the Blackstone Yearbook of Current Legal Issues which will contain all the articles which appear in the journal . Design and presentation of the journal has been the responsibility of Bruce Grant . Contributions are accepted in data form only , whether by e-mail or on disk . After assessment by the relevant member of the editorial committee and refereeing , the contribution is marked up with HTML tags for browsing on the Web and also converted to rich text format to facilitate printing . The use of postcript files for printing was considered , and may yet be adopted in addition to rtf , but on the whole rtf was felt to be the more commonly acceptable format . Because the journal is first published electronically , it has not been thought sensible to provide page numbers . Traditionally a page-count has been used as a rough measure of the length of articles , but perhaps , as e-journals become established , a word-count will be seen as a better , and universally applicable method of comparison . One of the major advantages of electronic publishing is that articles and comments accepted for publication will be published promptly in the next issue as an electronic law journal does not suffer from space constraints . Too often , long delays between submission of articles and their publication has served to rob many of their topicality and much of their potential impact . This factor of speed of publication has helped provide the focus for the journal which is on current legal issues in judicial decisions , law reform , legislation , legal research , policy related socio-legal research , legal education , information technology and practice . While the focus of the journal is on current legal issues in the United Kingdom ( including European Union matters ) , the editors are keen to receive contributions which adopt a comparative approach . The editors are also keen to encourage academic debate and will welcome responses to articles or comments previously published . Undoubtedly electronic publishing will increase in the future as the potential of the medium is realised . In the first issue of the journal a taster of this potential was provided in an article by Robin Widdison , Director of the Centre for Law and Computing at the University of Durham , which contained links to other sites on the Internet . As more materials are published in this way such links will become more frequent and will totally alter the way in which we write articles or , for that matter , read them .

450	Gentleman Jim , the greatest Blue of all He was one of the great names in football during the game's golden age after World War Two when crowds flocked back to soccer in their millions . Born in Alton 1925 , Dickinson joined Pompey from Alton Youth Club . After three years in the Royal Navy , he made his league debut against Blackburn Rovers at Fratton Park in 1946 . He established the number six shirt as his own and helped steer Pompey to successive league championships . And a total of 48 appearances for England made him Pompey's most capped player of all time . He played 764 league games for Pompey - a record for one player at a single club which was not broken until Swindon's John Trollope went six better in 1980 . Dickinson was a gentleman both on and off the pitch . He was never booked or sent off in 800 Pompey and England matches . Dickinson was a Pompey stalwart for almost 20 years . Awarded the MBE in 1964 , he played his last match for the Blues a year later , helping Pompey to a 1-1 end-of-season draw at Northampton that secured safety from relegation .

1128	Mona Hatoum Gabriel Coxhead reviews the French artist's Tate Modern retrospective In 1975 , while Mona Hatoum was briefly visiting London from her native Beirut , the Lebanese Civil War broke out , preventing her from returning home for several years . This is the oft-repeated foundational myth of Hatoum's career ( she now lives and works in London and Berlin ) , the spur for the core concerns that recur throughout her mostly impressive body of work : ideas to do with violence and displacement , borders and contested territories , and the problematic notion of homeland ( a concept from which , being from a Palestinian family exiled in Lebanon , she was , after all , doubly distant ) . The dominant mood of Hatoum's works , accordingly , is one of unease , dislocation , danger . Domestic objects appear sinisterly transformed – as in the paired works Paravent ( French for ' folding screen ' ) and Daybed ( both 2008 ) , which take the form of nightmarishly enlarged , horribly sharp-looking cheesegraters ; or the scores of metal household-goods , in the installation Homebound ( 2000 ) , through which an electric current passes , powering bare lightbulbs and emitting a malevolent crackling sound . In Light Sentence ( 1992 ) , meanwhile , another naked bulb dangles amidst an enclosure of metal-mesh lockers , its mechanical pivoting sending grids of shadows skittering and stretching about the gallery walls , creating a disorientating , vaguely sickening effect . Such works must be among the most instantly familiar in recent British art , but are no less thrillingly effective for that . Less well known , though , and where this retrospective really comes into its own , are Hatoum's early performance pieces . Documented through text , photographs and occasional video , and scattered throughout the nonchronological display , these show Hatoum developing her focus on the body – typically her own – as a metaphor for political oppression and isolation : whether trapped inside a transparent container , slathered and slipping in liquid clay ( Under Siege , 1982 ) or lying motionless for hours on a table , wrapped in plastic sheeting and smeared with bloody viscera , as a soundtrack plays politicians' facile statements about the Lebanese peace process ( The Negotiating Table , 1983 ) . Yet perhaps most interesting , in view of her subsequent work , are a pair of film / performance pieces from 1980 , made while she was a student , in which live footage of herself and audience members is mixed with prerecorded segments of naked body parts or X-ray imagery , as if the roving camera was somehow capable of seeing through layers of clothing and skin . These themes of surveillance and trespass would culminate in what is arguably Hatoum's most captivating work , Corps Étranger ( 1994 ) . Filmed using an endoscopic camera , it makes for almost literally absorbing viewing , as you peer down into footage projected as a circle on the floor , scanning across her body 's seemingly gigantic surface before plunging deep into glistening , peristaltically pulsing cavities . The mixed sense of invasion and invitation is both discomfiting and compelling , as Hatoum's figure is portrayed as a kind of hinterland , a liminal territory between known externalities and alien-looking , interior zones . Her work of recent years , unfortunately , mostly does n't have the same impact . She still has a great way with small , cogent , ephemeral pieces : little weavings made from hair , or altered paper maps . But on a larger scale , the visual metaphors often tend to come off as rather heavy-handed . Hot Spot III ( 2009 ) , a giant globe with the country outlines drawn in blazing neon , is a comment on the globalised nature of political conflict . Cellules ( 2012 – 13 ) is an array of prison containers with amoebalike glass globules trapped inside – both are forms of cells , geddit ? The same essential ideas , it seems , are being recycled , but to diminishing effect , as Hatoum apparently settles into exploring what for her is that most ironic of concepts – familiar territory . This article was first published in the October 2016 issue of ArtReview .	5
1233	"Aereo catches over-the-air TV material that 's show completely free and flows it to users' pcs and devices for a regular monthly subscription fee . TV and show companies have actually been combating Aereo tooth and nail , and recently they petitioned the Supreme Court to quit Aereo in its tracks . Last night , it was revealed that the NFL and MLB submitted an amicus short last week urging the High court to agree journalists against Aereo . ' Technical chicanery ' The disagreement versus Aereo is in part that content copyright owners must license networks and journalists to re-transmit their programming , however Aereo asserts its streaming material is not technically a re-broadcast . The business contends it 's actually an exclusive program since each client's content is transmitted independently . Journalists do n't see it in this way , and the NFL and MLB see Aereo as a threat to their business design . "" If copyright holders shed their unique retransmission licensing rights and the substantial benefits derived from those rights when they put programming on broadcast terminals , those terminals will certainly come to be less eye-catching mediums for dispersing copyrighted content , "" the organizations' attorneys filled in the amicus short . And here 's the not-so-thinly-veiled threat : "" The alternative for copyright holders will be to relocate that content to paid cable networks ( such as ESPN and TNT ) where Aereo-like firms could not hijack and exploit their programs without permission , "" the brief continued . The MLB and NFL focused on the federal implications of this instance , and clarified that together they account for about $ ONE HUNDRED thousand of the $ 300 thousand that broadcasters gather in licensing fees general . "" The court's interference is now essential to bring back quality and surety around and to avoid the unraveling of marketplace created after the licensing of civil liberties instead of the expropriation of such rights via technological chicanery , "" their mission stated , with potentially the best-ever use of the word "" chicanery . "" Barking and biting Confronted with Aereo's unwarranted web re-broadcasting of over-the-air TV signals , the two significant sports organizations are n't the only teams who 've endangered to take their balls and go residence . Fox provided comparable dangers back in April , and various other broadcasters , consisting of CBS , have endangered radical measures , as well . On the other hand , Aereo continues increasing , and the solution is now readily available on Android and in cities throughout the United States ."	8
927	"If Love Were All ! It was night , and I was in the cell wherein the King had lain in the Castle of Zenda . The great pipe that Rupert of Hentzau had nicknamed "" Jacob's Ladder "" was gone , and the lights in the room across the moat twinkled in the darkness . All was still ; the din and clash of strife were gone . I had spent the day hidden in the forest , from the time when Fritz had led me off , leaving Sapt with the princess . Under cover of dusk , muffled up , I had been brought to the Castle and lodged where I now lay . Though three men had died there – two of them by my hand – I was not troubled by ghosts . I had thrown myself on a pallet by the window , and was looking out on the black water ; Johann , the keeper , still pale from his wound , but not much hurt besides , had brought me supper . He told me that the King was doing well , that he had seen the princess ; that she and he , Sapt and Fritz , had been long together . Marshal Strakencz was gone to Strelsau ; Black Michael lay in his coffin , and Antoinette de Mauban watched by him ; had I not heard , from the chapel , priests singing mass for him ? Outside there were strange rumours afloat . Some said that the prisoner of Zenda was dead ; some , that he had vanished yet alive ; some , that he was a friend who had served the King well in some adventure in England ; others , that he had discovered the Duke's plots , and had therefore been kidnapped by him . One or two shrewd fellows shook their heads and said only that they would say nothing , but they had suspicions that more was to be known than was known , if Colonel Sapt would tell all he knew . Thus Johann chattered till I sent him away and lay there alone , thinking , not of the future , but – as a man is wont to do when stirring things have happened to him – rehearsing the events of the past weeks , and wondering how strangely they had fallen out . And above me , in the stillness of the night , I heard the standards flapping against their poles , for Black Michael's banner hung there half-mast high , and above it the royal flag of Ruritania , floating for one night more over my head . Habit grows so quick , that only by an effort did I recollect that it floated no longer for me . Presently Fritz von Tarlenheim came into the room . I was standing then by the window ; the glass was opened , and I was idly fingering the cement which clung to the masonry where "" Jacob's Ladder "" had been . He told me briefly that the King wanted me , and together we crossed the drawbridge and entered the room that had been Black Michael's . The King was lying there in bed ; our doctor from Tarlenheim was in attendance on him , and whispered to me that my visit must be brief . The King held out his hand and shook mine . Fritz and the doctor withdrew to the window . I took the King's ring from my finger and placed it on his . "" I have tried not to dishonour it , sire , "" said I. "" I ca n't talk much to you , "" he said , in a weak voice . "" I have had a great fight with Sapt and the Marshal – for we have told the Marshal everything . I wanted to take you to Strelsau and keep you with me , and tell everyone of what you had done ; and you would have been my best and nearest friend , Cousin Rudolf . But they tell me I must not , and that the secret must be kept – if kept it can be . "" "" They are right , sire . Let me go . My work here is done . "" "" Yes , it is done , as no man but you could have done it . When they see me again , I shall have my beard on ; I shall – yes , faith , I shall be wasted with sickness . They will not wonder that the King looks changed in face . Cousin , I shall try to let them find him changed in nothing else . You have shown me how to play the King . "" "" Sire , "" said I. "" I can take no praise from you . It is by the narrowest grace of God that I was not a worse traitor than your brother . "" He turned inquiring eyes on me ; but a sick man shrinks from puzzles , and he had no strength to question me . His glance fell on Flavia's ring , which I wore . I thought he would question me about it ; but , after fingering it idly , he let his head fall on his pillow . "" I do n't know when I shall see you again , "" he said faintly , almost listlessly . "" If I can ever serve you again , sire , "" I answered . His eyelids closed . Fritz came with the doctor . I kissed the King's hand , and let Fritz lead me away . I have never seen the King since . Outside , Fritz turned , not to the right , back towards the drawbridge , but to the left , and without speaking led me upstairs , through a handsome corridor in the chateau . "" Where are we going ? "" I asked . Looking away from me , Fritz answered : "" She has sent for you . When it is over , come back to the bridge . I 'll wait for you there . "" "" What does she want ? "" said I , breathing quickly . He shook his head . "" Does she know everything ? "" "" Yes , everything . "" He opened a door , and gently pushing me in , closed it behind me . I found myself in a drawing-room , small and richly furnished . At first I thought that I was alone , for the light that came from a pair of shaded candles on the mantelpiece was very dim . But presently I discerned a woman's figure standing by the window . I knew it was the princess , and I walked up to her , fell on one knee , and carried the hand that hung by her side to my lips . She neither moved nor spoke . I rose to my feet , and , piercing the gloom with my eager eyes , saw her pale face and the gleam of her hair , and before I knew , I spoke softly : "" Flavia ! "" She trembled a little , and looked round . Then she darted to me , taking hold of me . "" Do n't stand , do n't stand ! No , you must n't ! You 're hurt ! Sit down – here , here ! "" She made me sit on a sofa , and put her hand on my forehead . "" How hot your head is , "" she said , sinking on her knees by me . Then she laid her head against me , and I heard her murmur : "" My darling , how hot your head is ! "" Somehow love gives even to a dull man the knowledge of his lover's heart . I had come to humble myself and pray pardon for my presumption ; but what I said now was : "" I love you with all my heart and soul ! "" For what troubled and shamed her ? Not her love for me , but the fear that I had counterfeited the lover as I had acted the King , and taken her kisses with a smothered smile . "" With all my life and heart , "" said I , as she clung to me . "" Always , from the first moment I saw you in the Cathedral ! There has been but one woman in the world to me – and there will be no other . But God forgive me the wrong I 've done you ! "" "" They made you do it ! "" she said quickly ; and she added , raising her head and looking in my eyes : "" It might have made no difference if I 'd known it . It was always you , never the King ! "" "" I meant to tell you , "" said I. "" I was going to on the night of the ball in Strelsau , when Sapt interrupted me . After that , I could n't – I could n't risk losing you before – before – I must ! My darling , for you I nearly left the King to die ! "" "" I know , I know ! What are we to do now , Rudolf ? "" I put my arm round her and held her up while I said : "" I am going away tonight . "" "" Ah , no , no ! "" she cried . "" Not tonight ! "" "" I must go tonight , before more people have seen me . And how would you have me stay , sweetheart , except – ? "" "" If I could come with you ! "" she whispered very low . "" My God ! "" said I roughly , "" do n't talk about that ! "" and I thrust her a little back from me . "" Why not ? I love you . You are as good a gentleman as the King ! "" Then I was false to all that I should have held by . For I caught her in my arms and prayed her , in words that I will not write , to come with me , daring all Ruritania to take her from me . And for a while she listened , with wondering , dazzled eyes . But as her eyes looked on me , I grew ashamed , and my voice died away in broken murmurs and stammerings , and at last I was silent . She drew herself away from me and stood against the wall , while I sat on the edge of the sofa , trembling in every limb , knowing what I had done – loathing it , obstinate not to undo it . So we rested a long time . "" I am mad ! "" I said sullenly . "" I love your madness , dear , "" she answered . Her face was away from me , but I caught the sparkle of a tear on her cheek . I clutched the sofa with my hand and held myself there . "" Is love the only thing ? "" she asked , in low , sweet tones that seemed to bring a calm even to my wrung heart . "" If love were the only thing , I would follow you – in rags , if need be – to the world's end ; for you hold my heart in the hollow of your hand ! But is love the only thing ? "" I made no answer . It gives me shame now to think that I would not help her . She came near me and laid her hand on my shoulder . I put my hand up and held hers . "" I know people write and talk as if it were . Perhaps , for some , Fate lets it be . Ah , if I were one of them ! But if love had been the only thing , you would have let the King die in his cell . "" I kissed her hand . "" Honour binds a woman too , Rudolf . My honour lies in being true to my country and my House . I do n't know why God has let me love you ; but I know that I must stay . "" Still I said nothing ; and she , pausing a while , then went on : "" Your ring will always be on my finger , your heart in my heart , the touch of your lips on mine . But you must go and I must stay . Perhaps I must do what it kills me to think of doing . "" I knew what she meant , and a shiver ran through me . But I could not utterly fail her . I rose and took her hand . "" Do what you will , or what you must , "" I said . "" I think God shows His purposes to such as you . My part is lighter ; for your ring shall be on my finger and your heart in mine , and no touch save of your lips will ever be on mine . So , may God comfort you , my darling ! "" There struck on our ears the sound of singing . The priests in the chapel were singing masses for the souls of those who lay dead . They seemed to chant a requiem over our buried joy , to pray forgiveness for our love that would not die . The soft , sweet , pitiful music rose and fell as we stood opposite one another , her hands in mine . "" My queen and my beauty ! "" said I. "" My lover and true knight ! "" she said . "" Perhaps we shall never see one another again . Kiss me , my dear , and go ! "" I kissed her as she bade me ; but at the last she clung to me , whispering nothing but my name , and that over and over again – and again – and again ; and then I left her . Rapidly I walked down to the bridge . Sapt and Fritz were waiting for me . Under their directions I changed my dress , and muffling my face , as I had done more than once before , I mounted with them at the door of the Castle , and we three rode through the night and on to the breaking day , and found ourselves at a little roadside station just over the border of Ruritania . The train was not quite due , and I walked with them in a meadow by a little brook while we waited for it . They promised to send me all news ; they overwhelmed me with kindness – even old Sapt was touched to gentleness , while Fritz was half unmanned . I listened in a kind of dream to all they said . "" Rudolf ! Rudolf ! Rudolf ! "" still rang in my ears – a burden of sorrow and of love . At last they saw that I could not heed them , and we walked up and down in silence , till Fritz touched me on the arm , and I saw , a mile or more away , the blue smoke of the train . Then I held out a hand to each of them . "" We are all but half-men this morning , "" said I , smiling . "" But we have been men , eh , Sapt and Fritz , old friends ? We have run a good course between us . "" "" We have defeated traitors and set the King firm on his throne , "" said Sapt . Then Fritz von Tarlenheim suddenly , before I could discern his purpose or stay him , uncovered his head and bent as he used to do , and kissed my hand ; and as I snatched it away , he said , trying to laugh : "" Heaven does n't always make the right men kings ! "" Old Sapt twisted his mouth as he wrung my hand . "" The devil has his share in most things , "" said he . The people at the station looked curiously at the tall man with the muffled face , but we took no notice of their glances . I stood with my two friends and waited till the train came up to us . Then we shook hands again , saying nothing ; and both this time – and , indeed , from old Sapt it seemed strange – bared their heads , and so stood still till the train bore me away from their sight . So that it was thought some great man travelled privately for his pleasure from the little station that morning ; whereas , in truth it was only I , Rudolf Rassendyll , an English gentleman , a cadet of a good house , but a man of no wealth nor position , nor of much rank . They would have been disappointed to know that . Yet had they known all they would have looked more curiously still . For , be I what I might now , I had been for three months a King , which , if not a thing to be proud of , is at least an experience to have undergone . Doubtless I should have thought more of it , had there not echoed through the air , from the towers of Zenda that we were leaving far away , into my ears and into my heart the cry of a woman's love – "" Rudolf ! Rudolf ! Rudolf ! "" Hark ! I hear it now !"	6

I should be grateful if you would arrange for this letter and its annex to be circulated as a document of the Security Council . ( Signed ) Jeremy Greenstock Chairman Counter-Terrorism Committee Annex [ Original : English ] Letter dated 27 December 2001 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations addressed to the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) concerning counter-terrorism On instructions from my Government , I have the honour of enclosing a report from the Sudan to the Counter-Terrorism Committee pursuant to paragraph 6 of Security Council resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) . My Government stands ready to provide the Committee with further reports or information , as necessary or if requested to do so by the Committee . I should be grateful if you would have the text of the present letter and the enclosed report circulated as a document of the Security Council . ( Signed ) Elfatih Erwa Permanent Representative Enclosure [ Original : Arabic ] Report of the Government of the Sudan submitted pursuant to paragraph 6 of Security Council resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) The Government of the Sudan , in its absolute belief that terrorism is one of the gravest crimes threatening the security of communities and societies , seeking to instil fear in peaceful persons , commit aggression against them and destroy property , and that it also threatens international relations and endangers the security of States ; itself having been the victim of terrorism directed against it during the past few years ; and convinced of the need to enlist every lawful means in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , international conventions and the resolutions and declarations of the United Nations General Assembly relating to terrorist acts that pose a threat to international peace and security and to strengthen international cooperation for that purpose , promptly and unequivocally condemned the terrorist acts committed in New York , Washington , D. C. , and Pennsylvania on 11 September 2001 , expressing its condolences to the Government and people of the United States of America and the families of the victims of every nationality . This included the following : A message from the President of the Republic addressed to the President of the United States of America on 11 September , expressing the Sudan's condemnation of the heinous crimes committed against innocent civilians in the United States of America as well as the destruction of property , transmitting the condolences of the Government and people of the Sudan to the Government and people of the United States and the families of the victims and affirming the desire to cooperate with the United States and the international community in combating every form of terrorism . The President of the Republic expressed the same sentiments in his statements made at Khartoum Airport on returning from a visit to Saudi Arabia on 12 September 2001 ; The statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 11 September , in which he described the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the American Department of Defense ( the Pentagon ) as criminal terrorist acts , expressing his heartfelt condolences and reaffirming the readiness of the Government of the Sudan to cooperate with the Government of the United States and the international community in combating all terrorist acts and bringing the perpetrators to justice ; On 12 September the Minister for Foreign Affairs also sent a message to American Secretary of State Colin Powell in which he condemned the terrorist acts and offered his condolences , reaffirming the willingness of the Sudan to cooperate fully with the United States ; On 12 September , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement along the same lines , emphasizing the Sudan's rejection of all forms of violence and expressing condolences to the families of the victims and the hope that the events would not lead to an escalation of violence ; Immediately after the events , the Government of the Sudan also stepped up security procedures in the country for the protection of the American diplomatic mission and American nationals in the country ; On 17 September 2001 , the Minister for Foreign Affairs presented condolences to the American Government on behalf of the Government of the Sudan and signed the register of condolences at the American embassy in Khartoum , stating to journalists that a year earlier the Sudan had received an American security team to engage in bilateral cooperation in the area of the fight against international terrorism and to make sure that the Sudan had no connection with international terrorism . Implementation of Security Council resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) Measures taken to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts In the area of legislation , the Sudan was one of the first countries to sign the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism , which it did on 29 February 2000 . The formalities are currently being completed for its ratification by the legislative authorities , whereupon it will become enforceable domestic law . Regarding the successive resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly on measures aimed at the elimination of international terrorism and the declarations issued by that body in 1994 and 1996 , especially in respect of the prevention and suppression of the financing of terrorism , the Sudan actively participated in the drafting of the related paragraphs . In particular , the Sudan proposed the addition of the following paragraph to General Assembly resolution 51 / 210 , of 1996 : "" [ Reiterates its ] call upon States to refrain from financing , encouraging , providing training for or otherwise supporting terrorist activities "" . Since that time , this paragraph has become a constant feature of General Assembly resolutions . The Sudan has been in the forefront in terms of awareness of the dangers of the financing of terrorist acts and the threat posed by those acts to the stability , security and peace of States . Its efforts in that area have been consistent and constant : when , for example , the Government of India proposed a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism , the Sudan welcomed and supported that initiative but insisted on the inclusion of an explicit article criminalizing the financing of terrorist acts by individuals , groups and States , as can be seen from the minutes of the working group involved in the drafting of the draft convention . The Sudan has also signed the international Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , which contains provisions on the drying-up of the resources of such crime and the organizations responsible for it with respect to money-laundering and other practices , and the legislative formalities for its ratification are currently being completed . The Sudan has acceded to the Arab Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism , article 3 of which provides for an undertaking by States not to finance terrorist acts and which is considered an enforceable internal law of the State . The Sudan has promulgated the Terrorism ( Combating ) Act , 2000 , chapter IV of which deals with general provisions on the seizure of property and equipment used in terrorist offences , including the confiscation of real estate and other property , equipment , arms , means of conveyance or other things proved to have been used in committing or attempting to commit , or in facilitating or assisting in the commission of , terrorist offences or in concealing those who plot , perpetrate , instigate or encourage such offences , etc. , in addition to any other penalty imposed by the competent court . It also deals with the seizure of terrorists' assets and of any property , real estate , equipment or funds owned by them and their deprivation of any benefit or utilization of any other resources , funds or property , whether in the Sudan or abroad ( Act annexed ) . The 1991 Banking Regulation Act granted the power to examine clients' accounts and transactions to the central bank and its governor and also , for judicial purposes , to the Minister of Justice or the judges . The law also granted the central bank the authority to inspect , supervise and monitor banks . The central bank has an officer trained in following sensitive banking operations and in ascertaining their domestic and foreign sources . It is also possible to determine their bank sources , if they involve bank financing or deposits , and the sources of such deposits . The Government of the Sudan therefore deems the existing legislation on banking activity adequate to enable the authorities to trace and prevent the financing of terrorist acts and to dry up any funds , provided that they are in banks operating in the Sudan . The problem , however , also involves dealing with practical dangers : in the context of the rapid transformation taking place in the country towards a free market economy and the encouragement of a flow of foreign investments into the country , Sudanese banks , like other banks throughout the world , are confronted with the rapid , easy transfer of deposits and assets in the Sudan via the banking map , both into and out of the country . This has gone hand in hand with an increase in financial flows and is expected to involve greater risks of money-laundering operations that face emerging markets in a number of developing countries . A further problem relates to the difficulty of tracing the primary sources of deposits and withdrawals if they are not bank-related . Such a situation requires the enhancement of technical capacities , the availability of up-to-date equipment , close control of communications and the flow of information to the central bank and other competent authorities so as to enable them to perform their tasks efficiently . This naturally necessitates international technical cooperation and the provision of the necessary support to achieve it and "" to intensifythe exchange of information on facts related to terrorism "" . The latter passage , whose inclusion was proposed by the Sudan in coordination with other States , is taken from General Assembly resolutions adopted since 1996 on measures aimed at eliminating international terrorism . Steps have also been taken since 1996 to dry up the sources of financing of suspected groups and individuals through the closing and liquidation of companies and related commercial activities , such as the Hijra Construction and Wadi Al - ' Aqiq companies , partly or wholly owned by Osama Bin Laden , and the Injaz company , suspected of being controlled by an Egyptian Islamic group . Offences and penalties relating to terrorist activities Sudanese law criminalizes terrorist acts . Indeed , chapter II of the Terrorism ( Combating ) Act , 2000 , contains provisions relating to terrorist offences , the direction of terrorism organizations and the criminalization of acts such as the hijacking of aircraft and means of sea , river or land conveyance ; the detention of or causing of injury to persons ; and environmental offences . Under this Act , the following are considered terrorist offences subject to the application of the Act even if perpetrated for political motives : murder ; theft accompanied by coercion against individuals , authorities or means of conveyance or communication ; acts of sabotage against public property or property earmarked for public use , even if owned in the Sudan by another State ; the crimes of manufacture , smuggling or possession of arms , munitions , explosives or other materials prepared for the commission of terrorist offences . The Act provides a number of penalties for terrorist offences , including the seizure and confiscation of money , property and equipment used in terrorist offences ; termination of residence and deportation , in the case of aliens ; punishments including imprisonment for a term of as much as 20 years or life , depending on the magnitude of the offence committed , a fine , or both ; and in some cases , execution ( see the annexed Terrorism ( Combating ) Act ) . The National Security Act of 1999 , as amended in 2001 , provides the death penalty or life imprisonment for any member who intentionally commits or refrains from an act for the purpose of imperilling the internal or exterior security of the country ( article 44 ) , and a penalty of imprisonment for a term no greater than 10 years or a fine or both for unlawfully having at one's disposal , or permitting another to have at his disposal , any weapons , munitions or matériel . The Penal Code of 1991 criminalizes terrorism and terrorist organizations , inasmuch as article 65 of the Code provides that anyone who establishes or directs an organization that plans to commit any crime or anyone who wilfully participates in or assists such an organization , whether operative in the Sudan or outside , shall be punished by imprisonment . If the crime planned by the organization is that of waging war or looting or is an offence punishable by death , or terrorism involving a threat to the public or the public authority , the penalty shall be imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years and may also be punished by a fine . In addition , article 144 of the Code provides as follows : ( i ) The perpetrator of the crime of terrorism is one who : Addresses to any person a threat to harm him or to harm any other person important to him for the purpose of intimidating him or inducing him to do what he need not do according to law or not to do what he is permitted to do by law ; b . Makes a movement or exhibits readiness to act , intending thereby to use unlawful force or knowing that he is thus likely to make any person present believe that he is about to use such force against him ; ( ii ) The crime of terrorism shall be punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine or both . C. Legislation and procedures in force for freezing accounts and assets at banks The 1991 Banking Regulation Act , as amended , grants the central bank , the Minister of Justice ( Attorney General ) and the judiciary the authority to examine accounts and article 10 grants the Bank of Sudan ( the central bank ) the right of inspection , of issuing orders for the purposes of inspection and of control . The Act also grants the Bank the power to freeze moneys and financial assets deposited with banks and to dry up their sources , provided that the matter relates to Sudanese banks . The Terrorism ( Combating ) Act , moreover , requires the competent court to confiscate all real estate and other property , equipment , arms , means of conveyance or other things proved to have been used in committing or attempting to commit , or in facilitating or assisting in the commission of , terrorist offences or in harbouring those who plot , perpetrate , instigate or encourage such offences or have been charged with so doing , whether by word , deed , publication , failure to act or consent to the perpetration thereof , with the knowledge of the owner of the property , whether he made use thereof personally or through any of his subordinates or persons working with him . The court also has the right to order the seizure of any real or other property , assets , equipment or funds owned by a suspect whose involvement in a terrorist act has been substantiated and to deprive him of any benefit or the utilization of any other resources , funds or property , whether in the Sudan or abroad ( article 18 of the Act ) ; As examples of steps taken , the central bank undertook an investigation of charges that Osama Bin Laden was a shareholder in Al-Shamal Islamic Bank , though nothing was found to substantiate those accusations ( see annex V ) . Moreover , the accounts of all companies and commercial firms suspected of involvement in one way or another in terrorist organizations and those of suspected individuals were frozen , and a review was conducted of all the registers of shareholders in Sudanese banks so as to ensure that there were no shares or financial or commercial activity of any suspected individuals or organizations . Measures taken to prevent terrorist activities The Government has taken a number of measures for the prevention of terrorist activities in the country , such as the adoption , in August 1995 , of a decision requiring any alien coming to the country to obtain an entry visa in advance , so as to make it possible to ascertain the identity of visitors and protect the country against the entry of any terrorist elements . The decision provided exceptions for certain nationalities under bilateral agreements . However , the Government followed that decision with a subsequent one in 1998 , requiring nationals of all countries to obtain entry visas to the Sudan , including nationals of those countries for which obtaining entry visas had not previously been required . In addition , amendments to the Passport and Migration Act of 1993 included the following : The Minister of the Interior has the right to deport any foreign person from the Sudan , the Minister's decision being final and not subject to appeal before the courts of law ; b . Under article 32 of the same law , the legislator provides penalties for illegal entry into the Sudan and for facilitating such entry or providing accommodation or shelter to persons who have thus entered ; c . Under article 33 , authority is granted to the police to arrest persons who enter the Sudan without permission and to keep them under detention until they have been brought to trial . In the wake of the events of 11 September 2001 , the Ministry of the Interior issued standing order No. 33 of 2001 calling for new controls and procedures for the entry of aliens and immigration security procedures at land and sea entry points , including airports and seaports . These procedures were aimed primarily at barring the entry into the country of any person suspected of having any connection with terrorist acts and preventing such persons from obtaining entry visas . The decision was also aimed at control of the entry or exit of any persons reportedly having a connection with the events of 11 September 2001 , with a view to their apprehension in the event that they are found . Controls were also tightened in connection with aliens staying in hotels , inns and private homes , the registration of whom is required by law ; moreover , employment agents for domestic help are required to report any foreign residents to the Aliens Section of the Ministry of the Interior . Security measures have also been taken to prevent foreign diplomats and their families and foreign interests and investments from being exposed to any hostile acts . The Government has earnestly complied with requests directed to it by foreign Governments , including the Government of the United States of America , to provide them with any information it might have on suspected persons . The competent departments of the central bank have confirmed that the Sudanese banking system does not maintain any accounts or balances belonging to any entities placed on the terrorist lists , and this also applies to commercial banks , based on their responses to the central bank . The Bank of Sudan ( central bank ) declares its full readiness to collaborate and cooperate in the investigation of any account or balance , provided that it is furnished with the name of the holder , by virtue of the authority to undertake such tasks granted to the Bank by law . The measures taken by the authorities include , in particular , the following : A review of all records of aliens present in the country to ensure that they do not belong to any terrorist organizations or take part in any questionable activities , the examination being repeated periodically ; The creation of specialized counter-terrorist units and their preparation and training ; Enhancement and retraining of monitoring and control means and instruments at the country's ports and other points of entry . Legislation in force in the country to prevent terrorist activities Enlistment for the purpose of carrying out terrorist acts : Terrorism ( Combating ) Act , 2000 ( articles 6-12 , 19 ) ; The Penal Code of 1991 ( article 65 ) . Supplying of arms to terrorists : Terrorism ( Combating ) Act , 2000 ; The National Security Act of 1999 , as amended in 2001 ; The 1986 Arms , Ammunition and Explosives Act ; The 1986 Customs Act ; The 1994 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act . Measures against the above : ( i ) The State has undertaken and is carrying out campaigns to collect private weapons in the Western Sudan and has concluded agreements and memoranda of understanding with a number of neighbouring States in line with its objective of controlling exit / entry points with a view to preventing arms from being surreptitiously brought into the country via illegal channels . It has also issued a regulation on the possession of arms which permits such possession solely by permit and abolishes the right of ownership of more than one firearm per person . It should be pointed out that the Arms , Ammunition and Explosives Act prohibits the entry of arms , ammunition and explosives into the country without permission ; moreover , the entry into the Sudan of some weapons , such as missiles , portable detonators , etc. , is prohibited , and the Minister of the Interior has the power to add items . The act also regulates the registration of arms and prohibits trafficking in them or their manufacture outside of the State facilities . It defines how they are to be exported and imported and how arms in transit are to be dealt with , in addition to regulating explosives , their storage and their use and determining the penalties for violations of the Act ; ( ii ) Terrorist events , which have been on the increase throughout the world and which reached their acme in the United States of America on 11 September 2001 , have forced the Sudan to place on its list of priorities the question of bilateral cooperation with neighbouring countries with a view to the elimination of terrorism and the adoption of safety procedures for preventing the perpetration or planning of such events . An example of this is the counter-terrorist cooperation agreement signed between the Sudanese state of Kassala and the Gash-Barka zone of Eritrea in November 2001 ; ( iii ) In September 2001 the Intergovernmental Authority on Development ( IGAD ) , which includes Djibouti , Eritrea , Ethiopia , Kenya , Somalia , the Sudan and Uganda , met in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa and drafted a protocol on the establishment of a conflict early warning and response mechanism with a view to conflict prevention and resolution . The aim of the protocol is to establish , and to eliminate all kinds of threats to , peace , security and stability in the States members of the group . It is expected that the protocol will be adopted by the IGAD summit planned for January 2002 . Steps taken to prevent terrorist acts and early warning mechanisms to allow exchange of relevant information with other States The State is committed to exchanging information with other States within the framework of the international and regional instruments to which it is a party , treaties on judicial assistance , treaties on the extradition of criminals and United Nations resolutions , in addition to numerous conventions and memoranda of understanding concluded by the Sudan with neighbouring States for that purpose . Mention might be made , for example , of the cooperation in the field of security that has taken place over the past two years with the United States of America as well as with other States ; The customs authorities are stepping up the control and inspection of goods entering the Sudan , having packages and mail checked by the customs laboratory and performing chemical and biological testing whenever doubt exists . The passport and immigration authorities and the Ministry of the Interior are now also taking a number of measures , including the designing of new passports and identity documents that are difficult to falsify ; the preparation of a civil registry of all persons resident in the country , including both nationals and aliens ; the promulgation of a related law ; the bolstering of cooperation between the Interpol office in Khartoum and its other offices throughout the world ; and the strengthening of controls relating to aliens staying in inns and hotels . Within the Ministry of the Interior there is a committee on aliens , made up of representatives of the various organs of the State , which looks into the status of aliens and questions relating to their residence and visas . C. Procedures and legislation to prevent the Sudan from being a safe haven for terrorists National legislation and international and regional instruments ratified or acceded to by the Sudan prevent the country from being a safe haven for terrorists . Specific mention of this question is found in the following national acts : The Terrorism ( Combating ) Act , which provides for its compulsory application to anyone who undertakes , instigates , attempts or facilitatesthe commission of a terrorist offence and provides penalties therefor , including the seizure of property and the death penalty . It also permits the expulsion and deportation of persons who commit such offences and their extradition to injured States . In addition , the Customs Act , the Sudanese Regulation of Asylum Act ( Asylum ( Control ) Act ) , the Arms , Ammunition and Explosives Act and the treaties on the extradition of criminals signed with certain States all regulate the movement of aliens within the country and the punishment of aliens who break the law , particularly with respect to terrorist offences . The harsh penalties imposed for terrorist offences constitute a suitable deterrent . The Passport and Migration Act of 1993 grants the Minister of the Interior the power to expel from the country any undesirable alien ; The measures taken have included the reinstatement of the requirement to obtain visas in order to enter the country , residence procedures , checking at exit / entry points and permission to acquire arms and ammunition only in accordance with the law and subject to strict controls ; The Sudan has in fact cooperated with a number of injured States in the extradition of persons suspected of having committed terrorist offences . It complied with a request by the Government of Ethiopia for the return of Ethiopians suspected of having committed the terrorist offence of hijacking an Ethiopian aircraft and forcing it to fly to Khartoum in 1995 , and in 1997 it turned over to the French Government the person known as "" Carlos "" , who was suspected of having committed terrorist offences , despite the absence of any convention on the mutual extradition of criminals between the two States . In 2001 the Sudan arrested Ethiopian terrorists who had hijacked an Ethiopian aircraft and diverted it to the Sudan : they were indicted and ordered to stand trial in the Sudan . The Sudan also tried the person named Al-Khalifi , an alien who committed a terrorist offence that involved the killing of a number persons praying in a Khartoum mosque . He was condemned to death and the sentence was executed ; International conventions on the elimination of international terrorism , all of which have been acceded to or ratified by the Sudan , contain exceptions for offences having a political character . However , the bilateral conventions on the extradition of criminals concluded by the Sudan with other States , such as the 1964 Treaty on the Extradition of Criminals concluded with Ethiopia , make those offences non-political , which means that the exception regarding them is abrogated . Consequently , the bilateral and regional legal instruments to which the Sudan is a party have strengthened the Sudan's international commitment under the international conventions on the extradition , prosecution , and trial of terrorists . Legislation or procedures to prevent terrorists from acting from within the Sudan against other States The Sudan is a pioneer State in the fight against terrorism through legislation , having acceded to 11 of the 12 international conventions against international terrorism ( see annexed list ) . It is now in the process of completing the formalities for accession to the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism , which has been signed , and for accession to other regional instruments ( the African Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism and the Convention of the Organization of the Islamic Conference on Combating International Terrorism ) . Under the Sudanese judicial system , the conventions acceded to have become enforceable as part of the country's domestic law . Moreover , national acts , such as the Terrorism ( Combating ) Act , the National Security Act , the Penal Code , the Arms , Ammunition and Explosives Act , the Customs Act , the Regulation of Asylum Act , the Extradition Act and bilateral agreements on the extradition of criminals , prohibit and provide penalties for the organization , financing or commission of terrorist acts or participation in such acts in any manner whatsoever . The Terrorism ( Combating ) Act , moreover , specifically and categorically prohibits engaging in terrorism within Sudanese territory or directing , instigating , attempting , participating in or facilitating , by word , deed or publication , in any manner whatsoever , the direction of an organized network used for committing any terrorist offence or offences in such a way that its operation poses a threat to persons , property or the public tranquillity , irrespective of whether such network operates within or outside the Sudan . The law provides severe punishment for such terrorist offences , which may involve death by crucifixion , simple death , cross amputation ( amputation of the right hand and left foot ) , life imprisonment or ordinary imprisonment , for they are considered grave offences . The Sudan does in fact engage in cooperation with a number of States in the common fight against terrorism , including the exchange of information and even the taking of steps for the extradition of suspected terrorists ( such as the extradition of Carlos to France and the expulsion of Osama Bin Laden from the country ) , as well as the adoption of stricter procedures for the entry of aliens and their residence in the country . In addition , periodic reviews are performed to ensure that the country is rid of any activity or presence of any of the organizations of known involvement in international terrorism that are listed by the Security Council . The Terrorism ( Combating ) Act also provides that it is applicable to any person suspected of committing , attempting to commit or inciting a terrorist offence either within or outside the Sudan . It also applies to any person who commits , attempts to commit or abets the commission of a terrorist offenceagainst any alien in the Sudan or legally resident there and to any person suspected of committing , attempting to commit or inciting a terrorist offence , provided that the terrorist act is punishable under both Sudanese law and the law of the State in which it was committed and that State agrees to the application of the Terrorism ( Combating ) Act in the Sudan . The Act further makes it compulsory to deport any alien convicted of committing , attempting to commit , inciting or providing financing or technical assistance for a terrorist offence , who must be expelled from the country or extradited in accordance with the law to any country injured by the terrorist offence . It also gives the authorities the power to expel any alien concerning whom there is evidence that he entered the country for the purpose of committing a terrorist offence , within a period not exceeding two weeks . Article 51 , paragraph c , of the Sudanese Penal Code provides that anyone who , in the Sudan , without the permission of the State , raises an army and equips it to attack a foreign State or carries out against a foreign State an act of aggression that is likely to expose the country to the risk of war is to be considered as having committed the offence of causing war against the State and may be punished by death , life imprisonment or a fixed term of imprisonment and possible confiscation of all his property . Also , the resolutions of the Security Council and the lists produced by its committees are always transmitted to the competent authorities for implementation , including its resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) concerning Afghanistan . Cooperation also takes place , through the Interpol office , with the corresponding offices in other States . E. Steps taken to establish terrorist acts as serious criminal offences and to ensure that the punishment reflects the seriousness of the offence The Sudan deals with terrorist offences in earnest , considering them grave offences . For this reason it has acceded to international and regional instruments . It has in fact taken part in their drafting and is at present participating earnestly in the development of a comprehensive treaty against terrorism in the United Nations . As a culmination of that interest , and especially in view of the fact that during the latter half of the 1990s the country suffered considerably from a series of terrorist offences in most of which a foreign hand was visible , the Terrorism ( Combating ) Act , 2000 , was promulgated , considering terrorist offences as grave offences affecting the interests and the social and national security of the Sudan . The Act defined terrorism as meaning any act of violence or threat of violence , irrespective of its motive or objectives , carried out in execution of an individual or collective criminal scheme and aimed at instilling terror in people or the fear that they will be harmed ; jeopardizing their lives , freedom or security ; causing harm to the environment ; harming , occupying or seizing any public or private property or facility ; or endangering any national or strategic resource . The penalties are graduated under national law according to the seriousness and consequences of the act . The Penal Code , for example , makes the creation or direction of terrorist criminal organizations , whether operating in the Sudan or outside , punishable by imprisonment for up to five years or a fine or both . If , however , the offence plotted by the organization is a grave offence , such as war or looting , a crime punishable by death , or terrorism involving a threat to the general public or the public authority , the penalty of imprisonment becomes compulsory , though it must not exceed ten years , and the imposition of a fine is also permissible . This , of course , applies to plotting , but if the offence has been committed , the punishment , depending on penalty provided by law , may be as severe as death . The law also provides that a person who commits the offence of terrorism , which here means threatening harm in order to cause a person to do what he is not required to do by law or making a movement or exhibiting readiness to act , intending thereby to use unlawful force , shall be punished by imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine or both . It should be mentioned that steps are currently being taken by the Ministry of Justice to review those penalties in order to make them more severe in the Penal Code . Under the Terrorism ( Combating ) Act , a terrorist offence against the State , the security of its society , citizens or property is punishable by death or life imprisonment . The same applies to anyone who plots , instigates , attempts , facilitates or participates in the direction of an organized network planning to commit terrorist offences , whether the network operates in the Sudan or abroad . The penalty for the seizure of aircraft may be as high as 14 years or a fine or both , and if the act results in damage to or endangers the safety of the aircraft and those aboard it , the penalty may be life imprisonment or death . The Act also provides that any act causing physical damage to the environment or jeopardizing the lives of persons shall be deemed a terrorist act and shall be punishable , upon a verdict of guilty , by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 20 years and a fine . The following are some of the punishments that have actually been carried out : The case of Mohamed Abdul Rahman Al-Khalifi , a Libyan national who attacked persons praying in a mosque in the city of Omdurman on 24 February 1994 , killing 19 of them and wounding more than 20 . He was sentenced to death and the sentence was executed ; The Kambo Ashara incident in Wad Madani ( 1 January 1997 ) , in which members of the group known as "" Al-Takfir wal-Hijra "" attacked the inhabitants of Kambo Ashara with firearms . The security authorities opposed them , killing eight of the assailants , and the rest were brought to trial and sentenced to imprisonment for various terms ; The Jarafa incident , in which the Sudanese national known as Abbas Al-Sharif Al-Baqir , a member of the extremist group known as "" Al-Takfir wal-Hijra "" , attacked persons praying in the Jarafa Mosque on 8 December 2000 . The attack resulted in the death of 24 persons at prayer . He was countered by the police and killed in an exchange of fire with them . Trial of aliens : the past two years witnessed a number of trials of aliens who had entered the country illegally or violated national laws . The related sentences included expulsion from the country . Procedures and mechanisms in place to assist other States ( with examples ) The policy of the Government of the Sudan has been characterized by cooperation with other States in the field of counter-terrorism . This became apparent in Security Council resolution 1372 ( 2001 ) of 28 September 2001 , concerning the Sudan , which acknowledged the steps taken by the Government of the Sudan to comply with the provisions of Security Council resolutions 1044 ( 1996 ) , 1054 ( 1996 ) and 1070 ( 1996 ) and decided the immediate termination of the measures referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Council's resolution 1054 ( 1996 ) and paragraph 3 of its resolution 1070 ( 1996 ) , relating to the Sudan . The Sudan's policy regarding cooperation with other countries is also manifest in its accession to regional and bilateral legal cooperation treaties . Indeed , it is one of the States parties to the Riyadh Arab Convention on Technical , Legal and Judicial Cooperation and has concluded a Treaty on Judicial and Legal Cooperation and Extradition of Criminals with the Syrian Arab Republic and individual treaties on the extradition of criminals with Kenya , Uganda , Ethiopia and the Central African Republic . The Sudan is a party to the Arab Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism , which provides for cooperation in that area among the Arab States , and has concluded with neighbouring countries cooperation agreements that contain provisions on cooperation in the field of counter-terrorism . That cooperation is also provided for in the national legislation referred to above . As can be seen from the foregoing paragraphs , the Government of the Sudan has adopted measures to assist other States in the field of counter-terrorism , in connection , for example , with the extradition of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist offences to both Ethiopia and France , in addition to cooperating with many States in the exchange of information among competent bodies . Border controls and checking of identity papers As mentioned , the measures adopted include the imposing of conditions on the obtainment of an entry visa to the Sudan , pursuant to Ministry of the Interior decision 185 of 1998 , and tight control of entry and exit at the country's entry / exit points . In addition , in the wake of the events of 11 September 2001 , the Ministry of the Interior issued standing order No. 33 of 2001 , which called for new controls and procedures for the entry of aliens and migration security procedures at airports , seaports and land exit / entry points . The basic purpose of those measures is to prohibit the entry of any person suspected of having connections with terrorist activities . The decision was also aimed at monitoring and at making sure that no persons listed as connected with the events of 11 September 2001 enter or leave , so that they might be apprehended if found . It must be pointed out that the Sudan shares long borders with nine countries and a seacoast extending along the Red Sea ; consequently , the task of fully controlling those borders is beset with practical difficulties and requires international technical cooperation and close cooperation between neighbouring States . With regard to identity papers , procedures are actually under way for the production of difficult-to-counterfeit documents . Steps taken to intensify and accelerate the exchange of information on movements of terrorist persons or networks , forged or falsified travel documents , traffic in arms or sensitive materials , the use of communications technologies and the possession of weapons of mass destruction The Government of the Sudan cooperates with a number of States in the area of information exchange and is developing national information networks to facilitate the flow of information and consequently the exchange of information with other States ; Steps taken in respect of cooperation on administrative and judicial matters The Government of the Sudan cooperates with other States under agreements on judicial and legal cooperation and within the framework of the Sudanese Extradition Act and the relevant bilateral agreements . There are many examples , as shown in the course of this report , and close cooperation in this area exists with a number of States , within the framework of which information is exchanged among competent bodies ; C. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation for the prevention of terrorist acts and expulsion procedures actually carried out The Government of the Sudan cooperates in that area and has announced at the highest levels ( that of the President of the Republic ) its strong desire for international cooperation in the area of counter-terrorism . Cooperation exists with many countries , such as the United States of America , European and Asian countries and neighbouring States . Moreover , the Government of the Sudan has expelled persons or extradited them to other States , as in the case of the expulsion , in 1996 , of Osama Bin Laden , who had entered the Sudan as an investor in the early 1990s , and a group of his collaborators ; the case of the extradition to France , in 1997 , of the person known as "" Carlos "" , who had entered the Sudan with a forged identity document ; and the case of the extradition of an Ethiopian group that had hijacked an Ethiopian aircraft in 1995 . In addition , the Sudan expelled some 400 aliens resident in the Sudan following the attempted assassination of the Egyptian President in Addis Ababa in 1995 . Signing of and accession to regional and international conventions The Sudan is one of the more advanced States with regard to the signing of or accession to the relevant international and regional instruments . It has become a party to 11 international conventions and is in the process of completing the formalities for the ratification of the twelfth , namely the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism , which has been signed by the Sudan . It is also completing the formalities for accession to the African Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism and the Convention of the Organization of the Islamic Conference on Combating International Terrorism . Upon completing those formalities , the Sudan will be a party to all the international and regional instruments on combating international terrorism . The fact that the Sudan has become a party to all international conventions and protocols aimed at the elimination of international terrorism , concerning which the Secretary-General of the United Nations produces a yearly report that is examined by the Sixth Committee of the United Nations General Assembly , prompted the Assembly to include a paragraph in its report on measures to eliminate international terrorism , adopted in 2000 at its Millennium Assembly , the text of which we would like to cite here : Notes with appreciation and satisfaction that , during the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly and the Millennium Assembly , a number of States became parties to the relevant conventions and protocols thereby realizing the objective of wider acceptance and implementation of those conventions ; The Sudan is thus in the forefront of the States Members of the United Nations that have complied with the appeals contained in the resolutions and declarations issued by the United Nations General Assembly and in Security Council resolution 1269 ( 1999 ) , which call upon and encourage States to become parties to all the international conventions on combating terrorism and to implement and apply them . E. Any relevant information on the implementation of conventions and protocols Upon the Sudan 's becoming a party to the international and regional instruments , those instruments became part of its domestic law applied by judicial organs . The instruments were forwarded to the official gazette for publication and communicated to the country's judiciary in order to be implemented . Legislation , procedures and mechanisms in place for ensuring that asylum seekers have not been involved in terrorist activity before being granted refugee status , with examples The Sudan is a party to the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and the related 1967 Protocol and is bound by their provisions . The 1974 Regulation of Asylum Act governs all matters relating to refugees : it makes it incumbent on the competent authority in the country to observe any convention or treaty governing such status to which the Sudan is a party and stipulates that , in the application of the Act , priority is to be accorded to such conventions or treaties ( see annex VII ) . Under the Act , refugees are subject to the general laws of the country . They are not permitted to engage in any political activity during their stay in the Sudan or to leave the place of residence assigned to them except subject to specific rules . Mention should be made of the Sudan's reservation regarding article 26 of the 1951 Convention , which is intended to enable it to abide by its obligation under article 3 of the 1969 Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa , which provides that refugees must abstain from hostile activities against OAU member States . A refugee may also be deported for having committed a serious non-political crime outside the Sudan before being granted permission to enter as a refugee ( such as a terrorist offence , inasmuch as such offences are not considered political offences under Sudanese law , even if committed for political reasons ) . In such a case he may be extradited in accordance with the Sudanese Extradition Act of 1957 ( article 11 ( b )) . He may also be deported if he commits an act contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations or the Organization of African Unity ( article 11 ( d )) ; if he commits a serious non-political crime outside the Sudan after being granted asylum ( article 11 ( e )) ; or if his presence in the Sudan constitutes a danger to internal or external security ( article 11 ( f )) . The procedures followed include the examination of applicants for refugee status at points of entry by the office of the commissioner for refugees and the ascertainment that they meet the conditions for that status in accordance with the Convention on the Status of Refugees and the relevant international law and domestic law . Procedures in place to prevent the abuse of refugee status by terrorists The law prohibits refugees from engaging in political activities and from plotting , directing , undertaking or participating in terrorist acts against a foreign State . Refugees are restricted and required for the most part to remain in a single place such as a refugee camp , and their movements are controlled and monitored to ensure their compliance with the law . Moreover , the Terrorism ( Combating ) Act and the Regulation of Asylum Act prohibit the invocation of political motives to prevent the extradition of suspected terrorists , inasmuch as the Act does not take political motives into account in terrorist offences . H. Additional information or observations on the implementation of the resolution As we have mentioned , the Sudan has continued to be a State that is eager to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism in all its forms , a position that has been concretely reflected in its accession to international and regional instruments , not to mention its share in the drafting of those instruments through its participation in the forums that prepared them . It has also been reflected in the cooperation the Sudan has evinced for many years with injured States . Furthermore , the item "" international terrorism "" , which was one of the items of the Sudanese-European dialogue during its first year ( 1999 ) , was dropped in the second year of the dialogue as a result of satisfaction with the Sudan's earnest compliance and its pioneering State policies on combating terrorism . The Government reaffirmed its anti-terrorist policies in a statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs before the National Council ( Parliament ) on 25 April 2001 ( annexed hereto ) , in which he reaffirmed the Sudan's absolute condemnation of all forms of terrorism and its constructive cooperation with the international community in countering it . He emphasized that such cooperation included the extradition of suspects , judicial cooperation and the exchange of information and that the Government of the Sudan would not provide any safe haven or permit any training or financing of or support for any individuals or groups involved in terrorist activities . It was those convictions that prompted the Sudan's attitude of cooperation with the international community and condemnation of the recent terrorist events . The Sudan took the initiative to invite the African Dispute Settlement Mechanism to a meeting in New York during the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly in order to discuss African cooperation in the field of terrorism , which resulted in the issuance of a statement by the Mechanism on that subject that was considered an official document of the General Assembly . The Sudan also calls for collective Arab efforts against terrorism in all its forms as well as efforts on the part of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and other regional organizations in which it participates , such as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development ( IGAD ) and the Sahelo-Saharan group . The Government of the Sudan is determined to conduct a general review of the relevant legislation with a view to revising it and to coping with the rapid changes taking place in the nature of international terrorism . The Sudan feels that the adoption by the international community of a comprehensive definition of terrorism will facilitate the identification of terrorist activity and provide a legal tool for its elimination . Areas in which the country requires technical assistance The Sudan needs material and technical assistance in order to develop its capacities for the fight against terrorism and for international cooperation and information exchange . Such help is needed in the following areas : Completion of the building of national and specialized information networks ; Support for the implementation of the civil registration project being carried out by the Ministry of the Interior ; Support in connection with the review of national legislation and the dissemination of international and regional instruments on the fight against terrorism ; Assistance in developing chemical and biological materials and weapons search technologies ; Development and strengthening of border control and early warning systems ; Strengthening and development of customs workshops and laboratories from the technical standpoint ; Training in the various areas of the fight against terrorism ; Support for the counter-terrorism unit of the Ministry of the Interior ( in the process of being established ) ; Strengthening and development of the technology of the central bank and the financial information network ; Support for the office for national liaison with the Counter-Terrorism Committee established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) .

38	"Apple and the Environment Frequently Asked Questions Q : How does Apple review the company's progress and status regarding its environmental impact ? A : Apple's Executive Team is responsible for setting and implementing environmental policies . This group of the company's most senior executives is advised by teams from across Apple , including environmental engineering , product development , operations , facilities , and supplier responsibility . Apple's climate change strategy is built into all facilities development plans and plays an important role in the product development process . In 2009 , at the direction of the Executive Team , Apple became the first company in the electronics industry to report its entire carbon footprint including the impact of its products on the environment through consumer use . In addition to providing consumers with an unprecedented level of detail and transparency on which to base their purchasing decisions , measuring the company's carbon footprint helps the company identify areas where it can make the most significant reductions . We understand that the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions ( up to 98 percent ) come from the product life cycle , which is why decisions about the environmental attributes of our products are an integral aspect of all decisions related to the design and manufacture of those products . The same is true of all the environmental decisions for our facilities . Our integrated approach means that decisions about environmental issues are reviewed at the highest levels of the company . This structure has been an important factor in Apple's success , particularly in the area of environmental responsibility . Executive Team members regularly review each new product during its development , focusing on material and design choices , the supply chain , packaging , and product energy efficiency . Each of these areas has a direct impact on our environmental footprint . This strategy , which we 've been using for well over two decades , has yielded the most environmentally forward-looking product designs in our industry . Every product we offer meets the ENERGY STAR guidelines for energy efficiency , is free of harmful toxins , and is made of highly recyclable materials . Our facilities and operations teams also regularly review our programs and investments to reduce carbon emissions with Executive Team members . The results of these reviews include increased use of green power , new technology investments , commute programs , and conservation . The efforts of this team have produced the highest product recycling rate in our industry . Apple delivers important environmental attributes across all the company's products and product families . Not only does Apple deliver where others have only promised to do so in the future , Apple has delivered where it 's most meaningful . The Apple Executive Team is committed to our environmental strategy : to reduce our carbon footprint , to remove toxins , and to report on the environmental impact of every product we make so that our customers can measure our progress . We are also committed to reporting our global corporate emissions annually and to reporting at the product level with each new product introduction . Q : What is Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) ? A : LCA is a process of evaluating the effects that a product has on the environment throughout its life cycle . The objective of completing a full life cycle analysis is to improve resource efficiency while reducing the environmental impact of all activities required to manufacture , distribute , use , and dispose of a product . Cradle-to-grave life cycle assessments , for instance , begin with the extraction of raw materials from the earth , their transformation into finished materials , the manufacturing of materials into parts and products , transportation to end users , the energy consumed during use , and ultimately recycling . During each of these phases , activities occur that use materials and energy , generating waste and emissions . Life cycle assessment is the process used to accurately measure the emissions associated with each phase of these activities . LCA results are often categorized in several ways , including global warming potential , acidification , eutrophication , tropospheric ozone creation , and stratospheric ozone depletion . The procedures followed for life cycle assessment are defined as part of the internationally recognized ISO 14000 environmental management standards : in ISO 14040 : 2006 and 14044 : 2006 . Successful implementations of LCAs have been achieved in many industries , including automobile , airline , and consumer goods companies . For complex products and processes composed of several thousand materials , the analysis requires dedicated software applications designed to accurately capture the environmental impact of very specific processes . Software tools provide an efficient and objective assessment of the environmental impacts a company measures by using third-party databases created and updated by independent industrial engineers who are experts in specific manufacturing processes . Apple has found that a combination of data collected directly from our internal and supplier processes as well as independent third-party data sets achieves the most accurate results . Q : How does Apple use LCA ? A : Apple uses five steps when conducting a product LCA : 1 . Data collection starts with measuring the power consumed by a product while it is running under a simulated use scenario . Different scenarios are used for different product lines . For example , we assume a four-year average use period for Mac computers . To be conservative , we also assume an office scenario use pattern for every computer shipped and apply that use pattern to 365 days of use per year . For handheld products , such as iPod and iPhone , we assume a three-year use period . For these products , charging patterns are defined according to a "" power user , "" which we define as intense daily use over the three-year period . More information on our product power modes is provided in our Product Environmental Reports . 2 . The second step is a part-by-part measurement of the entire product . This helps us accurately measure the size and weight of the components and materials in the product . Since a single product can contain several hundred parts , this step is supported by double-checking individual part details with the product's bill of materials . We include material and component yield loss during production as part of this process . We also account for the transportation of materials between manufacturing sites . Production emissions for external accessories , such as keyboards and mice , and packaging are also included in this step . 3 . The third step assesses emissions from transportation of finished products to sales regions . Data is collected on single units and multipack units of product shipments as they are transported over land , by sea , and by air . The majority of the product transportation emissions are associated with getting the products from Asia to sales distribution hubs in Europe , Asia , and the Americas . The final leg of transport between regional hubs and individual customers is accounted for using an overall adjustment factor . 4 . The last step of the product life cycle measurement is the collection and recycling of the product when it reaches the end of its useful life . Transportation between customers and recycling plants along with the treatment steps carried out by the recycler to obtain metal , plastic , and glass material streams are all accounted for in this calculation . Subsequent processing and smelting steps are not included as these are considered stages of production and not end-of-life processing . 5 . After we collect all the data , the final step is to run the product data model in our LCA tool and compile detailed results for GHG emissions as they relate to the product . The data and life cycle model used in the tool are checked for quality and accuracy by the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany . Q : Does Apple index its environmental performance data using Global Reporting Initiative ( GRI ) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines ( G3 ) ? A : Yes . Environmental performance data covering energy and water consumption , greenhouse gas emissions , and waste production is provided in the 2009 Facilities Report ( PDF ) . Q : What is ISO 14001 , and is Apple ISO 14001 certified ? A : ISO 14001 is a voluntary international standard that establishes the requirements for an organization's environmental management system ( EMS ) . The ISO 14001 standard helps a company manage the environmental impact of its operations in a systematic way that is integrated with overall business management processes . Apple first achieved ISO 14001 certification for a manufacturing site in 1996 . Q : Does Apple ban environmentally sensitive substances ? A : Yes . Apple's Regulated Substances Specification details a broad range of substances that are restricted or banned from use in Apple products , packaging , and manufacturing . Q : Do Apple products contain lead ? A : Apple is in compliance with the European RoHS Directive , which restricts the use of lead and other substances . As a result of our precautionary approach to substances , Apple phased out lead in plastic parts , paint , and packaging material long before the RoHS Directive came into effect . Q : What are Apple's restrictions on brominated flame retardant-free ( BFR-free ) and polyvinyl chloride-free ( PVC-free ) products ? A : Apple defines a material as BFR-free and PVC-free if it contains less than 900 parts per million ( ppm ) of bromine and chlorine . The 900-ppm limit is one of the strictest in the electronics industry and a concentration lower than the ban on lead in the European RoHS Directive . Since BFRs and PVC need to be present in much higher quantities to be effective , most materials that contain less than 900-ppm bromine and chlorine do not have any detectable levels of bromine or chlorine present . Q : Which products are covered by Apple's BFR-free and PVC-free transition ? A : Apple's phaseout of BFRs and PVC covers all parts of new Apple product designs manufactured after December 31 , 2008 . The iPod nano , iPod classic , and iPod touch are examples of products that are BFR-free and PVC-free . While Apple's phaseout will cover the vast majority of products and components , older product designs , replacement parts , and accessories for older product designs may not be fully BFR-free and PVC-free . Q : What is REACH , and how is Apple complying with the REACH regulation ? A : The Registration , Evaluation , Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation EC 1907 / 2007 , commonly referred to as REACH , is a European regulation on chemicals and their safe use . With the publication of the candidate list for authorization on October 28 , 2008 , the European Chemicals Agency identified a set of substances of very high concern ( SVHC ) that manufacturers must disclose to customers if used in their products above 0.1 percent . Based on the current version of the candidate list for authorization , Apple products do not contain SVHC above 0.1 percent , with the exception of AC power cords . AC power cords used in Apple notebooks , desktops , servers , displays , Apple TV , AirPort Extreme , Time Capsule , and power adapters are made of polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) that contains the SVHC bis 2-ethyl ( hexyl ) phthalate , also known as DEHP . Apple is in the final stages of developing and certifying PVC-free AC power cords that will also be free of DEHP . Q : Does Apple use ozone-depleting substances ? A : No ozone-depleting substances ( ODCs ) are used in any processes to manufacture components , materials , or product packaging materials used by Apple , as stipulated by the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer .

78	"I Bruno Bauer , The Jewish Question , Braunschweig , 1843 The German Jews desire emancipation . What kind of emancipation do they desire ? Civic , political emancipation . Bruno Bauer replies to them : No one in Germany is politically emancipated . We ourselves are not free . How are we to free you ? You Jews are egoists if you demand a special emancipation for yourselves as Jews . As Germans , you ought to work for the political emancipation of Germany , and as human beings , for the emancipation of mankind , and you should feel the particular kind of your oppression and your shame not as an exception to the rule , but on the contrary as a confirmation of the rule . Or do the Jews demand the same status as Christian subjects of the state ? In that case , they recognize that the Christian state is justified and they recognize , too , the regime of general oppression . Why should they disapprove of their special yoke if they approve of the general yoke ? Why should the German be interested in the liberation of the Jew , if the Jew is not interested in the liberation of the German ? The Christian state knows only privileges . In this state , the Jew has the privilege of being a Jew . As a Jew , he has rights which the Christians do not have . Why should he want rights which he does not have , but which the Christians enjoy ? In wanting to be emancipated from the Christian state , the Jew is demanding that the Christian state should give up its religious prejudice . Does he , the Jew , give up his religious prejudice ? Has he , then , the right to demand that someone else should renounce his religion ? By its very nature , the Christian state is incapable of emancipating the Jew ; but , adds Bauer , by his very nature the Jew can not be emancipated . So long as the state is Christian and the Jew is Jewish , the one is as incapable of granting emancipation as the other is of receiving it . The Christian state can behave towards the Jew only in the way characteristic of the Christian state – that is , by granting privileges , by permitting the separation of the Jew from the other subjects , but making him feel the pressure of all the other separate spheres of society , and feel it all the more intensely because he is in religious opposition to the dominant religion . But the Jew , too , can behave towards the state only in a Jewish way – that is , by treating it as something alien to him , by counterposing his imaginary nationality to the real nationality , by counterposing his illusory law to the real law , by deeming himself justified in separating himself from mankind , by abstaining on principle from taking part in the historical movement , by putting his trust in a future which has nothing in common with the future of mankind in general , and by seeing himself as a member of the Jewish people , and the Jewish people as the chosen people . On what grounds , then , do you Jews want emancipation ? On account of your religion ? It is the mortal enemy of the state religion . As citizens ? In Germany , there are no citizens . As human beings ? But you are no more human beings than those to whom you appeal . Bauer has posed the question of Jewish emancipation in a new form , after giving a critical analysis of the previous formulations and solutions of the question . What , he asks , is the nature of the Jew who is to be emancipated and of the Christian state that is to emancipate him ? He replies by a critique of the Jewish religion , he analyzes the religious opposition between Judaism and Christianity , he elucidates the essence of the Christian state – and he does all this audaciously , trenchantly , wittily , and with profundity , in a style of writing that is as precise as it is pithy and vigorous . How , then , does Bauer solve the Jewish question ? What is the result ? The formulation of a question is its solution . The critique of the Jewish question is the answer to the Jewish question . The summary , therefore , is as follows : We must emancipate ourselves before we can emancipate others . The most rigid form of the opposition between the Jew and the Christian is the religious opposition . How is an opposition resolved ? By making it impossible . How is religious opposition made impossible ? By abolishing religion . As soon as Jew and Christian recognize that their respective religions are no more than different stages in the development of the human mind , different snake skins cast off by history , and that man is the snake who sloughed them , the relation of Jew and Christian is no longer religious but is only a critical , scientific , and human relation . Science , then , constitutes their unity . But , contradictions in science are resolved by science itself . The German Jew , in particular , is confronted by the general absence of political emancipation and the strongly marked Christian character of the state . In Bauer's conception , however , the Jewish question has a universal significance , independent of specifically German conditions . It is the question of the relation of religion to the state , of the contradiction between religious constraint and political emancipation . Emancipation from religion is laid down as a condition , both to the Jew who wants to be emancipated politically , and to the state which is to effect emancipation and is itself to be emancipated . "" Very well , "" it is said , and the Jew himself says it , "" the Jew is to become emancipated not as a Jew , not because he is a Jew , not because he possesses such an excellent , universally human principle of morality ; on the contrary , the Jew will retreat behind the citizen and be a citizen , although he is a Jew and is to remain a Jew . That is to say , he is and remains a Jew , although he is a citizen and lives in universally human conditions : his Jewish and restricted nature triumphs always in the end over his human and political obligations . The prejudice remains in spite of being outstripped by general principles . But if it remains , then , on the contrary , it outstrips everything else . "" "" Only sophistically , only apparently , would the Jew be able to remain a Jew in the life of the state . Hence , if he wanted to remain a Jew , the mere appearance would become the essential and would triumph ; that is to say , his life in the state would be only a semblance or only a temporary exception to the essential and the rule . "" ( "" The Capacity of Present-Day Jews and Christians to Become Free , "" Einundzwanzig Bogen , pp. 57 ) Let us hear , on the other hand , how Bauer presents the task of the state . "" France , "" he says , "" has recently shown us "" ( Proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies , December 26 , 1840 ) "" in the connection with the Jewish question – just as it has continually done in all other political questions – the spectacle of a life which is free , but which revokes its freedom by law , hence declaring it to be an appearance , and on the other hand contradicting its free laws by its action . "" ( The Jewish Question , p. 64 ) "" In France , universal freedom is not yet the law , the Jewish question too has not yet been solved , because legal freedom – the fact that all citizens are equal – is restricted in actual life , which is still dominated and divided by religious privileges , and this lack of freedom in actual life reacts on law and compels the latter to sanction the division of the citizens , who as such are free , into oppressed and oppressors . "" ( p. 65 ) When , therefore , would the Jewish question be solved for France ? "" The Jew , for example , would have ceased to be a Jew if he did not allow himself to be prevented by his laws from fulfilling his duty to the state and his fellow citizens , that is , for example , if on the Sabbath he attended the Chamber of Deputies and took part in the official proceedings . Every religious privilege , and therefore also the monopoly of a privileged church , would have been abolished altogether , and if some or many persons , or even the overwhelming majority , still believed themselves bound to fulfil religious duties , this fulfilment ought to be left to them as a purely private matter . "" ( p. 65 ) "" There is no longer any religion when there is no longer any privileged religion . Take from religion its exclusive power and it will no longer exist . "" ( p. 66 ) "" Just as M. Martin du Nord saw the proposal to omit mention of Sunday in the law as a motion to declare that Christianity has ceased to exist , with equal reason ( and this reason is very well founded ) the declaration that the law of the Sabbath is no longer binding on the Jew would be a proclamation abolishing Judaism . "" ( p. 71 ) Bauer , therefore , demands , on the one hand , that the Jew should renounce Judaism , and that mankind in general should renounce religion , in order to achieve civic emancipation . On the other hand , he quite consistently regards the political abolition of religion as the abolition of religion as such . The state which presupposes religion is not yet a true , real state . "" Of course , the religious notion affords security to the state . But to what state ? To what kind of state ? "" ( p. 97 ) At this point , the one-sided formulation of the Jewish question becomes evident . It was by no means sufficient to investigate : Who is to emancipate ? Who is to be emancipated ? Criticism had to investigate a third point . It had to inquire : What kind of emancipation is in question ? What conditions follow from the very nature of the emancipation that is demanded ? Only the criticism of political emancipation itself would have been the conclusive criticism of the Jewish question and its real merging in the "" general question of time . "" Because Bauer does not raise the question to this level , he becomes entangled in contradictions . He puts forward conditions which are not based on the nature of political emancipation itself . He raises questions which are not part of his problem , and he solves problems which leave this question unanswered . When Bauer says of the opponents of Jewish emancipation : "" Their error was only that they assumed the Christian state to be the only true one and did not subject it to the same criticism that they applied to Judaism "" ( op . cit. , p. 3 ) , we find that his error lies in the fact that he subjects to criticism only the "" Christian state , "" not the "" state as such , "" that he does not investigate the relation of political emancipation to human emancipation and , therefore , puts forward conditions which can be explained only by uncritical confusion of political emancipation with general human emancipation . If Bauer asks the Jews : Have you , from your standpoint , the right to want political emancipation ? We ask the converse question : Does the standpoint of political emancipation give the right to demand from the Jew the abolition of Judaism and from man the abolition of religion ? The Jewish question acquires a different form depending on the state in which the Jew lives . In Germany , where there is no political state , no state as such , the Jewish question is a purely theological one . The Jew finds himself in religious opposition to the state , which recognizes Christianity as its basis . This state is a theologian ex professo . Criticism here is criticism of theology , a double-edged criticism – criticism of Christian theology and of Jewish theology . Hence , we continue to operate in the sphere of theology , however much we may operate critically within it . In France , a constitutional state , the Jewish question is a question of constitutionalism , the question of the incompleteness of political emancipation . Since the semblance of a state religion is retained here , although in a meaningless and self-contradictory formula , that of a religion of the majority , the relation of the Jew to the state retains the semblance of a religious , theological opposition . Only in the North American states – at least , in some of them – does the Jewish question lose its theological significance and become a really secular question . Only where the political state exists in its completely developed form can the relation of the Jew , and of the religious man in general , to the political state , and therefore the relation of religion to the state , show itself in its specific character , in its purity . The criticism of this relation ceases to be theological criticism as soon as the state ceases to adopt a theological attitude toward religion , as soon as it behaves towards religion as a state – i . e . , politically . Criticism , then , becomes criticism of the political state . At this point , where the question ceases to be theological , Bauer's criticism ceases to be critical . "" In the United States there is neither a state religion nor a religion declared to be that of the majority , nor the predominance of one cult over another . The state stands aloof from all cults . "" ( Marie ou l ' esclavage aux Etats-Unis , etc. , by G. de Beaumont , Paris , 1835 , p. 214 ) Indeed , there are some North American states where "" the constitution does not impose any religious belief or religious practice as a condition of political rights . "" ( op . cit. , p. 225 ) Nevertheless , "" in the United States people do not believe that a man without religion could be an honest man . "" ( op . cit. , p. 224 ) Nevertheless , North America is pre-eminently the country of religiosity , as Beaumont , Tocqueville , and the Englishman Hamilton unanimously assure us . The North American states , however , serve us only as an example . The question is : What is the relation of complete political emancipation to religion ? If we find that even in the country of complete political emancipation , religion not only exists , but displays a fresh and vigorous vitality , that is proof that the existence of religion is not in contradiction to the perfection of the state . Since , however , the existence of religion is the existence of defect , the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself . We no longer regard religion as the cause , but only as the manifestation of secular narrowness . Therefore , we explain the religious limitations of the free citizen by their secular limitations . We do not assert that they must overcome their religious narrowness in order to get rid of their secular restrictions , we assert that they will overcome their religious narrowness once they get rid of their secular restrictions . We do not turn secular questions into theological ones . History has long enough been merged in superstition , we now merge superstition in history . The question of the relation of political emancipation to religion becomes for us the question of the relation of political emancipation to human emancipation . We criticize the religious weakness of the political state by criticizing the political state in its secular form , apart from its weaknesses as regards religion . The contradiction between the state and a particular religion , for instance Judaism , is given by us a human form as the contradiction between the state and particular secular elements ; the contradiction between the state and religion in general as the contradiction between the state and its presuppositions in general . The political emancipation of the Jew , the Christian , and , in general , of religious man , is the emancipation of the state from Judaism , from Christianity , from religion in general . In its own form , in the manner characteristic of its nature , the state as a state emancipates itself from religion by emancipating itself from the state religion – that is to say , by the state as a state not professing any religion , but , on the contrary , asserting itself as a state . The political emancipation from religion is not a religious emancipation that has been carried through to completion and is free from contradiction , because political emancipation is not a form of human emancipation which has been carried through to completion and is free from contradiction . The limits of political emancipation are evident at once from the fact that the state can free itself from a restriction without man being really free from this restriction , that the state can be a free state [ pun on word Freistaat , which also means republic ] without man being a free man . Bauer himself tacitly admits this when he lays down the following condition for political emancipation : "" Every religious privilege , and therefore also the monopoly of a privileged church , would have been abolished altogether , and if some or many persons , or even the overwhelming majority , still believed themselves bound to fulfil religious duties , this fulfilment ought to be left to them as a purely private matter . "" [ The Jewish Question , p. 65 ] It is possible , therefore , for the state to have emancipated itself from religion even if the overwhelming majority is still religious . And the overwhelming majority does not cease to be religious through being religious in private . But , the attitude of the state , and of the republic [ free state ] in particular , to religion is , after all , only the attitude to religion of the men who compose the state . It follows from this that man frees himself through the medium of the state , that he frees himself politically from a limitation when , in contradiction with himself , he raises himself above this limitation in an abstract , limited , and partial way . It follows further that , by freeing himself politically , man frees himself in a roundabout way , through an intermediary , although an essential intermediary . It follows , finally , that man , even if he proclaims himself an atheist through the medium of the state – that is , if he proclaims the state to be atheist – still remains in the grip of religion , precisely because he acknowledges himself only by a roundabout route , only through an intermediary . Religion is precisely the recognition of man in a roundabout way , through an intermediary . The state is the intermediary between man and man's freedom . Just as Christ is the intermediary to whom man transfers the burden of all his divinity , all his religious constraint , so the state is the intermediary to whom man transfers all his non-divinity and all his human unconstraint . The political elevation of man above religion shares all the defects and all the advantages of political elevation in general . The state as a state annuls , for instance , private property , man declares by political means that private property is abolished as soon as the property qualification for the right to elect or be elected is abolished , as has occurred in many states of North America . Hamilton quite correctly interprets this fact from a political point of view as meaning : "" the masses have won a victory over the property owners and financial wealth . "" [ Thomas Hamilton , Men and Manners in America , 2 vols , Edinburgh , 1833 , p. 146 ] Is not private property abolished in idea if the non-property owner has become the legislator for the property owner ? The property qualification for the suffrage is the last political form of giving recognition to private property . Nevertheless , the political annulment of private property not only fails to abolish private property but even presupposes it . The state abolishes , in its own way , distinctions of birth , social rank , education , occupation , when it declares that birth , social rank , education , occupation , are non-political distinctions , when it proclaims , without regard to these distinction , that every member of the nation is an equal participant in national sovereignty , when it treats all elements of the real life of the nation from the standpoint of the state . Nevertheless , the state allows private property , education , occupation , to act in their way – i . e . , as private property , as education , as occupation , and to exert the influence of their special nature . Far from abolishing these real distinctions , the state only exists on the presupposition of their existence ; it feels itself to be a political state and asserts its universality only in opposition to these elements of its being . Hegel , therefore , defines the relation of the political state to religion quite correctly when he says : "" In order [ ... ] that the state should come into existence as the self-knowing , moral reality of the mind , its distraction from the form of authority and faith is essential . But this distinction emerges only insofar as the ecclesiastical aspect arrives at a separation within itself . It is only in this way that the state , above the particular churches , has achieved and brought into existence universality of thought , which is the principle of its form "" ( Hegel's Philosophy of Right , 1st edition , p. 346 ) . Of course ! Only in this way , above the particular elements , does the state constitute itself as universality . The perfect political state is , by its nature , man's species-life , as opposed to his material life . All the preconditions of this egoistic life continue to exist in civil society outside the sphere of the state , but as qualities of civil society . Where the political state has attained its true development , man – not only in thought , in consciousness , but in reality , in life – leads a twofold life , a heavenly and an earthly life : life in the political community , in which he considers himself a communal being , and life in civil society , in which he acts as a private individual , regards other men as a means , degrades himself into a means , and becomes the plaything of alien powers . The relation of the political state to civil society is just as spiritual as the relations of heaven to earth . The political state stands in the same opposition to civil society , and it prevails over the latter in the same way as religion prevails over the narrowness of the secular world – i . e . , by likewise having always to acknowledge it , to restore it , and allow itself to be dominated by it . In his most immediate reality , in civil society , man is a secular being . Here , where he regards himself as a real individual , and is so regarded by others , he is a fictitious phenomenon . In the state , on the other hand , where man is regarded as a species-being , he is the imaginary member of an illusory sovereignty , is deprived of his real individual life and endowed with an unreal universality . Man , as the adherent of a particular religion , finds himself in conflict with his citizenship and with other men as members of the community . This conflict reduces itself to the secular division between the political state and civil society . For man as a bourgeois [ i . e . , as a member of civil society , "" bourgeois society "" in German ] , "" life in the state "" is "" only a semblance or a temporary exception to the essential and the rule . "" Of course , the bourgeois , like the Jew , remains only sophistically in the sphere of political life , just as the citoyen [ ' citizen ' in French , i . e . , the participant in political life ] only sophistically remains a Jew or a bourgeois . But , this sophistry is not personal . It is the sophistry of the political state itself . The difference between the merchant and the citizen [ Staatsbürger ] , between the day-laborer and the citizen , between the landowner and the citizen , between the merchant and the citizen , between the living individual and the citizen . The contradiction in which the religious man finds himself with the political man is the same contradiction in which the bourgeois finds himself with the citoyen , and the member of civil society with his political lion's skin . This secular conflict , to which the Jewish question ultimately reduces itself , the relation between the political state and its preconditions , whether these are material elements , such as private property , etc. , or spiritual elements , such as culture or religion , the conflict between the general interest and private interest , the schism between the political state and civil society – these secular antitheses Bauer allows to persist , whereas he conducts a polemic against their religious expression . "" It is precisely the basis of civil society , the need that ensures the continuance of this society and guarantees its necessity , which exposes its existence to continual dangers , maintains in it an element of uncertainty , and produces that continually changing mixture of poverty and riches , of distress and prosperity , and brings about change in general . "" ( p. 8 ) Compare the whole section : "" Civil Society "" ( pp. 8-9 ) , which has been drawn up along the basic lines of Hegel's philosophy of law . Civil society , in its opposition to the political state , is recognized as necessary , because the political state is recognized as necessary . Political emancipation is , of course , a big step forward . True , it is not the final form of human emancipation in general , but it is the final form of human emancipation within the hitherto existing world order . It goes without saying that we are speaking here of real , practical emancipation . Man emancipates himself politically from religion by banishing it from the sphere of public law to that of private law . Religion is no longer the spirit of the state , in which man behaves – although in a limited way , in a particular form , and in a particular sphere – as a species-being , in community with other men . Religion has become the spirit of civil society , of the sphere of egoism , of bellum omnium contra omnes . It is no longer the essence of community , but the essence of difference . It has become the expression of man's separation from his community , from himself and from other men – as it was originally . It is only the abstract avowal of specific perversity , private whimsy , and arbitrariness . The endless fragmentation of religion in North America , for example , gives it even externally the form of a purely individual affair . It has been thrust among the multitude of private interests and ejected from the community as such . But one should be under no illusion about the limits of political emancipation . The division of the human being into a public man and a private man , the displacement of religion from the state into civil society , this is not a stage of political emancipation but its completion ; this emancipation , therefore , neither abolished the real religiousness of man , nor strives to do so . The decomposition of man into Jew and citizen , Protestant and citizen , religious man and citizen , is neither a deception directed against citizenhood , nor is it a circumvention of political emancipation , it is political emancipation itself , the political method of emancipating oneself from religion . Of course , in periods when the political state as such is born violently out of civil society , when political liberation is the form in which men strive to achieve their liberation , the state can and must go as far as the abolition of religion , the destruction of religion . But it can do so only in the same way that it proceeds to the abolition of private property , to the maximum , to confiscation , to progressive taxation , just as it goes as far as the abolition of life , the guillotine . At times of special self-confidence , political life seeks to suppress its prerequisite , civil society and the elements composing this society , and to constitute itself as the real species-life of man , devoid of contradictions . But , it can achieve this only by coming into violent contradiction with its own conditions of life , only by declaring the revolution to be permanent , and , therefore , the political drama necessarily ends with the re-establishment of religion , private property , and all elements of civil society , just as war ends with peace . Indeed , the perfect Christian state is not the so-called Christian state – which acknowledges Christianity as its basis , as the state religion , and , therefore , adopts an exclusive attitude towards other religions . On the contrary , the perfect Christian state is the atheistic state , the democratic state , the state which relegates religion to a place among the other elements of civil society . The state which is still theological , which still officially professes Christianity as its creed , which still does not dare to proclaim itself as a state , has , in its reality as a state , not yet succeeded in expressing the human basis – of which Christianity is the high-flown expression – in a secular , human form . The so-called Christian state is simply nothing more than a non-state , since it is not Christianity as a religion , but only the human background of the Christian religion , which can find its expression in actual human creations . The so-called Christian state is the Christian negation of the state , but by no means the political realization of Christianity . The state which still professes Christianity in the form of religion , does not yet profess it in the form appropriate to the state , for it still has a religious attitude towards religion – that is to say , it is not the true implementation of the human basis of religion , because it still relies on the unreal , imaginary form of this human core . The so-called Christian state is the imperfect state , and the Christian religion is regarded by it as the supplementation and sanctification of its imperfection . For the Christian state , therefore , religion necessarily becomes a means ; hence , it is a hypocritical state . It makes a great difference whether the complete state , because of the defect inherent in the general nature of the state , counts religion among its presuppositions , or whether the incomplete state , because of the defect inherent in its particular existence as a defective state , declares that religion is its basis . In the latter case , religion becomes imperfect politics . In the former case , the imperfection even of consummate politics becomes evident in religion . The so-called Christian state needs the Christian religion in order to complete itself as a state . The democratic state , the real state , does not need religion for its political completion . On the contrary , it can disregard religion because in it the human basis of religion is realized in a secular manner . The so-called Christian state , on the other hand , has a political attitude to religion and a religious attitude to politics . By degrading the forms of the state to mere semblance , it equally degrades religion to mere semblance . In order to make this contradiction clearer , let us consider Bauer's projection of the Christian state , a projection based on his observation of the Christian-German state . "" Recently , "" says Bauer , "" in order to prove the impossibility or non-existence of a Christian state , reference has frequently been made to those sayings in the Gospel with which the [ present-day ] state not only does not comply , but can not possibly comply , if it does not want to dissolve itself completely [ as a state ] . "" "" But the matter can not be disposed of so easily . What do these Gospel sayings demand ? Supernatural renunciation of self , submission to the authority of revelation , a turning-away from the state , the abolition of secular conditions . Well , the Christian state demands and accomplishes all that . It has assimilated the spirit of the Gospel , and if it does not reproduce this spirit in the same terms as the Gospel , that occurs only because it expresses this spirit in political forms , i . e . , in forms which , it is true , are taken from the political system in this world , but which in the religious rebirth that they have to undergo become degraded to a mere semblance . This is a turning-away from the state while making use of political forms for its realization . "" ( p. 55 ) Bauer then explains that the people of a Christian state is only a non-people , no longer having a will of its own , but whose true existence lies in the leader to whom it is subjected , although this leader by his origin and nature is alien to it – i . e . , given by God and imposed on the people without any co-operation on its part . Bauer declares that the laws of such a people are not its own creation , but are actual revelations , that its supreme chief needs privileged intermediaries with the people in the strict sense , with the masses , and that the masses themselves are divided into a multitude of particular groupings which are formed and determined by chance , which are differentiated by their interests , their particular passions and prejudices , and obtain permission as a privilege , to isolate themselves from one another , etc. ( p. 56 ) However , Bauer himself says : "" Politics , if it is to be nothing but religion , ought not to be politics , just as the cleaning of saucepans , if it is to be accepted as a religious matter , ought not to be regarded as a matter of domestic economy . "" ( p. 108 ) In the Christian-German state , however , religion is an "" economic matter "" just as "" economic matters "" belong to the sphere of religion . The domination of religion in the Christian-German state is the religion of domination . The separation of the "" spirit of the Gospel "" from the "" letter of the Gospel "" is an irreligious act . A state which makes the Gospel speak in the language of politics – that is , in another language than that of the Holy Ghost – commits sacrilege , if not in human eyes , then in the eyes of its own religion . The state which acknowledges Christianity as its supreme criterion , and the Bible as its Charter , must be confronted with the words of Holy Scripture , for every word of Scripture is holy . This state , as well as the human rubbish on which it is based , is caught in a painful contradiction that is insoluble from the standpoint of religious consciousness when it is referred to those sayings of the Gospel with which it "" not only does not comply , but can not possibly comply , if it does not want to dissolve itself completely as a state . "" And why does it not want to dissolve itself completely ? The state itself can not give an answer either to itself or to others . In its own consciousness , the official Christian state is an imperative , the realization of which is unattainable , the state can assert the reality of its existence only by lying to itself , and therefore always remains in its own eyes an object of doubt , an unreliable , problematic object . Criticism is , therefore , fully justified in forcing the state that relies on the Bible into a mental derangement in which it no longer knows whether it is an illusion or a reality , and in which the infamy of its secular aims , for which religion serves as a cloak , comes into insoluble conflict with the sincerity of its religious consciousness , for which religion appears as the aim of the world . This state can only save itself from its inner torment if it becomes the police agent of the Catholic Church . In relation to the church , which declares the secular power to be its servant , the state is powerless , the secular power which claims to be the rule of the religious spirit is powerless . It is , indeed , estrangement which matters in the so-called Christian state , but not man . The only man who counts , the king , is a being specifically different from other men , and is , moreover , a religious being , directly linked with heaven , with God . The relationships which prevail here are still relationships dependent of faith . The religious spirit , therefore , is still not really secularized . But , furthermore , the religious spirit can not be really secularized , for what is it in itself but the non-secular form of a stage in the development of the human mind ? The religious spirit can only be secularized insofar as the stage of development of the human mind of which it is the religious expression makes its appearance and becomes constituted in its secular form . This takes place in the democratic state . Not Christianity , but the human basis of Christianity is the basis of this state . Religion remains the ideal , non-secular consciousness of its members , because religion is the ideal form of the stage of human development achieved in this state . The members of the political state are religious owing to the dualism between individual life and species-life , between the life of civil society and political life . They are religious because men treat the political life of the state , an area beyond their real individuality , as if it were their true life . They are religious insofar as religion here is the spirit of civil society , expressing the separation and remoteness of man from man . Political democracy is Christian since in it man , not merely one man but everyman , ranks as sovereign , as the highest being , but it is man in his uncivilized , unsocial form , man in his fortuitous existence , man just as he is , man as he has been corrupted by the whole organization of our society , who has lost himself , been alienated , and handed over to the rule of inhuman conditions and elements – in short , man who is not yet a real species-being . That which is a creation of fantasy , a dream , a postulate of Christianity , i . e . , the sovereignty of man – but man as an alien being different from the real man – becomes , in democracy , tangible reality , present existence , and secular principle . In the perfect democracy , the religious and theological consciousness itself is in its own eyes the more religious and the more theological because it is apparently without political significance , without worldly aims , the concern of a disposition that shuns the world , the expression of intellectual narrow-mindedness , the product of arbitrariness and fantasy , and because it is a life that is really of the other world . Christianity attains , here , the practical expression of its universal-religious significance in that the most diverse world outlooks are grouped alongside one another in the form of Christianity and still more because it does not require other people to profess Christianity , but only religion in general , any kind of religion ( cf. Beaumont's work quoted above ) . The religious consciousness revels in the wealth of religious contradictions and religious diversity . We have , thus , shown that political emancipation from religion leaves religion in existence , although not a privileged religion . The contradiction in which the adherent of a particular religion finds himself involved in relation to his citizenship is only one aspect of the universal secular contradiction between the political state and civil society . The consummation of the Christian state is the state which acknowledges itself as a state and disregards the religion of its members . The emancipation of the state from religion is not the emancipation of the real man from religion . Therefore , we do not say to the Jews , as Bauer does : You can not be emancipated politically without emancipating yourselves radically from Judaism . On the contrary , we tell them : Because you can be emancipated politically without renouncing Judaism completely and incontrovertibly , political emancipation itself is not human emancipation . If you Jews want to be emancipated politically , without emancipating yourselves humanly , the half-hearted approach and contradiction is not in you alone , it is inherent in the nature and category of political emancipation . If you find yourself within the confines of this category , you share in a general confinement . Just as the state evangelizes when , although it is a state , it adopts a Christian attitude towards the Jews , so the Jew acts politically when , although a Jew , he demands civic rights . But , if a man , although a Jew , can be emancipated politically and receive civic rights , can he lay claim to the so-called rights of man and receive them ? Bauer denies it . "" The question is whether the Jew as such , that is , the Jew who himself admits that he is compelled by his true nature to live permanently in separation from other men , is capable of receiving the universal rights of man and of conceding them to others . "" "" For the Christian world , the idea of the rights of man was only discovered in the last century . It is not innate in men ; on the contrary , it is gained only in a struggle against the historical traditions in which hitherto man was brought up . Thus the rights of man are not a gift of nature , not a legacy from past history , but the reward of the struggle against the accident of birth and against the privileges which up to now have been handed down by history from generation to generation . These rights are the result of culture , and only one who has earned and deserved them can possess them . "" "" Can the Jew really take possession of them ? As long as he is a Jew , the restricted nature which makes him a Jew is bound to triumph over the human nature which should link him as a man with other men , and will separate him from non-Jews . He declares by this separation that the particular nature which makes him a Jew is his true , highest nature , before which human nature has to give way . "" "" Similarly , the Christian as a Christian can not grant the rights of man . "" ( p. 19-20 ) According to Bauer , man has to sacrifice the "" privilege of faith "" to be able to receive the universal rights of man . Let us examine , for a moment , the so-called rights of man – to be precise , the rights of man in their authentic form , in the form which they have among those who discovered them , the North Americans and the French . These rights of man are , in part , political rights , rights which can only be exercised in community with others . Their content is participation in the community , and specifically in the political community , in the life of the state . They come within the category of political freedom , the category of civic rights , which , as we have seen , in no way presuppose the incontrovertible and positive abolition of religion – nor , therefore , of Judaism . There remains to be examined the other part of the rights of man – the droits d ' homme , insofar as these differ from the droits d ' citoyen . Included among them is freedom of conscience , the right to practice any religion one chooses . The privilege of faith is expressly recognized either as a right of man or as the consequence of a right of man , that of liberty . Déclaration des droits de l ' droits et du citoyen , 1791 , Article 10 : "" No one is to be subjected to annoyance because of his opinions , even religious opinions . "" "" The freedom of every man to practice the religion of which he is an adherent . "" Declaration of the Rights of Man , etc. , 1793 , includes among the rights of man , Article 7 : "" The free exercise of religion . "" Indeed , in regard to man's right to express his thoughts and opinions , to hold meetings , and to exercise his religion , it is even stated : "" The necessity of proclaiming these rights presupposes either the existence or the recent memory of despotism . "" Compare the Constitution of 1795 , Section XIV , Article 354 . Constitution of Pennsylvania , Article 9 , § 3 : "" All men have received from nature the imprescriptible right to worship the Almighty according to the dictates of their conscience , and no one can be legally compelled to follow , establish , or support against his will any religion or religious ministry . No human authority can , in any circumstances , intervene in a matter of conscience or control the forces of the soul . "" Constitution of New Hampshire , Article 5 and 6 : "" Among these natural rights some are by nature inalienable since nothing can replace them . The rights of conscience are among them . "" ( Beaumont , op . cit. , pp. 213,214 ) Incompatibility between religion and the rights of man is to such a degree absent from the concept of the rights of man that , on the contrary , a man's right to be religious , in any way he chooses , to practise his own particular religion , is expressly included among the rights of man . The privilege of faith is a universal right of man . The droits de l ' homme , the rights of man , are , as such , distinct from the droits du citoyen , the rights of the citizen . Who is homme as distinct from citoyen ? None other than the member of civil society . Why is the member of civil society called "" man , "" simply man ; why are his rights called the rights of man ? How is this fact to be explained ? From the relationship between the political state and civil society , from the nature of political emancipation . Above all , we note the fact that the so-called rights of man , the droits de l ' homme as distinct from the droits du citoyen , are nothing but the rights of a member of civil society – i . e . , the rights of egoistic man , of man separated from other men and from the community . Let us hear what the most radical Constitution , the Constitution of 1793 , has to say : Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen . Article 2 . "" These rights , etc. , ( the natural and imprescriptible rights ) are : equality , liberty , security , property . "" What constitutes liberty ? Article 6 . "" Liberty is the power which man has to do everything that does not harm the rights of others , "" or , according to the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1791 : "" Liberty consists in being able to do everything which does not harm others . "" Liberty , therefore , is the right to do everything that harms no one else . The limits within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law , just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post . It is a question of the liberty of man as an isolated monad , withdrawn into himself . Why is the Jew , according to Bauer , incapable of acquiring the rights of man ? "" As long as he is a Jew , the restricted nature which makes him a Jew is bound to triumph over the human nature which should link him as a man with other men , and will separate him from non-Jews . "" But , the right of man to liberty is based not on the association of man with man , but on the separation of man from man . It is the right of this separation , the right of the restricted individual , withdrawn into himself . The practical application of man's right to liberty is man's right to private property . What constitutes man's right to private property ? Article 16 . ( Constitution of 1793 ) : "" The right of property is that which every citizen has of enjoying and of disposing at his discretion of his goods and income , of the fruits of his labor and industry . "" The right of man to private property is , therefore , the right to enjoy one's property and to dispose of it at one's discretion ( à son gré ) , without regard to other men , independently of society , the right of self-interest . This individual liberty and its application form the basis of civil society . It makes every man see in other men not the realization of his own freedom , but the barrier to it . But , above all , it proclaims the right of man "" of enjoying and of disposing at his discretion of his goods and income , of the fruits of his labor and industry . "" There remain the other rights of man : égalité and sûreté . Equality , used here in its non-political sense , is nothing but the equality of the liberté described above – namely : each man is to the same extent regarded as such a self-sufficient monad . The Constitution of 1795 defines the concept of this equality , in accordance with this significance , as follows : Article 3 ( Constitution of 1795 ) : "" Equality consists in the law being the same for all , whether it protects or punishes . "" And security ? Article 8 ( Constitution of 1793 ) : "" Security consists in the protection afforded by society to each of its members for the preservation of his person , his rights , and his property . "" Security is the highest social concept of civil society , the concept of police , expressing the fact that the whole of society exists only in order to guarantee to each of its members the preservation of his person , his rights , and his property . It is in this sense that Hegel calls civil society "" the state of need and reason . "" The concept of security does not raise civil society above its egoism . On the contrary , security is the insurance of egoism . None of the so-called rights of man , therefore , go beyond egoistic man , beyond man as a member of civil society – that is , an individual withdrawn into himself , into the confines of his private interests and private caprice , and separated from the community . In the rights of man , he is far from being conceived as a species-being ; on the contrary , species-like itself , society , appears as a framework external to the individuals , as a restriction of their original independence . The sole bond holding them together is natural necessity , need and private interest , the preservation of their property and their egoistic selves . It is puzzling enough that a people which is just beginning to liberate itself , to tear down all the barriers between its various sections , and to establish a political community , that such a people solemnly proclaims ( Declaration of 1791 ) the rights of egoistic man separated from his fellow men and from the community , and that indeed it repeats this proclamation at a moment when only the most heroic devotion can save the nation , and is therefore imperatively called for , at a moment when the sacrifice of all the interest of civil society must be the order of the day , and egoism must be punished as a crime . ( Declaration of the Rights of Man , etc. , of 1793 ) This fact becomes still more puzzling when we see that the political emancipators go so far as to reduce citizenship , and the political community , to a mere means for maintaining these so-called rights of man , that , therefore , the citoyen is declared to be the servant of egotistic homme , that the sphere in which man acts as a communal being is degraded to a level below the sphere in which he acts as a partial being , and that , finally , it is not man as citoyen , but man as private individual [ bourgeois ] who is considered to be the essential and true man . "" The aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man . "" ( Declaration of the Rights , etc. , of 1791 , Article 2 ) "" Government is instituted in order to guarantee man the enjoyment of his natural and imprescriptible rights . "" ( Declaration , etc. , of 1793 , Article 1 ) Hence , even in moments when its enthusiasm still has the freshness of youth and is intensified to an extreme degree by the force of circumstances , political life declares itself to be a mere means , whose purpose is the life of civil society . It is true that its revolutionary practice is in flagrant contradiction with its theory . Whereas , for example , security is declared one of the rights of man , violation of the privacy of correspondence is openly declared to be the order of the day . Whereas "" unlimited freedom of the press "" ( Constitution of 1793 , Article 122 ) is guaranteed as a consequence of the right of man to individual liberty , freedom of the press is totally destroyed , because "" freedom of the press should not be permitted when it endangers public liberty . "" ( "" Robespierre jeune , "" Historie parlementaire de la Révolution française by Buchez and Roux , vol. 28 , p. 159 ) That is to say , therefore : The right of man to liberty ceases to be a right as soon as it comes into conflict with political life , whereas in theory political life is only the guarantee of human rights , the rights of the individual , and therefore must be abandoned as soon as it comes into contradiction with its aim , with these rights of man . But , practice is merely the exception , theory is the rule . But even if one were to regard revolutionary practice as the correct presentation of the relationship , there would still remain the puzzle of why the relationship is turned upside-down in the minds of the political emancipators and the aim appears as the means , while the means appears as the aim . This optical illusion of their consciousness would still remain a puzzle , although now a psychological , a theoretical puzzle . The puzzle is easily solved . Political emancipation is , at the same time , the dissolution of the old society on which the state alienated from the people , the sovereign power , is based . What was the character of the old society ? It can be described in one word – feudalism . The character of the old civil society was directly political – that is to say , the elements of civil life , for example , property , or the family , or the mode of labor , were raised to the level of elements of political life in the form of seigniory , estates , and corporations . In this form , they determined the relation of the individual to the state as a whole – i . e . , his political relation , that is , his relation of separation and exclusion from the other components of society . For that organization of national life did not raise property or labor to the level of social elements ; on the contrary , it completed their separation from the state as a whole and constituted them as discrete societies within society . Thus , the vital functions and conditions of life of civil society remained , nevertheless , political , although political in the feudal sense – that is to say , they secluded the individual from the state as a whole and they converted the particular relation of his corporation to the state as a whole into his general relation to the life of the nation , just as they converted his particular civil activity and situation into his general activity and situation . As a result of this organization , the unity of the state , and also the consciousness , will , and activity of this unity , the general power of the state , are likewise bound to appear as the particular affair of a ruler and of his servants , isolated from the people . The political revolution which overthrew this sovereign power and raised state affairs to become affairs of the people , which constituted the political state as a matter of general concern , that is , as a real state , necessarily smashed all estates , corporations , guilds , and privileges , since they were all manifestations of the separation of the people from the community . The political revolution thereby abolished the political character of civil society . It broke up civil society into its simple component parts ; on the one hand , the individuals ; on the other hand , the material and spiritual elements constituting the content of the life and social position of these individuals . It set free the political spirit , which had been , as it were , split up , partitioned , and dispersed in the various blind alleys of feudal society . It gathered the dispersed parts of the political spirit , freed it from its intermixture with civil life , and established it as the sphere of the community , the general concern of the nation , ideally independent of those particular elements of civil life . A person's distinct activity and distinct situation in life were reduced to a merely individual significance . They no longer constituted the general relation of the individual to the state as a whole . Public affairs as such , on the other hand , became the general affair of each individual , and the political function became the individual's general function . But , the completion of the idealism of the state was at the same time the completion of the materialism of civil society . Throwing off the political yoke meant at the same time throwing off the bonds which restrained the egoistic spirit of civil society . Political emancipation was , at the same time , the emancipation of civil society from politics , from having even the semblance of a universal content . Feudal society was resolved into its basic element – man , but man as he really formed its basis – egoistic man . This man , the member of civil society , is thus the basis , the precondition , of the political state . He is recognized as such by this state in the rights of man . The liberty of egoistic man and the recognition of this liberty , however , is rather the recognition of the unrestrained movement of the spiritual and material elements which form the content of his life . Hence , man was not freed from religion , he received religious freedom . He was not freed from property , he received freedom to own property . He was not freed from the egoism of business , he received freedom to engage in business . The establishment of the political state and the dissolution of civil society into independent individuals – whose relation with one another on law , just as the relations of men in the system of estates and guilds depended on privilege – is accomplished by one and the same act . Man as a member of civil society , unpolitical man , inevitably appears , however , as the natural man . The "" rights of man "" appears as "" natural rights , "" because conscious activity is concentrated on the political act . Egoistic man is the passive result of the dissolved society , a result that is simply found in existence , an object of immediate certainty , therefore a natural object . The political revolution resolves civil life into its component parts , without revolutionizing these components themselves or subjecting them to criticism . It regards civil society , the world of needs , labor , private interests , civil law , as the basis of its existence , as a precondition not requiring further substantiation and therefore as its natural basis . Finally , man as a member of civil society is held to be man in his sensuous , individual , immediate existence , whereas political man is only abstract , artificial man , man as an allegorical , juridical person . The real man is recognized only in the shape of the egoistic individual , the true man is recognized only in the shape of the abstract citizen . Therefore , Rousseau correctly described the abstract idea of political man as follows : "" Whoever dares undertake to establish a people's institutions must feel himself capable of changing , as it were , human nature , of transforming each individual , who by himself is a complete and solitary whole , into a part of a larger whole , from which , in a sense , the individual receives his life and his being , of substituting a limited and mental existence for the physical and independent existence . He has to take from man his own powers , and give him in exchange alien powers which he can not employ without the help of other men . "" All emancipation is a reduction of the human world and relationships to man himself . Political emancipation is the reduction of man , on the one hand , to a member of civil society , to an egoistic , independent individual , and , on the other hand , to a citizen , a juridical person . Only when the real , individual man re-absorbs in himself the abstract citizen , and as an individual human being has become a species-being in his everyday life , in his particular work , and in his particular situation , only when man has recognized and organized his "" own powers "" as social powers , and , consequently , no longer separates social power from himself in the shape of political power , only then will human emancipation have been accomplished . II Bruno Bauer , "" The Capacity of Present-day Jews and Christians to Become Free , "" Einundzwanzig Bogen aus der Schweiz , pp. 56-71 It is in this form that Bauer deals with the relation between the Jewish and the Christian religions , and also with their relation to criticism . Their relation to criticism is their relation "" to the capacity to become free . "" The result arrived at is : "" The Christian has to surmount only one stage , namely , that of his religion , in order to give up religion altogether , "" and therefore become free . "" The Jew , on the other hand , has to break not only with his Jewish nature , but also with the development towards perfecting his religion , a development which has remained alien to him . "" ( p. 71 ) Thus , Bauer here transforms the question of Jewish emancipation into a purely religious question . The theological problem as to whether the Jew or the Christian has the better prospect of salvation is repeated here in the enlightened form : which of them is more capable of emancipation . No longer is the question asked : Is it Judaism or Christianity that makes a man free ? On the contrary , the question is now : Which makes man freer , the negation of Judaism or the negation of Christianity ? "" If the Jews want to become free , they should profess belief not in Christianity , but in the dissolution of Christianity , in the dissolution of religion in general , that is to say , in enlightenment , criticism , and its consequences , free humanity . "" ( p. 70 ) For the Jew , it is still a matter of a profession of faith , but no longer a profession of belief in Christianity , but of belief in Christianity in dissolution . Bauer demands of the Jews that they should break with the essence of the Christian religion , a demand which , as he says himself , does not arise out of the development of Judaism . Since Bauer , at the end of his work on the Jewish question , had conceived Judaism only as crude religious criticism of Christianity , and therefore saw in it "" merely "" a religious significance , it could be foreseen that the emancipation of the Jews , too , would be transformed into a philosophical-theological act . Bauer considers that the ideal , abstract nature of the Jew , his religion , is his entire nature . Hence , he rightly concludes : "" The Jew contributes nothing to mankind if he himself disregards his narrow law , "" if he invalidates his entire Judaism . ( p. 65 ) Accordingly , the relation between Jews and Christians becomes the following : the sole interest of the Christian in the emancipation of the Jew is a general human interest , a theoretical interest . Judaism is a fact that offends the religious eye of the Christian . As soon as his eye ceases to be religious , this fact ceases to be offensive . The emancipation of the Jew is , in itself , not a task for the Christian . The Jew , on the other hand , in order to emancipate himself , has to carry out not only his own work , but also that of the Christian – i . e . , the Critique of the Evangelical History of the Synoptics and the Life of Jesus , etc. "" It is up to them to deal with it : they themselves will decide their fate ; but history is not to be trifled with . "" ( p. 71 ) We are trying to break with the theological formulation of the question . For us , the question of the Jew's capacity for emancipation becomes the question : What particular social element has to be overcome in order to abolish Judaism ? For the present-day Jew's capacity for emancipation is the relation of Judaism to the emancipation of the modern world . This relation necessarily results from the special position of Judaism in the contemporary enslaved world . Let us consider the actual , worldly Jew – not the Sabbath Jew , as Bauer does , but the everyday Jew . Let us not look for the secret of the Jew in his religion , but let us look for the secret of his religion in the real Jew . What is the secular basis of Judaism ? Practical need , self-interest . What is the worldly religion of the Jew ? Huckstering . What is his worldly God ? Money . Very well then ! Emancipation from huckstering and money , consequently from practical , real Judaism , would be the self-emancipation of our time . An organization of society which would abolish the preconditions for huckstering , and therefore the possibility of huckstering , would make the Jew impossible . His religious consciousness would be dissipated like a thin haze in the real , vital air of society . On the other hand , if the Jew recognizes that this practical nature of his is futile and works to abolish it , he extricates himself from his previous development and works for human emancipation as such and turns against the supreme practical expression of human self-estrangement . We recognize in Judaism , therefore , a general anti-social element of the present time , an element which through historical development – to which in this harmful respect the Jews have zealously contributed – has been brought to its present high level , at which it must necessarily begin to disintegrate . In the final analysis , the emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism . The Jew has already emancipated himself in a Jewish way . "" The Jew , who in Vienna , for example , is only tolerated , determines the fate of the whole Empire by his financial power . The Jew , who may have no rights in the smallest German state , decides the fate of Europe . While corporations and guilds refuse to admit Jews , or have not yet adopted a favorable attitude towards them , the audacity of industry mocks at the obstinacy of the material institutions . "" ( Bruno Bauer , The Jewish Question , p. 114 ) This is no isolated fact . The Jew has emancipated himself in a Jewish manner , not only because he has acquired financial power , but also because , through him and also apart from him , money has become a world power and the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations . The Jews have emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians have become Jews . Captain Hamilton , for example , reports : "" The devout and politically free inhabitant of New England is a kind of Laocoön who makes not the least effort to escape from the serpents which are crushing him . Mammon is his idol which he adores not only with his lips but with the whole force of his body and mind . In his view the world is no more than a Stock Exchange , and he is convinced that he has no other destiny here below than to become richer than his neighbor . Trade has seized upon all his thoughts , and he has no other recreation than to exchange objects . When he travels he carries , so to speak , his goods and his counter on his back and talks only of interest and profit . If he loses sight of his own business for an instant it is only in order to pry into the business of his competitors . "" Indeed , in North America , the practical domination of Judaism over the Christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the Gospel itself and the Christian ministry have become articles of trade , and the bankrupt trader deals in the Gospel just as the Gospel preacher who has become rich goes in for business deals . "" The man who you see at the head of a respectable congregation began as a trader ; his business having failed , he became a minister . The other began as a priest but as soon as he had some money at his disposal he left the pulpit to become a trader . In the eyes of very many people , the religious ministry is a veritable business career . "" ( Beaumont , op . cit. , pp. 185,186 ) According to Bauer , it is "" a fictitious state of affairs when in theory the Jew is deprived of political rights , whereas in practice he has immense power and exerts his political influence en gros , although it is curtailed en détail . "" ( Die Judenfrage , p. 114 ) The contradiction that exists between the practical political power of the Jew and his political rights is the contradiction between politics and the power of money in general . Although theoretically the former is superior to the latter , in actual fact politics has become the serf of financial power . Judaism has held its own alongside Christianity , not only as religious criticism of Christianity , not only as the embodiment of doubt in the religious derivation of Christianity , but equally because the practical Jewish spirit , Judaism , has maintained itself and even attained its highest development in Christian society . The Jew , who exists as a distinct member of civil society , is only a particular manifestation of the Judaism of civil society . Judaism continues to exist not in spite of history , but owing to history . The Jew is perpetually created by civil society from its own entrails . What , in itself , was the basis of the Jewish religion ? Practical need , egoism . The monotheism of the Jew , therefore , is in reality the polytheism of the many needs , a polytheism which makes even the lavatory an object of divine law . Practical need , egoism , is the principle of civil society , and as such appears in pure form as soon as civil society has fully given birth to the political state . The god of practical need and self-interest is money . Money is the jealous god of Israel , in face of which no other god may exist . Money degrades all the gods of man – and turns them into commodities . Money is the universal self-established value of all things . It has , therefore , robbed the whole world – both the world of men and nature – of its specific value . Money is the estranged essence of man's work and man's existence , and this alien essence dominates him , and he worships it . The god of the Jews has become secularized and has become the god of the world . The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew . His god is only an illusory bill of exchange . The view of nature attained under the domination of private property and money is a real contempt for , and practical debasement of , nature ; in the Jewish religion , nature exists , it is true , but it exists only in imagination . It is in this sense that [ in a 1524 pamphlet ] Thomas Münzer declares it intolerable "" that all creatures have been turned into property , the fishes in the water , the birds in the air , the plants on the earth ; the creatures , too , must become free . "" Contempt for theory , art , history , and for man as an end in himself , which is contained in an abstract form in the Jewish religion , is the real , conscious standpoint , the virtue of the man of money . The species-relation itself , the relation between man and woman , etc. , becomes an object of trade ! The woman is bought and sold . The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant , of the man of money in general . The groundless law of the Jew is only a religious caricature of groundless morality and right in general , of the purely formal rites with which the world of self-interest surrounds itself . Here , too , man's supreme relation is the legal one , his relation to laws that are valid for him not because they are laws of his own will and nature , but because they are the dominant laws and because departure from them is avenged . Jewish Jesuitism , the same practical Jesuitism which Bauer discovers in the Talmud , is the relation of the world of self-interest to the laws governing that world , the chief art of which consists in the cunning circumvention of these laws . Indeed , the movement of this world within its framework of laws is bound to be a continual suspension of law . Judaism could not develop further as a religion , could not develop further theoretically , because the world outlook of practical need is essentially limited and is completed in a few strokes . By its very nature , the religion of practical need could find its consummation not in theory , but only in practice , precisely because its truth is practice . Judaism could not create a new world ; it could only draw the new creations and conditions of the world into the sphere of its activity , because practical need , the rationale of which is self-interest , is passive and does not expand at will , but finds itself enlarged as a result of the continuous development of social conditions . Judaism reaches its highest point with the perfection of civil society , but it is only in the Christian world that civil society attains perfection . Only under the dominance of Christianity , which makes all national , natural , moral , and theoretical conditions extrinsic to man , could civil society separate itself completely from the life of the state , sever all the species-ties of man , put egoism and selfish need in the place of these species-ties , and dissolve the human world into a world of atomistic individuals who are inimically opposed to one another . Christianity sprang from Judaism . It has merged again in Judaism . From the outset , the Christian was the theorizing Jew , the Jew is , therefore , the practical Christian , and the practical Christian has become a Jew again . Christianity had only in semblance overcome real Judaism . It was too noble-minded , too spiritualistic to eliminate the crudity of practical need in any other way than by elevation to the skies . Christianity is the sublime thought of Judaism , Judaism is the common practical application of Christianity , but this application could only become general after Christianity as a developed religion had completed theoretically the estrangement of man from himself and from nature . Only then could Judaism achieve universal dominance and make alienated man and alienated nature into alienable , vendible objects subjected to the slavery of egoistic need and to trading . Selling [ Veräußerung ] is the practical aspect of alienation [ Entäußerung ] . Just as man , as long as he is in the grip of religion , is able to objectify his essential nature only by turning it into something alien , something fantastic , so under the domination of egoistic need he can be active practically , and produce objects in practice , only by putting his products , and his activity , under the domination of an alien being , and bestowing the significance of an alien entity – money – on them . In its perfected practice , Christian egoism of heavenly bliss is necessarily transformed into the corporal egoism of the Jew , heavenly need is turned into world need , subjectivism into self-interest . We explain the tenacity of the Jew not by his religion , but , on the contrary , by the human basis of his religion – practical need , egoism . Since in civil society the real nature of the Jew has been universally realized and secularized , civil society could not convince the Jew of the unreality of his religious nature , which is indeed only the ideal aspect of practical need . Consequently , not only in the Pentateuch and the Talmud , but in present-day society we find the nature of the modern Jew , and not as an abstract nature but as one that is in the highest degree empirical , not merely as a narrowness of the Jew , but as the Jewish narrowness of society . Once society has succeeded in abolishing the empirical essence of Judaism – huckstering and its preconditions – the Jew will have become impossible , because his consciousness no longer has an object , because the subjective basis of Judaism , practical need , has been humanized , and because the conflict between man's individual-sensuous existence and his species-existence has been abolished . The social emancipation of the Jew is the emancipation of society from Judaism ."	0
48	"CHAPTER XXXIII When Mr. St. John went , it was beginning to snow ; the whirling storm continued all night . The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding falls ; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable . I had closed my shutter , laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from blowing in under it , trimmed my fire , and after sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest , I lit a candle , took down "" Marmion , "" and beginning -- "" Day set on Norham's castled steep , And Tweed's fair river broad and deep , And Cheviot's mountains lone ; The massive towers , the donjon keep , The flanking walls that round them sweep , In yellow lustre shone "" -- I soon forgot storm in music . I heard a noise : the wind , I thought , shook the door . No ; it was St. John Rivers , who , lifting the latch , came in out of the frozen hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me : the cloak that covered his tall figure all white as a glacier . I was almost in consternation , so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up vale that night . "" Any ill news ? "" I demanded . "" Has anything happened ? "" "" No. How very easily alarmed you are ! "" he answered , removing his cloak and hanging it up against the door , towards which he again coolly pushed the mat which his entrance had deranged . He stamped the snow from his boots . "" I shall sully the purity of your floor , "" said he , "" but you must excuse me for once . "" Then he approached the fire . "" I have had hard work to get here , I assure you , "" he observed , as he warmed his hands over the flame . "" One drift took me up to the waist ; happily the snow is quite soft yet . "" "" But why are you come ? "" I could not forbear saying . "" Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor ; but since you ask it , I answer simply to have a little talk with you ; I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms . Besides , since yesterday I have experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told , and who is impatient to hear the sequel . "" He sat down . I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday , and really I began to fear his wits were touched . If he were insane , however , his was a very cool and collected insanity : I had never seen that handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did just now , as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale , where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved . I waited , expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend ; but his hand was now at his chin , his finger on his lip : he was thinking . It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face . A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart : I was moved to say -- "" I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you : it is too bad that you should be quite alone ; and you are recklessly rash about your own health . "" "" Not at all , "" said he : "" I care for myself when necessary . I am well now . What do you see amiss in me ? "" This was said with a careless , abstracted indifference , which showed that my solicitude was , at least in his opinion , wholly superfluous . I was silenced . He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip , and still his eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate ; thinking it urgent to say something , I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door , which was behind him . "" No , no ! "" he responded shortly and somewhat testily . "" Well , "" I reflected , "" if you wo n ' t talk , you may be still ; I 'll let you alone now , and return to my book . "" So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "" Marmion . "" He soon stirred ; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements ; he only took out a morocco pocket-book , thence produced a letter , which he read in silence , folded it , put it back , relapsed into meditation . It was vain to try to read with such an inscrutable fixture before me ; nor could I , in impatience , consent to be dumb ; he might rebuff me if he liked , but talk I would . "" Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately ? "" "" Not since the letter I showed you a week ago . "" "" There has not been any change made about your own arrangements ? You will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected ? "" "" I fear not , indeed : such chance is too good to befall me . "" Baffled so far , I changed my ground . I bethought myself to talk about the school and my scholars . "" Mary Garrett's mother is better , and Mary came back to the school this morning , and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow . "" "" Indeed ! "" "" Mr. Oliver pays for two . "" "" Does he ? "" "" He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas . "" "" I know . "" "" Was it your suggestion ? "" "" No. "" "" Whose , then ? "" "" His daughter 's , I think . "" "" It is like her : she is so good-natured . "" "" Yes . "" Again came the blank of a pause : the clock struck eight strokes . It aroused him ; he uncrossed his legs , sat erect , turned to me . "" Leave your book a moment , and come a little nearer the fire , "" he said . Wondering , and of my wonder finding no end , I complied . "" Half-an-hour ago , "" he pursued , "" I spoke of my impatience to hear the sequel of a tale : on reflection , I find the matter will be better managed by my assuming the narrator's part , and converting you into a listener . Before commencing , it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears ; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips . For the rest , whether trite or novel , it is short . "" Twenty years ago , a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell in love with a rich man's daughter ; she fell in love with him , and married him , against the advice of all her friends , who consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding . Before two years passed , the rash pair were both dead , and laid quietly side by side under one slab . ( I have seen their grave ; it formed part of the pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim , soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in --- shire . ) They left a daughter , which , at its very birth , Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night . Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations ; it was reared by an aunt-in - law , called ( I come to names now ) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead . You start--did you hear a noise ? I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom : it was a barn before I had it repaired and altered , and barns are generally haunted by rats . -- To proceed . Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years : whether it was happy or not with her , I can not say , never having been told ; but at the end of that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than Lowood School , where you so long resided yourself . It seems her career there was very honourable : from a pupil , she became a teacher , like yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and yours--she left it to be a governess : there , again , your fates were analogous ; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester . "" "" Mr. Rivers ! "" I interrupted . "" I can guess your feelings , "" he said , "" but restrain them for a while : I have nearly finished ; hear me to the end . Of Mr. Rochester's character I know nothing , but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl , and that at the very altar she discovered he had a wife yet alive , though a lunatic . What his subsequent conduct and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture ; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary , it was discovered she was gone--no one could tell when , where , or how . She had left Thornfield Hall in the night ; every research after her course had been vain : the country had been scoured far and wide ; no vestige of information could be gathered respecting her . Yet that she should be found is become a matter of serious urgency : advertisements have been put in all the papers ; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs , a solicitor , communicating the details I have just imparted . Is it not an odd tale ? "" "" Just tell me this , "" said I , "" and since you know so much , you surely can tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester ? How and where is he ? What is he doing ? Is he well ? "" "" I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester : the letter never mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to . You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event which requires her appearance . "" "" Did no one go to Thornfield Hall , then ? Did no one see Mr. Rochester ? "" "" I suppose not . "" "" But they wrote to him ? "" "" Of course . "" "" And what did he say ? Who has his letters ? "" "" Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr. Rochester , but from a lady : it is signed ' Alice Fairfax . ' "" I felt cold and dismayed : my worst fears then were probably true : he had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to some former haunt on the Continent . And what opiate for his severe sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there ? I dared not answer the question . Oh , my poor master--once almost my husband--whom I had often called "" my dear Edward ! "" "" He must have been a bad man , "" observed Mr. Rivers . "" You do n't know him--do n't pronounce an opinion upon him , "" I said , with warmth . "" Very well , "" he answered quietly : "" and indeed my head is otherwise occupied than with him : I have my tale to finish . Since you wo n ' t ask the governess's name , I must tell it of my own accord . Stay ! I have it here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written down , fairly committed to black and white . "" And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced , opened , sought through ; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper , hastily torn off : I recognised in its texture and its stains of ultra-marine , and lake , and vermillion , the ravished margin of the portrait-cover . He got up , held it close to my eyes : and I read , traced in Indian ink , in my own handwriting , the words "" JANE EYRE "" -- the work doubtless of some moment of abstraction . "" Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre : "" he said , "" the advertisements demanded a Jane Eyre : I knew a Jane Elliott . -- I confess I had my suspicions , but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once resolved into certainty . You own the name and renounce the _alias_ ? "" "" Yes--yes ; but where is Mr. Briggs ? He perhaps knows more of Mr. Rochester than you do . "" "" Briggs is in London . I should doubt his knowing anything at all about Mr. Rochester ; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested . Meantime , you forget essential points in pursuing trifles : you do not inquire why Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you . "" "" Well , what did he want ? "" "" Merely to tell you that your uncle , Mr. Eyre of Madeira , is dead ; that he has left you all his property , and that you are now rich--merely that--nothing more . "" "" I ! -- rich ? "" "" Yes , you , rich--quite an heiress . "" Silence succeeded . "" You must prove your identity of course , "" resumed St. John presently : "" a step which will offer no difficulties ; you can then enter on immediate possession . Your fortune is vested in the English funds ; Briggs has the will and the necessary documents . "" Here was a new card turned up ! It is a fine thing , reader , to be lifted in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing ; but not a matter one can comprehend , or consequently enjoy , all at once . And then there are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving : _this_ is solid , an affair of the actual world , nothing ideal about it : all its associations are solid and sober , and its manifestations are the same . One does not jump , and spring , and shout hurrah ! at hearing one has got a fortune ; one begins to consider responsibilities , and to ponder business ; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares , and we contain ourselves , and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow . Besides , the words Legacy , Bequest , go side by side with the words , Death , Funeral . My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative ; ever since being made aware of his existence , I had cherished the hope of one day seeing him : now , I never should . And then this money came only to me : not to me and a rejoicing family , but to my isolated self . It was a grand boon doubtless ; and independence would be glorious--yes , I felt that--that thought swelled my heart . "" You unbend your forehead at last , "" said Mr. Rivers . "" I thought Medusa had looked at you , and that you were turning to stone . Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth ? "" "" How much am I worth ? "" "" Oh , a trifle ! Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds , I think they say--but what is that ? "" "" Twenty thousand pounds ? "" Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand . This news actually took my breath for a moment : Mr. St. John , whom I had never heard laugh before , laughed now . "" Well , "" said he , "" if you had committed a murder , and I had told you your crime was discovered , you could scarcely look more aghast . "" "" It is a large sum--do n't you think there is a mistake ? "" "" No mistake at all . "" "" Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand ! "" "" It is written in letters , not figures , -- twenty thousand . "" I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for a hundred . Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on . "" If it were not such a very wild night , "" he said , "" I would send Hannah down to keep you company : you look too desperately miserable to be left alone . But Hannah , poor woman ! could not stride the drifts so well as I : her legs are not quite so long : so I must e ' en leave you to your sorrows . Good-night . "" He was lifting the latch : a sudden thought occurred to me . "" Stop one minute ! "" I cried . "" Well ? "" "" It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me ; or how he knew you , or could fancy that you , living in such an out-of-the-way place , had the power to aid in my discovery . "" "" Oh ! I am a clergyman , "" he said ; "" and the clergy are often appealed to about odd matters . "" Again the latch rattled . "" No ; that does not satisfy me ! "" I exclaimed : and indeed there was something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which , instead of allaying , piqued my curiosity more than ever . "" It is a very strange piece of business , "" I added ; "" I must know more about it . "" "" Another time . "" "" No ; to-night ! -- to-night ! "" and as he turned from the door , I placed myself between it and him . He looked rather embarrassed . "" You certainly shall not go till you have told me all , "" I said . "" I would rather not just now . "" "" You shall ! -- you must ! "" "" I would rather Diana or Mary informed you . "" Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax : gratified it must be , and that without delay ; and I told him so . "" But I apprised you that I was a hard man , "" said he , "" difficult to persuade . "" "" And I am a hard woman , -- impossible to put off . "" "" And then , "" he pursued , "" I am cold : no fervour infects me . "" "" Whereas I am hot , and fire dissolves ice . The blaze there has thawed all the snow from your cloak ; by the same token , it has streamed on to my floor , and made it like a trampled street . As you hope ever to be forgiven , Mr. Rivers , the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen , tell me what I wish to know . "" "" Well , then , "" he said , "" I yield ; if not to your earnestness , to your perseverance : as stone is worn by continual dropping . Besides , you must know some day , -- as well now as later . Your name is Jane Eyre ? "" "" Of course : that was all settled before . "" "" You are not , perhaps , aware that I am your namesake ? -- that I was christened St. John Eyre Rivers ? "" "" No , indeed ! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your initials written in books you have at different times lent me ; but I never asked for what name it stood . But what then ? Surely -- "" I stopped : I could not trust myself to entertain , much less to express , the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself , -- that , in a second , stood out a strong , solid probability . Circumstances knit themselves , fitted themselves , shot into order : the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight , -- every ring was perfect , the connection complete . I knew , by instinct , how the matter stood , before St. John had said another word ; but I can not expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception , so I must repeat his explanation . "" My mother's name was Eyre ; she had two brothers ; one a clergyman , who married Miss Jane Reed , of Gateshead ; the other , John Eyre , Esq. , merchant , late of Funchal , Madeira . Mr. Briggs , being Mr. Eyre's solicitor , wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death , and to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's orphan daughter , overlooking us , in consequence of a quarrel , never forgiven , between him and my father . He wrote again a few weeks since , to intimate that the heiress was lost , and asking if we knew anything of her . A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find her out . You know the rest . "" Again he was going , but I set my back against the door . "" Do let me speak , "" I said ; "" let me have one moment to draw breath and reflect . "" I paused--he stood before me , hat in hand , looking composed enough . I resumed -- "" Your mother was my father's sister ? "" "" Yes . "" "" My aunt , consequently ? "" He bowed . "" My uncle John was your uncle John ? You , Diana , and Mary are his sister's children , as I am his brother's child ? "" "" Undeniably . "" "" You three , then , are my cousins ; half our blood on each side flows from the same source ? "" "" We are cousins ; yes . "" I surveyed him . It seemed I had found a brother : one I could be proud of , -- one I could love ; and two sisters , whose qualities were such , that , when I knew them but as mere strangers , they had inspired me with genuine affection and admiration . The two girls , on whom , kneeling down on the wet ground , and looking through the low , latticed window of Moor House kitchen , I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair , were my near kinswomen ; and the young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation . Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch ! This was wealth indeed ! -- wealth to the heart ! -- a mine of pure , genial affections . This was a blessing , bright , vivid , and exhilarating ; -- not like the ponderous gift of gold : rich and welcome enough in its way , but sobering from its weight . I now clapped my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded , my veins thrilled . "" Oh , I am glad ! -- I am glad ! "" I exclaimed . St. John smiled . "" Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue trifles ? "" he asked . "" You were serious when I told you you had got a fortune ; and now , for a matter of no moment , you are excited . "" "" What can you mean ? It may be of no moment to you ; you have sisters and do n't care for a cousin ; but I had nobody ; and now three relations , -- or two , if you do n't choose to be counted , -- are born into my world full-grown . I say again , I am glad ! "" I walked fast through the room : I stopped , half suffocated with the thoughts that rose faster than I could receive , comprehend , settle them : -- thoughts of what might , could , would , and should be , and that ere long . I looked at the blank wall : it seemed a sky thick with ascending stars , -- every one lit me to a purpose or delight . Those who had saved my life , whom , till this hour , I had loved barrenly , I could now benefit . They were under a yoke , -- I could free them : they were scattered , -- I could reunite them : the independence , the affluence which was mine , might be theirs too . Were we not four ? Twenty thousand pounds shared equally would be five thousand each , justice--enough and to spare : justice would be done , -- mutual happiness secured . Now the wealth did not weigh on me : now it was not a mere bequest of coin , -- it was a legacy of life , hope , enjoyment . How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm , I can not tell ; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me , and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it . He also advised me to be composed ; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and distraction , shook off his hand , and began to walk about again . "" Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow , "" I said , "" and tell them to come home directly . Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a thousand pounds , so with five thousand they will do very well . "" "" Tell me where I can get you a glass of water , "" said St. John ; "" you must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings . "" "" Nonsense ! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you ? Will it keep you in England , induce you to marry Miss Oliver , and settle down like an ordinary mortal ? "" "" You wander : your head becomes confused . I have been too abrupt in communicating the news ; it has excited you beyond your strength . "" "" Mr. Rivers ! you quite put me out of patience : I am rational enough ; it is you who misunderstand , or rather who affect to misunderstand . "" "" Perhaps , if you explained yourself a little more fully , I should comprehend better . "" "" Explain ! What is there to explain ? You can not fail to see that twenty thousand pounds , the sum in question , divided equally between the nephew and three nieces of our uncle , will give five thousand to each ? What I want is , that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the fortune that has accrued to them . "" "" To you , you mean . "" "" I have intimated my view of the case : I am incapable of taking any other . I am not brutally selfish , blindly unjust , or fiendishly ungrateful . Besides , I am resolved I will have a home and connections . I like Moor House , and I will live at Moor House ; I like Diana and Mary , and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary . It would please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds ; it would torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand ; which , moreover , could never be mine in justice , though it might in law . I abandon to you , then , what is absolutely superfluous to me . Let there be no opposition , and no discussion about it ; let us agree amongst each other , and decide the point at once . "" "" This is acting on first impulses ; you must take days to consider such a matter , ere your word can be regarded as valid . "" "" Oh ! if all you doubt is my sincerity , I am easy : you see the justice of the case ? "" "" I _do_ see a certain justice ; but it is contrary to all custom . Besides , the entire fortune is your right : my uncle gained it by his own efforts ; he was free to leave it to whom he would : he left it to you . After all , justice permits you to keep it : you may , with a clear conscience , consider it absolutely your own . "" "" With me , "" said I , "" it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of conscience : I must indulge my feelings ; I so seldom have had an opportunity of doing so . Were you to argue , object , and annoy me for a year , I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a glimpse--that of repaying , in part , a mighty obligation , and winning to myself lifelong friends . "" "" You think so now , "" rejoined St. John , "" because you do not know what it is to possess , nor consequently to enjoy wealth : you can not form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you ; of the place it would enable you to take in society ; of the prospects it would open to you : you can not -- "" "" And you , "" I interrupted , "" can not at all imagine the craving I have for fraternal and sisterly love . I never had a home , I never had brothers or sisters ; I must and will have them now : you are not reluctant to admit me and own me , are you ? "" "" Jane , I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights . "" "" Brother ? Yes ; at the distance of a thousand leagues ! Sisters ? Yes ; slaving amongst strangers ! I , wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned and do not merit ! You , penniless ! Famous equality and fraternisation ! Close union ! Intimate attachment ! "" "" But , Jane , your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate : you may marry . "" "" Nonsense , again ! Marry ! I do n't want to marry , and never shall marry . "" "" That is saying too much : such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the excitement under which you labour . "" "" It is not saying too much : I know what I feel , and how averse are my inclinations to the bare thought of marriage . No one would take me for love ; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money speculation . And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising , alien , different from me ; I want my kindred : those with whom I have full fellow - feeling . Say again you will be my brother : when you uttered the words I was satisfied , happy ; repeat them , if you can , repeat them sincerely . "" "" I think I can . I know I have always loved my own sisters ; and I know on what my affection for them is grounded , -- respect for their worth and admiration of their talents . You too have principle and mind : your tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's ; your presence is always agreeable to me ; in your conversation I have already for some time found a salutary solace . I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my heart for you , as my third and youngest sister . "" "" Thank you : that contents me for to-night . Now you had better go ; for if you stay longer , you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful scruple . "" "" And the school , Miss Eyre ? It must now be shut up , I suppose ? "" "" No. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute . "" He smiled approbation : we shook hands , and he took leave . I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had , and arguments I used , to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished . My task was a very hard one ; but , as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the equity of the intention ; and must , besides , have been innately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration . The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer : both coincided in my opinion : I carried my point . The instruments of transfer were drawn out : St. John , Diana , Mary , and I , each became possessed of a competency ."	6
985	Influential midfielder Steve Sidwell faces a two game ban after picking up his tenth yelow card of the season . Steve Sidwell will be forced to watch from the stands when Reading take on league leaders Ipswich Town at the Madejski Stadium next weekend . The 22-year-old , who became the club's youngest ever captain last month , faces a two-game spell on the sidelines after picking up his tenth yellow card of the season away at Burnley this afternoon . Gritty midfielder Sidwell has been a consistent performer in the centre of the park this season so will be sorely missed . The former Brighton and Brentford loanee will also miss our league game against Plymouth Argyle in early February or , if we win our Third Round replay , our FA Cup Fourth Round fixture against either Leicester or Blackpool But top of the Championship Ipswich will prove tough opponents for Reading next weekend so Harper and Hughes , who are likely to fill the two central midfield spots , will have to be at their best if the Royals are to pick up three precious points . It is thought that American winger Bobby Convey will retain his place in the team for the game against the league leaders having put in some impressive performances in his last two outings . Veteran frontman Les Ferdinand could be back from injury in time for next weekend's big game , although he will miss out on playing in Monday night's cup replay at Swansea .	8
1335	"Form PF is the documentation used by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators to understand the financial health of a hedge fund and the effects its potential collapse might have on the overall economy . The largest private fund managers were required to submit the form as of late August following their registration with the SEC mandated under the U.S. financial reform legislation . The largest alternative fund managers are required to update the information quarterly and have a lot more sections on the document to fill out than the smallest fund managers which must only provide the basics on annual updates . Kaal , who teaches international finance , did not ask hedge fund managers specifically about their responses to Form PF so he offered no hard core numbers to back his stance . The information , he tells www.iss-mag.com was provided during discussions with attendees of conferences where the paper was presented . "" No one wanted to clarify just what the phrase flatten out meant , "" explains Kaal . "" It was the exact wording they used in discussing how they responded to PF which suggests that they took advantage of the SEC allowing them some leeway in how they would answer some of the questions . "" A random survey of about a dozen hedge fund compliance executives conducted by www.iss-mag.com on Wednesday also provided little insight into how US hedge funds might have presented information on Form PF . None wanted to publicly elaborate , but privately gave credence to Kaal's "" anecdotal evidence , "" saying they "" hedged "" their answers when necessary to provide as little information as possible which would expose their trading strategies to competitors if it fell in the wrong hands . Risk metrics -- counterparty , value at risk and liquidity risk were also key areas where the questions were subject to interpretation . The "" anecdotal "" evidence begs the question as to whether Form PF will actually provide U.S. regulators -- the SEC and newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council--with any sense of systemic risk , one of the key reasons the documentation was mandated in the first place . Many hedge fund advisers have doubted its long-term efficacy , viewing competing the form as a tedious compliance exercise . The consensus of the 94 advisers to hedge funds , private equity funds , venture capital funds and real-estate funds who responded to Kaal's questionnaire indicated that complying with Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act was a bit surprising . Although the majority of respondents say they outsourced compliance work , hired additional counsel and staff ; instituted new recordkeeping policies ; changed marketing materials ; and changed communications with investors , the pricetag and time spent complying with the legislation reflected Kaal's conclusion that it had only a "" moderate "" impact . Most of the respondents said they spent about $ 50 , 000 to $ 200 , 000 and did less than 500 hours worth of work . Still , Kaal does offer one key caveat to his study . It is entitled "" Hedge Fund Manager Registration Under the Dodd-Frank Act ; An Empirical Study , "" but as Kaal notes , the results are "" preliminary . "" He will be conducting further studies on the effects of Dodd-Frank on alternative funds , with an emphasis on smaller-sized funds . More often than not , their advisers cited cost as a challenge to complying with the new regulations . Regulations and Compliance"	8

735	"The National Biodiversity Network ( NBN ) is home to all information on the nation's biodiversity . You can find the Local Biodiversity Action Plan ( LBAP ) for your area from www.biodiversityscotland.org or www.searchnbn.net The involvement of the people of Scotland is essential if we are to conserve biodiversity for today and the future . Across Scotland , people are taking action for biodiversity in their own ' back yard ' . Local Biodiversity Action Plan partnerships have been set up , involving government agencies , national and local voluntary bodies and community groups all working together . Local wildlife sites are being managed , greenspace networks established and gardens made more wildlife friendly . Public bodies are looking to include action for biodiversity in their everyday activities . Wherever you live in Scotland , there are opportunities to get involved in biodiversity conservation locally . Twenty-four Local Biodiversity Action Plans ( LBAPs ) cover the country from Shetland in the north to Galloway in the south and from the Western Isles / Na h-Eileanan Siar in the west to Aberdeen in the east . Each LBAP is overseen by a partnership of national and local organisations , some of which also contribute funding to the project . In most cases core funding is provided by SNH and the Local Authority , with a variety of other organisations contributing in different circumstances . One or more LBAP Officers may be employed ( usually by one of the partner organisations - most often the Local Authority ) to promote and co-ordinate activities . In some areas , the additional post is a Community Biodiversity Officer , with a specific remit to encourage community involvement in the LBAP . The work of LBAPs contributes in many ways to fulfilling the objectives of the Scottish Biodiversity Strategy , particularly in terms : of halting the loss of biodversity and bringing about the recovery of threatened habitats and species ; increasing people's awareness , enjoyment and understanding of biodiversity and getting more people involved in its conservation ; integrating and co-ordinating consideration of biodiversity into all decision making ; and ensuring that the most up-to-date knowledge of biodiversity is available to decision-makers . Local Authorities have a duty to achieve "" best value "" in delivering the services which they provide , Guidance on "" Best Value and Biodiversity in Scotland "" is available via the Scottish Executive website . In addition , all public bodies have a duty under the Nature Conservation ( Scotland ) Act to further the conservation of biodiversity in carrying out their functions . An important function of LBAPs is to raise people's awareness of their local biodiversity and what they can do to help . This applies to all sectors of society , and LBAPs may work with schools , youth groups , ethnic minorities , special-interest groups , businesses - in fact , anybody at all ! This type of work can include arts projects , story telling , production of leaflets , websites or CDs , and a whole range of activities several steps removed from hands-on habitat or species management . Greenspace Scotland Eco-schools Biodiversity Stories Business & biodiversity project So what do LBAPs actually do ? Most have by now completed the initial stage of drafting their own Local Biodiversity Action Plan . The Plan includes an assessment of which species and habitats are of particular importance in the local area . These will include species or habitats on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority list which occur locally , and also species and habitats considered important by local people . The Plan then sets out what needs to be done , and by whom , to improve the status of the chosen species and habitats . Some LBAPs may take on the function of identifying local sites of importance for biodiversity , which can then be taken into account by the authorities in decision-making . Information on species distribution can be obtained from the National Biodiversity Network Gateway however , this is not comprehensive . The umbrella organisation BRISC ( Biological Recording in Scotland ) is working to improve the availability of data on the distribution of Scottish habitats and species through projects such as "" Wildlife Counts "" . In some areas Local Biodiversity Records Centres hold this information at a local level . Links to these Centres can be obtained from the BRISC website . After deciding what needs to be done to improve the status of local biodiversity , resources must be found to do it . This may mean money , manpower or specialist expertise . Funding for project implementation can be sought from SNH under our "" Supporting Biodiversity "" or "" Involving People "" grant schemes , from locally-applicable European funds ( e.g. Leader + ) , Landfill Tax Credit Schemes , Lottery funds , charitable trusts and a variety of other sources , including of course the LBAP partner organisations . Lottery funding is also currently available through the BBC Breathing Places campaign .

220	"Agenda items 20 and 46 Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the United Nations , including special economic assistance The situation in Afghanistan and its implications for international peace and security Identical letters dated 23 January 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Afghanistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council I have the honour to forward herewith the text of a letter dated 23 January 2001 from A. Abdullah , Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Islamic State of Afghanistan , addressed to you ( see annex ) . I should be grateful if you would have the text of the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly and of the Security Council . ( Signed ) Dr. Ravan Farhâdi Ambassador Permanent Representative Annex to the identical letters dated 23 January 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Afghanistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council Following the convening of the meeting in Akora Khattak , Pakistan , on 10 January 2001 of the Pakistan-based extremist groups , advocating maximized military support of Pakistan to the Taliban-Osama coalition , and defying the United Nations sanctions against the militia , the Pakistan military junta has brought in new military force in northern Afghanistan . Reports gathered recently by the security services of the Islamic State of Afghanistan indicate that since 12 January 2001 , a number of new commando and artillery units of the Pakistan Army have been deployed in northern Afghanistan , in preparation for foreseeable attacks on the government forces . According to the reports , in a sweeping move , preceding the deadline of the imposition of the new United Nations sanctions against the Taliban mercenaries , Pakistan army officers and units have recently been posted to Afghanistan as follows : General Qamar-u-Zaman of the Pakistan Army has been assigned as the new officer in charge of military operations in Afghanistan , replacing Pakistan's General of the Army Saeed Zafar , who functioned in the same capacity in Afghanistan over the past year ; General Tariq Bashir , formerly commander of the Ninth Commando Division of the Pakistan Army ; Brigadier Momin of the Kohat Division of the Pakistan Army ; Colonel Sanaullah of the Kohat Division of the Pakistan Army ; Colonel Hamza of Pakistan's military intelligence services ( ISI ) ; The 998 Brigade has been replaced by the 996 Brigade of Charat Commando Divisions , under Brigadier Amjad of Sayawali , Pakistan ; The 117 Brigade has been replaced by the 994 Brigade , under Faizan Khan of Laki Maroot , Pakistan ; The 625 Artillery Battalion has been newly deployed in the northern Kunduz province , under ranking officer Rafique of the Pakistan Army ; Brigadier Amjad has been assigned as the commanding officer of Pakistan attacking forces in the northern Takhar province . The Pakistan Army units operating under Brigadier Amjad are reported to have been especially equipped with infrastructure capability to cross the Kokcha River , where the government forces are entrenched ; The 998 Brigade has been withdrawn from the fronts , and designated as the Reserve Corps , to take over the ongoing routine military training in preparation for future deployments across Afghanistan ; The total additional number of armed Pakistan nationals , recently dispatched to northern Afghanistan , is estimated at about 1,500 . According to the reports , Pakistan forces have joined scores of heavily armed militants from the Osama bin Laden Al-Qaeda terrorist network and a sizeable number of Taliban mercenaries , already poised to attack territories across the Kokcha River on the border of Badakhshan province in the north-east . An attack by the Pakistan-Taliban-Osama forces on 12 January , targeting Khoja-Ghar , Dasht-e-Qala and Ay Khanum along the same area was beaten back fiercely by the government troops , with as many as 200 Taliban dead and heavy material losses . The convening of the Akora Khattak meeting in broad daylight by as many as 30 militant groups , protected by hundreds of heavily armed guards of their own , while martial law imposed by the military Government of Pakistan remains in effect throughout the country , among other things , serves as ample proof that the gathering was orchestrated by the Government of Pakistan aimed at intensifying and prolonging the war in Afghanistan and yet misleading the international community . The gathering , attended by top-ranking officers of the Pakistan ISI , such as General ( retired ) Hamid Gul , former Chief of military intelligence services and General Aslam Beg of the Pakistan Army , starkly unravels Pakistan's un-Islamic exploitation of religion for its unholy military and political hegemonic purposes , while bringing to light the treacherous and bogus preaching of the Pakistan political and military establishment concerning the "" negative impacts of the United Nations sanctions on the civilian population of Afghanistan "" . The current surge in Pakistan military involvement in Afghanistan clearly manifests Pakistan's belligerence against the Security Council resolution , that , inter alia , calls for an embargo on provision of arms and military aid to the Taliban , immediate withdrawal of foreign military personnel from Afghanistan and closure of all terrorist training camps inside Afghanistan .

1641	When describing the motion of objects in terms of distance , time , and direction , physicists use the basic quantities of speed and velocity . Two terms , two distinct meanings . Yet , not uncommonly , we hear these terms used interchangeably . So , what 's the difference ? Why is it incorrect to use the terms speed and velocity interchangeably ? The reason is simple . Speed is the time rate at which an object is moving along a path , while velocity is the rate and direction of an object's movement . Put another way , speed is a scalar value , while velocity is a vector . For example , 50 km / hr ( 31 mph ) describes the speed at which a car is traveling along a road , while 50 km / hr west describes the velocity at which it is traveling . The mathematical calculation for speed is relatively straightforward , wherein the average speed of an object is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time it took the object to travel the distance . Velocity , on the other hand , is more complicated mathematically and can be calculated in different ways , depending on what information is available about the object's motion . In its simplest form , average velocity is calculated by dividing change in position ( Δr ) by change in time ( Δt ) .	4
982	"As Japan , the United States and South Korea meet in Tokyo to discuss setting up a second round of international talks on halting North Korea's nuclear weapons development , Pyongyang warns that it is already taking steps to increase it nuclear capabilities . North Korea is once again saying that it has no interest in further rounds of six-party talks on its nuclear program , echoing comments made following the first such round , which was held in Beijing in August and ended without concrete progress . The north also says it is boosting its nuclear capabilities as a deterrent against a possible attack by the United States . For weeks , Pyongyang , through its Korean Central News Agency , has threatened to beef up nuclear weapons development to ward off a possible U.S. strike . A spokesman of the North Korean Foreign Ministry said that if Washington pushed the north to give up its nuclear weapons program before guaranteeing the isolated Stalinist state's security , it could lead to war . The South Korean and American governments see such comments as a typical North Korean negotiating tactic . Pyongyang also called again for a non-aggression treaty from the United States before it responds to international concerns about its nuclear program , a request Washington has repeatedly rejected . The United States insists the north must scrap its weapons programs first , but has also said it has no plans to attack it . The north's latest commentary comes as the Bush administration's top negotiator on North Korea , Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly , met for a second day with officials from Japan and South Korea in Tokyo to discuss preparations for a new round of six-country talks involving China , Russia , the two Koreas , Japan and the United States . James Kelly "" > James Kelly The talks were held behind closed doors at a Tokyo hotel and officials did not comment on the meeting's content . Noriyuki Suzuki , a Japan-based North Korea expert , says he has high hopes for the six-party process and noted that all participants agreed to work on solving the conflict peacefully . He added that he is confident that the negotiation process will eventually halt North Korea's nuclear activities . Also Tuesday , the United States and South Korea commemorated the 50th anniversary of their Mutual Defense Treaty , under which Washington stations 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea to help protect it in case the North launches an attack . The American ambassador to South Korea , Thomas Hubbard , said in a speech in Seoul on Tuesday that the United States and South Korea must continue to be vigilant in the face of the North Korean security threat . The nuclear crisis erupted nearly one year ago when the United States accused North Korea of the reneging on a 1994 agreement by running a secret nuclear weapons program ."	8

736	Upper-class reformers These people feared that without change there might be a revolution . Middle-class reformers Many middle-class people were quite wealthy – factory owners , etc – but still did not qualify for the vote . The banker Thomas Attwood founded the Birmingham Political Union in 1829 . The purpose was to campaign for change . In 1832 it had 25,000 members . Most wanted the vote for other middle-class people – not necessarily the poor . Working-class reformers Some political unions wanted the vote for all men . Many working-class people realised to get change – say the better working conditions , they needed Parliaments help . Parliament did not represent their concerns . So to get change they needed to change Parliament . To do that they needed the vote .	0
339	"Luxury living is child's play The great thing about the Azia Beach Hotel in Cyprus is that it 's five-star but not formal . So take the baby and relax , says Lena Corner Published : 23 July 2006 It 's often easier to stay at home than drag a child of an awkward age away on holiday . Fifteen-month-old Ronnie is at that in-between stage where he 's just learnt to walk and is terribly excited by his new skill but also frighteningly unsteady . A younger baby is more portable because it will sit in its pram and a toddler you can leave to run off steam . Ronnie does n ' t quite do either . So when our taxi finally swept into the forecourt of the Azia Beach Hotel and Spa , after a fairly fraught four-hour flight , the relief was immense . We checked into our room and popped Ronnie in his cot just in time to crack open a couple of ice-cold Keo beers and catch a blistering red sunset over the Mediterranean from the comfort of the hot tub on our balcony . The great thing about the Azia is that it does five-star without being formal or turgid . Its brochure is emblazoned with that old "" barefoot glamour "" cliché , but here it really works . This is the kind of place where a noisy baby at the dinner table gets serenaded by a musician rather than banished to its room . Although it 's a fairly average resort set-up , with a pool complex at the centre , a couple of restaurants , gym , tennis courts etc , last year a facelift - the addition of a luxurious Elemis spa along with plenty of muted earthy tones and contemporary styling - shifted it up-market . Ronnie made himself at home immediately . In the mornings he ate under a canopy of trees in the outdoor restaurant , before taking to the shallowest waters of the pool . When the sun got too high he checked into the kids' club where Sophie and any other passing Azia staff drooled all over him as he tried to play . After a long siesta he would go for a leisurely jaunt to the nearby beach and in the evening a selection of jolly Russian baby sitters could be called upon to sing him to sleep . This left plenty of time for us to laze by the pool , or , in the evening , catch a taxi into Paphos ( a 10-minute drive away ) , where we indulged in , or rather gorged on , a 30-course fish mezze . The spa facilities were also put to good use - and it 's not just a couple of treatment rooms masquerading as a spa , it really is the full works ( voted by Grazia magazine as one of the world's 10 best new spas ) . In the adjoining yoga centre I had one of the most vigorous yoga sessions I 've ever had . Fifteen years ago , all this was nothing but a patchwork of fields covered mainly with banana trees . Antis Economides , the owner , had the foresight to buy one . Then , when he had raised a bit more money , he bought another , until he had five on which the Azia now stands . The only drawback , if it is one , is that we were so firmly ensconced in the comfort of the Azia that our sense of wanderlust was completely dampened . The west coast of Cyprus does not have the big sandy beaches of the other side ; instead it has rocks and plenty of tiny , sandy coves . One hot morning , feeling unusually energetic , we caught the number 10 bus to Coral Bay . Lovely for an hour or so , but trying to pin a hot , sticky child down to the prickly seat on the way back was n ' t relaxing . The more adventurous could hire a Jeep and head on a little further to Cape Lara , a long sweep of unspoilt sand , and see where the green turtles come in to nest . Or , better still , get off the tourist trail and head inland to the villages at the foot of the magnificent Troodos Mountains . But , as soon as you venture out , there is the Brits-abroad reality check to contend with . Take the road along the coast either to the east or west and you will come across O ' Solomon's Irish bar , the Zik Zak club , Sid's pub and any number of other Identikit tourist traps trying to lure you in with offers of beer at knockdown prices . And , as for the number of property companies vying for foreign trade , it will be a wonder if there are any Cypriots left on the island in five years . Not that any of this bothers Economides . His passion is not so much in the business of running a hotel - he leaves that to his wife and two daughters - but in the workings of his beloved plantation just outside Paphos . There , he cultivates the incredible array of plant-life that covers the Azia's gardens and also grows around 80 per cent of the fruit used by the hotel - impressive , when you consider there are 250 rooms and 15 bungalows . So as well as the striking 50ft cerise bougainvillaea that grows up the stark white frontage of the Azia , there are palm trees of a type you will never have seen before and huge bushes of lavender , which gets used in the spa . And it is these luscious gardens , which slope down to the cliff edge , that sets the Azia apart from the rest . Economides really has created a luscious oasis in a hot , rocky corner of Cyprus . Even Ronnie , as he raced from the pool to the kids' club , stopped for a split second to show his appreciation for one of the more Jurassic-looking protuberances by beating it repeatedly with his plastic spade . Argo Holidays ( 0870 066 7070 ; argoholidays . c om ) is offering seven nights at the Azia Club & Spa , Paphos , in an inland room , from £ 895 per adult , based on two sharing , and £ 269 per child aged two to 12 years sharing their parents' room , including return flights from Gatwick , transfers and b & b"	2
1281	Why Care About Weatherproofing Your Footwear ? The leather of your shoe can usually withstand several thousands of flexes . However , when it encounters water , it loses its suppleness and this has an impact on the life of the shoe . Leather comes from animal skin and hence , comprises fat and proteins that retain a set amount of moisture after being tanned . The fibres that criss-cross each other in the corium give leather its unique strength . However , they are also prone to drying out and cracking if neglected . Thus , minimise rapid influxes , releases of moisture and exposure to acids or alkaline solutions . The last point is particularly worth emphasising as acids and alkaline solutions can damage the leather permanently . Additionally , salt and other harsh chemicals can leave stains on leather . Once they permeate the leather , they can be very difficult to remove . Thereafter , they will discolour and weaken the top layers of the shoe and eventually end up damaging the finish . The best remedy for this is a simple layer of wax polish that will act as the buffer between the leather and these harmful elements . How to Make Your Shoes Water Resistant Select a Waterproofing Compound Wax-based Polishes : Shoe pastes and creams only nourish the leather . Wax-based polishes create a shine and in doing so , create a thin protective layer that provides light resistance to water and salt . When availing of this option , ensure consistent application after every few wears or if the weather is hostile , after every wear . Specialty Waterproof Compounds : These compounds have a longer sticking period than polishes , when applied properly . Unlike polishes , these compounds seal out the moisture and can be used in conjunction with a polish , once the seal has been set . Spray-on Waterproofing Compounds : Water and stain protectors produced by many companies are safe for use on leather and suede . They usually dry up in 30 minutes and can be worn after the specified time is over . However , they should be used liberally as they lose their efficacy after a few wears . They merely form a protective coat on the leather and do not permeate it . Test and Prepare for Waterproofing For any shoe that is not black in colour , ensure that the compound chosen does not change the shoe's appearance . Do not be misled by the manufacturer's claims that the waterproofing compound does not alter the shoe's colour . Remove the laces of the shoe and clean the shoe thoroughly with a rag and a brush , rendering it free from dirt . Choose an area of the shoe that is not particularly exposed such as the shoe's tongue , under the laces . Apply a small amount of the compound and see how it reacts . If the reaction is satisfactory , apply the compound to another area like the inner back of the shoe . Apply the Water Resistant Compound Evenly and Ensure a Barrier is Formed The sole difference between a waterproof compound and a shining compound application is the attention you should pay to forming an unbroken seal . When shining your shoes , spot shining is an option . However , when waterproofing them , you need to ensure that a water tight barrier is formed if the process is to prove effective . Choose the Right Men's Footwear Beater Shoes : Some men wear shoes that they do n't care about when stepping out into adverse weather conditions . However , this does n't prove to be effective when they need to look professional . We recommend that you have the right equipment than have a pair of shoes , whose sole purpose is to be left to face the vagaries of the weather . Specialty Footwear : Solid footwear made of water-resistant materials such as gortex , synthetic leathers and non-slip rubber soles is commonly available nowadays . Their style design and durability make them practical favourites among men , even though they do not offer as much protection as galoshes . Boots : Boots can be used for a variety of purposes from hiking to work and are a great choice for dealing with inclement weather , since they protect the ankles and can reach up to knee-height as well . They can not be worn with a variety of outfits or men's suits and anything dressier than odd trousers would appear awkward . The dress boot has a wider range and can be worn with a tailor made men's suit ; however , it provides lesser protection than an actual pair of boots since it has a more delicate sole and a smaller heel . These can not traverse through puddles and hence , dress boots need to be treated as well as dress shoes . Boots , however , need to be regularly treated with waterproofing compounds depending on the wearer's environment and the frequency of use . Galoshes : These are rubber footwear that slip over shoes and protect them from the elements and include both over-shoes and over-boots . Since they encapsulate the feet completely , the feet remain dry . Additionally , they also provide excellent traction . The downsides to galoshes are that they need to fit properly and it can take some time to get used to the additional weight they bear . Measures to Take When Your Shoes Are Already Wet Pull the moisture from inside of the shoe using a small dry towel or even a newspaper . Draw the moisture out and replace the moist paper with dry paper , on an hourly basis . Let the shoes dry at room temperature rather than placing them near a source of heat . Heating them can cause the moisture to leave too quickly , thereby leading to the development of cracks on the leather . Cracks on leather can never be fixed . Once the shoes are dry and no further moisture is being drawn from within the shoe , clean and condition the shoe with a leather balm or cream and polish them normally .	7

304	"In 2000 , for the first time in over a decade - some say for the first time ever - world-wide sales of music compact disks ( CDs ) fell . The following year the decline continued . The sale of CD singles in the US , for example , dropped by almost 40 % in 2000 , the US experiencing a further 10 % fall in music sales in 2001 ( Harmon , 2002 ) . Indeed , only France and Britain have so far bucked this world-wide downward trend , in the latter's case , partly thanks to the huge success of artists such as Robbie Williams and Dido . But with recent reports suggesting that the value of UK music shipments dropped by 3.7 % last year to £ 1 . 2bn , even the previously buoyant British market now appears to be in decline ( Cassy , 2003 : 22 ) . All of which has left music industry chiefs frantically scrabbling for explanations . Among the most popular put forward to date are the slowing down of the world economy , the increase in popularity of CD ' rewriters ' , which enable individuals to make their own ' pirate ' CDs , and the fact that most people have by now long since replaced their old vinyl recordings of Phil Collins ' ' In the Air Tonight ' with a compact disk version . But there is another explanation , one with far more profound potential consequences for the music industry : the Napster effect . Napster is a software tool for sharing MP3 files . It was written in 1999 by a then nineteen-year-old student , Shawn Fanning , and named after his nick-name at school - he had short , very tight , curly hair . Specially designed for the Web , MP3 files allow users to make free digitised copies of their vinyl and CD collections to a very high standard of sound quality . Now to this extent MP3 merely represents a technological update on home cassette taping and the associated debates of the 1970s : MP3 is open standard , without copyright protection , and so makes it hard for music companies to prevent people from copying and distributing their products without paying for them first . The big difference between home taping and MP3 lies in the ease and scale with which the copied recordings can be shared . In marked contrast to cassettes , MP3 files can be transmitted from user to user over the internet , stored on their computer hard drives , and then played back either on their computers or MP3 players . Yet in the early days of MP3 this still was n ' t seen as being too much of a problem because , as with home taping , people tended to exchange these files mainly on an individual basis : among friends , work colleagues , etc. Until Napster , that is . Napster transformed the situation by organising the process of exchange , simultaneously increasing , vastly , the amount of recorded material available . It works likes this . When a person logs on to Napster , the software reads the hard-disk of their computer for music files , and adds them to its central directory . All anyone looking for free music then has to do is just search Napster's directory for the artists or songs they want and download them from there . Now I realise that when it comes to ' music piracy ' - or ' software communism ' , as some prefer to see it - Napster is a bit old hat these days . Sued for violation of copyright , Napster has long since been forced to remove all copyrighted files from its database . In late 2000 , in an attempt to reinvent itself as a legitimate business , Napster even signed a deal with Bertelsmann , one of the world's leading music and entertainment companies , to access their music catalogue , and subsequently proceeded to operate on a monthly subscription basis - although not particularly successfully , I might add . According to one report , for instance , whereas in ' the summer of 2000 , the peer-to-peer music company had more than 67m registered users swapping files free of charge - an internet phenomenon ' : Last [ May ] - until Bertelsmann , the German media group , stepped in - it was on the brink of bankruptcy . Bertelsmann has agreed to pay $ 8m ( £ 5 . 4m ) to see off Napster's creditors . Shawn Fanning , its founder , and Konrad Hilbers , CEO , are to stay on , having threatened to walk out . But it is far from certain that Napster will survive as a business . The online music provider is still being pursued by music companies seeking compensation . And its transition from a free service to a subscription model has caused users to desert in droves . ( Abrahams & Harding , 2002 ) And in fact at the time of writing Napster's site has indeed closed down . All of which has led to a whole series of arguments and disputes . Does Napster provide a model for revolutionising the music industry ? Witness the way in which , as Napster struggled through the courts , Gnutella , Kazaa and a range of other unauthorised free music download sites and file-sharing applications all took its place on the internet . 1 Or is Napster just another example of the general failure of new media technology to escape big business' power of incorporation for any significant length of time ? Indeed , does the recent announcement by HMV , the largest music retailer in Britain , that it is setting up its own website where , for £ 4.99 a month , subscribers can choose from almost 100,000 online tracks and download them as MP3 files direct onto their computers and portable MP3 players without ever having to set foot in a record shop , not provide evidence , if any was needed , that the free music download sites have had their day ? But let's hang fire with the usual debates around Napster for the moment and play a game of science-fiction instead . Let 's imagine that some time in the not too distant future it 's going to be possible to have an academic equivalent to Napster , Gnutella , Kazaa et al. . NapstarXivation As anyone who teaches or studies in a university ( and a British university especially ) will be only too aware , our current system of higher education is one in which an expansion of student numbers has gone hand in hand with a decline in the number of books and journals per student that are provided by university and college libraries . Severe cuts in funding , brought about by the attempts of successive governments to compete in the global marketplace by reducing the state budget deficit through decreases in public spending , not least on education , have produced a situation in which it is increasingly difficult for libraries to be able to afford to stock books , and for students to be able to buy them . ( To provide just one example from the US : whereas previously the University of California would have bought a copy of a particular book for each of its eight campus ' - UCLA , Berkeley , etc. - the University is now reported to be purchasing only one copy to share across all of them . ) And it 's not just teaching and learning that has been affected . Building a career , even just surviving as an academic , is today more than ever dependent on publications . But as both institutions and students have found it harder and harder to purchase texts , the traditional market for the academic monograph has been substantially eroded . This has led a number of academic publishers to cut back dramatically on their commissions , with many In Poland the censor says what you can and can not do , and that creates a hunger for what the censor refuses to pass , whether it 's any good or not . What is approved by the censor is often by definition of little real interest to the Polish public . In the West we have The Market . The Market censors us through our stomachs and through the pockets of would-be publishers . We can not do what we can not sell . If there is no market for a thing , a book say , then the chances are that it will not get written . And if someone should write it , that it will not get published , and if it is published that it will not sell . That is not to say that it is a bad book . ( Tighe , 2001 : 170 ) deciding to concentrate on producing ' Introductions ' and ' Readers ' for the relatively large first year undergraduate ' core course ' markets , and not produce books for second and third years , let alone postgraduate students , at all . Indeed , so bad has the situation become in the US that in May 2002 the Modern Language Association ( MLA ) produced an open letter calling for ' Action on Problems in Scholarly Book Publishing ' : . over the course of the last few decades , most departments of language and literature have come to demand that junior faculty members produce , as a condition for being seriously considered for promotion to tenure , a full-length scholarly book published by a reputable press . T he immediate problem , however , is that university presses , which in the past brought out the vast majority of scholarly books , are cutting back on the publication of works in some areas of language and literature . Indeed , we are told that certain presses have eliminated editorial positions in our disciplines .. Some junior faculty members who will be reviewed for tenure in this academic year . find themselves in a maddening double bind . They face a challenge--under inflexible time constraints and with very high stakes--that many of them may be unable to meet successfully , no matter how strong or serious their scholarly achievement , because academic presses simply can not afford to publish their books .. We are concerned because people who have spent years of professional training--our students , our colleagues--are at risk . Their careers are in jeopardy , and higher education stands to lose , or at least severely to damage , a generation of young scholars . ( Greenblatt , 2002 ) Of course , such problems have been offset to a degree by the seemingly endless stream of new journals that are being produced to meet the demand from academics for ever more ' research impact ' , Research Assessment Exercise ( RAE ) submitable publishing opportunities . The International Journal of Cultural Studies , The European Journal of Cultural Studies , Cultural Studies - Critical Methodologies , Journal of Visual Culture and Journal of Consumer Culture are just some of the new titles that have appeared in the cultural studies field from Sage alone . And yet a shortage of funds produced by decreasing budgets and the rapidly increasing costs of medical , scientific and technical journals has meant that many university libraries are unable to sustain their current holdings , never mind expand the number of periodicals they take . So even if academics do manage to get published in one of these organs , the chances of anyone having access to their work , let alone actually reading it , are getting slimmer all the time . ( As an academic one regularly hears rumours that the average readership for a journal article is , frighteningly enough , somewhere between just 3 and 7 readers . ) That the major high street book chains are increasingly reluctant to stock academic titles ( journals especially , but also books ) , and more and more independent books stores , such as Compendium and Silver Moon in London , are closing due to competition from the likes of Waterstones at one end of the market and Amazon . c om at the other , only exacerbates the situation . But , as I say , let 's play a game of science fiction and imagine for a moment what it would be like if it were possible to have an academic equivalent to Napster , Gnutella et al , something dealing with written texts rather than music ? What would the consequences be for the way in which scholarly research is conceived , acquired , communicated , exchanged , practised and understood ? Well , for one thing , a free academic text download ( and upload ) site of this kind would provide a way round some of the problems created by restrictive copyright regulations that have until recently enabled the publishing industry to severely limit the number of photocopied texts university lecturers in the UK can give to their students ( we 'll get to the legalities of all this in a moment ) . Academics could provide their classes with as many copies of books and journal articles as they like , simply by supplying students with the address where they can find them on the net and download them for free . By ' splicing and dicing ' from other texts , lecturers could even put their own ' Readers ' together in this way , and ensure that they are constructed to suit the exact requirements of their specific courses ( rather than having to rely on those huge ' doorstoppers ' that are produced by other people with their own courses in mind , and which never quite seem to do the job you want ) , while simultaneously meeting the demand for pre-packaged material created ' partly because of student poverty and partly because of the rise of the student as customer ' ( Midgley , 2002 : 15 ) . Perhaps most importantly of all , at least as far as those working in the humanities are concerned ( where , in contrast to the ' hard ' sciences , more importance is attached to writing academic monographs than to publishing in the most prestigious peer reviewed journals ) , academics and researchers would need no longer worry about whether their next research project was going to appeal to a publisher as something that could be marketed and sold . They could forget about this , secure in the knowledge that as soon as they finish slaving over their text it can be made readily available - to anyone , anywhere in the world ( providing of course that person has a computer and access to the Internet - not an insignificant point given that apparently one quarter of those in the UK and half of all Europeans do n't actually use the Net ) . And what 's more can stay that way for as long as they want ( so never again need As a minimum , access to the Internet typically requires a computer with the right software , a modem , a telephone line , and a subscription to an Internet service provider ( ISP ) . In the Philippines , the computer and modem would cost some P25 , 000 ( US $ 500 ) ; phone and ISP subscription combined would require around P1 , 000 ( US $ 20 ) or more per month . This is definitely beyond the reach of most poor families , though perhaps within reach of the middle class , if they are willing to drop other daily expenses . At these costs , the Internet would definitely remain an enclave of the rich . ( Verzola , 2002 ) anyone suffer the indignity of having their book go out of print after only 18 months because their publisher only brought out a hardback version , which cost £ 45 a time , and which few people except institutional libraries could afford to purchase ) . Now I realise that at this point some of you may be thinking : ' Yeah , yeah , more cyberbabble ! ' But despite what I said earlier about science-fiction this is all not quite so far fetched and utopian as it sounds . There are already a number of such ' free text ' sites in operation on the Internet . Perhaps the best known and most influential of these is the arXiv . o rg e-Print archive . Founded in 1991 by Paul Ginsparg and originally based at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before moving to Cornell University in December 2001 , this archive has carried over 215,000 submissions , has deposits of a further 25,000 every year , and receives 200,000 connections daily . arXiv . o rg works as follows . Whenever a scholar in the field of physics , maths , computing or non-linear sciences is about to submit a paper to a refereed scholarly journal for publication , they send a pre-print copy to this archive . This pre-print is then made available to any researcher , scholar or student who wants it , free of charge . They simply have to download the file from the archive . Nor does copyright present a problem . As an article that appeared in The Times Higher Education Supplement a couple of years ago made clear , the e-print archiving system is able to avoid falling foul of copyright agreements by means of what 's called the ' Harnad / Oppenheim preprint + corrigenda strategy ' : First the author posts a pre-print of his or her paper on the web . Then they submit the paper to a refereed journal . The author makes amendments in light of referees ' and editors' comments , then signs the publisher's copyright agreement . The author then posts a note onto the web pre-print , pointing out where areas of correction might need to be made , in effect turning the pre-print into a version of the draft refereed paper . ' If these steps are followed , the author has done nothing wrong , has broken no law and has not signed a contract he or she should not have signed ' . ( Patel , 2000 : 12 ) This last point is of course extremely important , as it highlights one of the major differences between the self-archiving of e-prints and Napster , and thus provides a means of overcoming what is , potentially , a major hurdle to making such a free academic text download site a real possibility ( as opposed to a mere science fiction fantasy ) . 2 After all , was n ' t Napster sued because it infringed the copyright of music companies and musicians to own the rights to , and profit from , their music ? Archiving academic texts electronically in the manner described above , however , is not illegal because of the way in which academia works . Unlike Sony , the Motion Picture Association of America , 3 Eminem , Britney Spears , Madonna , Metallica , Missy Elliott or even the vast majority of authors of other forms of writing ( novels , plays , screenplays , newspaper and magazine articles , computer programmes . ) , academics tend not to be too concerned about getting paid a fee for , or receive royalties from , their research publications . ( They 're in the wrong business if they are . ) As Stevan Harnad , one of the co-authors of the Harnad / Oppenheim preprint and corrigenda strategy , and himself a vociferous advocate of the e-print self-archiving system , has emphasised , the main priority of most academics is to have their research read by as many people as they can , in the hope of having the biggest possible impact on future research , and perhaps even society , and so they are perfectly willing to in effect give their work away for free to anyone who can bring this about . In fact this is often how academics derive their income - from ' how much they are read , cited , and built-upon by other researchers ' - as this tends to lead , either directly or indirectly , to employment , career advancement ( including tenure ) , salary increases , promotions , the awarding of grants , etc. ( Harnad , 2001 ) . One of the things that makes e-print archiving , and digital publishing in general , so attractive to many academic authors is therefore precisely the extent to which , by rendering their work freely and easily available to all those who can access it ( rather than restricting access merely to those who can afford to pay for it via the high cost of purchasing it in book or journal form , taking out a journal subscription fees , licensing deals , pay-per-view , etc. ) , it does make reaching a large audience a very real possibility . To provide an obvious example of what is achievable , even on just a relatively small scale , publishers in cultural studies will generally regard an academic journal as financially viable as long as it sells at least one hundred copies per issue . Most cultural studies journals , even quite well established ones , have circulations of only In an article written in honour of Stuart Hall and his activities over the years , Angela McRobbie describes being in the ' audience at an academic media and communications conference where a whole array of editors were on the stage and asked to give an update on publishing in their RAE rated journals ' . To her horror , not one of these editors so much as ' flinched when they described their readerships as a paltry 300 or 400 internationally ' ( McRobbie , 2000 : 219 ) . Myself , I 'm just surprised she was so surprised . Of course , these figures has to be qualified by the fact that , as most ' paper ' journals are purchased by university libraries , they are often read by far more people than actually buy them . The amount such journals may be photocopied , and the way a lot of them appear in multiple formats ( digital as well as paper , for instance ) , also has to be taken into account . Still , the figures McRobbie cites go a long way to explaining why so many new journals are being produced . After all , if individual journals only sell in the region of 500 copies or so per edition , one way for publishers to sell more journals is to increase the number of titles they publish - especially if they have a captive market in university libraries who are likely to feel obliged to subscribe to most if not all the journals produced in a particular area . Considering that publishers pay for neither the content , the editing , nor the peer-review process that makes these journals possible ( and that the yearly subscription to at least one journal in the sciences , Brain Research , costs over £ 9000 , with others in the humanities and social sciences already operating on a ' pay-to-play basis ' , the Journal of Information Technology charging $ US200 reader's fee for reviewing the article and then $ US100 per page that is actually published ) , academic journal publishing can be extremely profitable . 400-600 copies internationally . Compare this to the fact that Culture Machine achieved a circulation of 6,500 ( i . e . at least 10 times that amount ) in the first 10 months of its existence alone , and only 3 years later ( 2001-2 ) was receiving as many as 375,000 hits per annum , which works out as somewhere between 40 , 000-50 , 000 individual accesses , or approximately 4,000 readers a month on average . Nor should those writers and authors who do want to profit directly from their work automatically dismiss the potential benefits of the e-archiving system . A recent study of writers by The Society of Authors found that most had to supplement their very low annual earnings with other forms of work and that : . o nly a handful of writers earn the huge advances which take up so many column inches in the press . Indeed , in writing , five per cent earn on average over £ 75,000 and ' three quarters of members earned less than the national average wage ; and two-thirds less than half the average wage and one half less than the minimum wage ... ' ( Pool , 2000 ; cited in McRobbie , 2002 ) So the argument that writers of for-profit texts risk losing money , or not making it all , by self-archiving their work does not really apply . Unfortunately , the vast majority of authors simply have no money to lose ; like academics , they , too , could in fact gain from the increase in potential readers and exposure . CSeARCH By now the impact an equivalent archive to that at Cornell , or the CogPrints archive that has been put together for cognitive psychology at the University of Southampton by Harnad ( or the DSpace ' super-archive ' that has recently been launched by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , for that matter ) could potentially have on cultural studies is hopefully becoming clear . Which is why Culture Machine , working in association with the Mediactive group at Middlesex University , is shortly to launch just such a cultural studies e-print archive ( called , imaginatively enough , the Cultural Studies e-Archive - or CSeARCH , for short ) . The idea is to join with those at Cornell and Southampton as part of the Open Archives Initiative , which is described - somewhat problematically in my view , it has to be said , but that 's an argument for another day - as being in effect one global , virtual archive of jointly searchable academic work . Among other things the CSeARCH electronic archive will enable those in the cultural studies field to : publish their research , and make it widely available as a result , immediately upon completion - before it comes out in either journal or book form ( which can take between 18 months and 2 years from submission of the final manuscript ) ; even before it has gone through the peer review process if they wish , as that can also take a considerable amount of time ; attach a record of all the various stages of the research they wish to record - from pre-refereeing , through successive revisions , to the refereed , journal / publisher-certified publication , including any subsequently corrected , revised , or otherwise updated drafts ; make their work available for free to anyone who can access it - and not just to those who can afford to pay to read it via book fees , journal subscription fees , etc. As Stevan Harnad notes , obviously ' [ r ] esearchers in developing countries and at the less affluent universities and research institutions of developed countries will benefit even more from barrier-free access to the research literature than will the better-off institutions , but it is instructive to remind ourselves that even the most affluent institutional libraries can not afford most of the refereed journals ! None have access to more than a small subset of the entire annual corpus ' ( Harnad , 2001 ) ; provide their audience , including students , with as many copies of their work as they like - simply by supplying their readers with the address where they can find them on the net and download them or print them off for free ; advertise and promote their texts for free - all authors need to do is send out the relevant addresses by email . This enables individual writers to be far more accurate when targeting an audience for their works , as they can send details to people who they know will be interested : students , colleagues , peers , etc ; potentially increase reading figures , impact and even sales of their paper publications - rather than detracting from them , as many publishers fear , publishing on the web frequently increases sales of paper copies , as the ( now ex ) chairman of Faber and Faber , Matthew Evans , acknowledged during a recent talk ( Evans , 2002 ) ; publish books and journals which have too small a potential readership to make them cost effective for a ' paper ' publisher to take on - because they are seen as being perhaps too ' advanced ' , ' specialised ' , ' esoteric ' or ' avant-garde ' ; make their research ' permanently ' available - so authors no longer need concern themselves with the thought that their work may go out of print or become otherwise unavailable ; re-publish texts which have gone out of print - and this applies to journal articles as well as full-length books ; revise and update their research whenever they wish - so authors need no longer worry about their work going out of date ; distribute their research to an extremely wide ( if not necessarily ' global ' ) audience - rather than reaching merely the specific audiences their publishers think they can market and sell their work to ( in cultural studies' case , primarily just the US , UK and Australia ) ; encourage browsing by enabling even those readers who still prefer to purchase a paper copy to read the texts concerned first - this is simply not possible on Amazon . c om , nor increasingly in the conventional bookselling market , as bookstores are taking fewer and fewer ' academic ' titles . As a result , the element of chance and serendipity traditionally associated with browsing in a bookshop is brought back . In addition authors will have all the advantages associated with electronic publication , including ease of navigation and searching , speed of access , ability to link citations to other electronic texts and to link their texts to other multimedia material in general . To provide just one quick example : individual journal articles are rarely included in library catalogues . Digital academic texts , however , can be easily indexed and searched , even to the level of specific words and phrases . All this will be available for free - to both authors and their readers . What 's more , thanks to the Harnad / Oppenheim preprint + corrigenda strategy cultural studies writers and scholars can still publish any research placed in the archive as journal articles or academic monographs ; and do so without fear of infringing copyright agreements . A variation on this theme even works for articles and books that have already been accepted for publication in a referred journal , or which are already in print . ' Simply do a revised 2nd edition ! Update the references , rearrange the text ( and add more text and data if you wish ) . For the record , the enhanced draft can be accompanied by a "" de-corrigenda "" file , stating which of the enhancements were not in the published version ' ( Harnad , 2001 ) . 4 Indeed , as far as cultural studies is concerned this last point is probably almost as important as the self-archiving system's ability to circumvent the problem of copyright , since it has the effect of rendering the Harnad / Oppenheim preprint and corrigenda strategy much more appropriate and appealing to a field which - partly because it does not place so much I t makes little sense for academic libraries to be purchasing journals which no one actually reads , and whose main value to the community is their ' citability ' . The logical resolution to this absurdity , as Harnad has advanced in his work , is for the journal titles to continue to exist but primarily to provide the function of quality control , the organisation of peer review . The titles should continue , almost certainly in electronic-only form , and will continue to pick up subscriptions - perhaps from individual subscribers , or members of the learned societies who publish them in many cases , rather than from academic libraries - but will not depend upon library subscriptions for their existence . Their economic basis will change as they disinvest in the machinery of print and electronic distribution , scaling down their production to a much reduced level ( and abandoning print distribution entirely ) , and will be funded through charges levied on academic and research institutions for the provision of peer-review services . ( MacColl , 2002 ) emphasis on the speed with which results are shared , published and communicated - lacks the history and culture of pre-print exchange of many physical science disciplines . Despite everything I 've said so far , however , the advantages this process offers to cultural studies teaching and research are not the only reason why a number of us who are involved with Culture Machine are interested in the self-archiving of e-prints . For example , we 're not putting it forward merely as a possible solution to the hunt that is now on within the MLA , as a result of Stephen Greenblatt's open letter on the ' Problems in Scholarly Book Publishing ' to find an alternative criterion for tenure to books - the most obvious candidate being the refereed journal article , with the idea of ' attaching equal weight to peer-reviewed electronic publications ' interestingly being My preference . would be to encourage a greater diversity of types of publication , where perhaps the rules of anonymous peer reviewing and all the paraphernalia involved in getting RAE-rated work into print might be suspended in favour of attention to the quality of the written work and the spirit of experiment and innovation . The system the RAE has put in place operates as a means of disciplining young scholars to conform to the rules of their seniors . In a nutshell , they have to go through the route of the established journals rather than start their own . This is also a constraint on critique and on healthy intellectual subordination . ( McRobbie , 2000 : 220 ) one of the options reportedly also under consideration ( Phillips , 2002 : 18 ) . Nor are we motivated simply by a belief that knowledge should n ' t be owned , copyrighted or exchanged by publishers for profit , and that it should instead be made available for free ( or at least relatively cheaply ) to ( almost ) everyone - a conviction that has recently led 32,362 research scientists in 183 countries to boycott any scientific journal which refuses to make research papers freely available on the internet 6 months after publication ; and when that boycott failed , since younger scholars in particular found they still had to publish in those journals in order to embark on their careers , to launch their own free online journals ( Meak , 2001 : 3 ; MacLeod , 2003 : 9 ) . And we 're certainly not advocating it as a way of making money for publishers . In other words , we do n't see e-print archiving as representing a new , alternative form of capitalism or even post-capitalism , one that is potentially more effective in the context of what 's called variously the ' digital ' or ' knowledge economy ' . The reason we 're so interested in electronic archiving is due to the ethical and political questions it raises for academic and institutional authority and legitimacy : the way NapsterXivation , as I 'll nickname it , promises to transform and redefine our relationship to knowledge . To be continued ... 5 Endnotes 1 According to Duncan Campbell and Stuart Miller , more than ' 8bn music files were swapped online ' in 2001 ( Campbell & Miller , 2002 : 5 ) , while members of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry are reported as having ' closed down more than 1,000 illicit music sites ' in 2001 ( Cassy , 2002 : 20 ) . 2 This is of course not the only important difference between them . Another concerns the way in which the e-print archiving system , at least as it is characterized by arXiv . o rg , is based on a database , hosted on a central server , which is used to collect , publish and store written academic texts . Napster , by contrast , is a music file sharing tool based around a central directory which lists the data that is being offered for exchange by other registered participants . Neither arXiv . o rg nor Napster is therefore what is called a P2P ( peer-to-peer ) networking system , at least not in the proper sense of the term . P2P file sharing systems such as Gnutella and Kazaa consist of a de-centralised network of connected machines that are independent of either a centralised server or a centralised directory . 3 In March 2002 the Motion Picture Association of America began a legal action against MusicCity . c om and others for swapping ' pirated ' television programmes and films online . According to Campbell and Miller , approximately ' 11m Americans are now swapping television programmes and films online and are downloading an estimated 350,000 moves from the internet everyday ' ( Campbell & Miller , 2002 : 5 ) . 4 As Harnard makes clear , this strategy is designed to be employed only in those cases where a publisher will not expressly allow the self-archiving of the refereed pre-prints . Such cases are rarer than one might think . Harnad cites figures to the effect that approximately 10 % of journal publishers already explicitly allow self-archiving of the refereed postprint . Others , ' ( perhaps 70 % ) ' , will also allow authors to modify their copyright transfer agreement forms with something along the lines of the following clause , ' but only if you explicitly propose it yourself ( they will not formulate it on their own initiative ) ' : I hereby transfer to [ publisher or journal ] all rights to sell or lease the text ( on-paper and on-line ) of my paper [ paper-title ] . I retain only the right to distribute it for free for scholarly / scientific purposes , in particular , the right to self-archive it publicly online on the Web . ( Harnad , 2001 ) If you ask nicely most journal publishers will generally release articles for self-archiving at some stage once the journal issue in question has been published , as after a certain date they have no real sale value : As to the past ( retrospective ) literature : the Harnad / Oppenheim preprint + corrigenda strategy will not work there , but as the retrospective journal literature brings virtually no revenue , most publishers will agree to author self-archiving after a sufficient period ( 6 months to 2 years ) has elapsed . Moreover , for the really old literature , it is not clear that on-line self-archiving was covered by the old copyright agreements at all . ( Harnad , 2001 ) But even if publishers do respond to such ventures , as some have predicted , by getting together and agreeing between themselves to no longer wave copyright and allow self-archiving of pre - and post-prints ( although why should they : after all , arXiv . o rg has been operating for over 10 years now without any such difficulty ) there is a case to be made for academics just cutting out the middle-man ( i . e . the publishing houses ) and taking the means of production into their own hands and simply publishing their work for , and by , themselves . After all , as I pointed earlier , academics are rarely paid , either substantially or directly , for any of the writing , editorial work or refereeing that goes into the production of scholarly journals , publishers getting all this work for free . 5 See Hall ( 2003 ) .

36	"Luke 1 Introduction 1 Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled [ a ] among us , 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word . 3 Therefore , since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning , it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you , most excellent Theophilus , 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught . The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold 5 In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah , who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah ; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron . 6 Both of them were upright in the sight of God , observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly . 7 But they had no children , because Elizabeth was barren ; and they were both well along in years . 8 Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God , 9 he was chosen by lot , according to the custom of the priesthood , to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense . 10 And when the time for the burning of incense came , all the assembled worshipers were praying outside . 11 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him , standing at the right side of the altar of incense . 12 When Zechariah saw him , he was startled and was gripped with fear . 13 But the angel said to him : "" Do not be afraid , Zechariah ; your prayer has been heard . Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and you are to give him the name John . 14 He will be a joy and delight to you , and many will rejoice because of his birth , 15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord . He is never to take wine or other fermented drink , and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth . [ b ] 16 Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God . 17 And he will go on before the Lord , in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous – to make ready a people prepared for the Lord . "" 18 Zechariah asked the angel , "" How can I be sure of this ? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years . "" 19 The angel answered , "" I am Gabriel . I stand in the presence of God , and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news . 20 And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens , because you did not believe my words , which will come true at their proper time . "" 21 Meanwhile , the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple . 22 When he came out , he could not speak to them . They realized he had seen a vision in the temple , for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak . 23 When his time of service was completed , he returned home . 24 After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion . 25 "" The Lord has done this for me , "" she said . "" In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people . "" The Birth of Jesus Foretold 26 In the sixth month , God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth , a town in Galilee , 27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph , a descendant of David . The virgin's name was Mary . 28 The angel went to her and said , "" Greetings , you who are highly favored ! The Lord is with you . "" 29 Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be . 30 But the angel said to her , "" Do not be afraid , Mary , you have found favor with God . 31 You will be with child and give birth to a son , and you are to give him the name Jesus . 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High . The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David , 33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever ; his kingdom will never end . "" 34 "" How will this be , "" Mary asked the angel , "" since I am a virgin ? "" 35 The angel answered , "" The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you . So the holy one to be born will be called [ c ] the Son of God . 36 Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age , and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month . 37 For nothing is impossible with God . "" 38 "" I am the Lord's servant , "" Mary answered . "" May it be to me as you have said . "" Then the angel left her . Mary Visits Elizabeth 39 At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea , 40 where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth . 41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting , the baby leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit . 42 In a loud voice she exclaimed : "" Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the child you will bear ! 43 But why am I so favored , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ? 44 As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears , the baby in my womb leaped for joy . 45 Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished ! "" Mary's Song 46 And Mary said : "" My soul glorifies the Lord 47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior , 48 for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant . From now on all generations will call me blessed , 49 for the Mighty One has done great things for me – holy is his name . 50 His mercy extends to those who fear him , from generation to generation . 51 He has performed mighty deeds with his arm ; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts . 52 He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble . 53 He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty . 54 He has helped his servant Israel , remembering to be merciful 55 to Abraham and his descendants forever , even as he said to our fathers . "" 56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home . The Birth of John the Baptist 57 When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby , she gave birth to a son . 58 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy , and they shared her joy . 59 On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah , 60 but his mother spoke up and said , "" No ! He is to be called John . "" 61 They said to her , "" There is no one among your relatives who has that name . "" 62 Then they made signs to his father , to find out what he would like to name the child . 63 He asked for a writing tablet , and to everyone's astonishment he wrote , "" His name is John . "" 64 Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed , and he began to speak , praising God . 65 The neighbors were all filled with awe , and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things . 66 Everyone who heard this wondered about it , asking , "" What then is this child going to be ? "" For the Lord's hand was with him . Zechariah's Song 67 His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied : 68 "" Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel , because he has come and has redeemed his people . 69 He has raised up a horn [ d ] of salvation for us in the house of his servant David 70 ( as he said through his holy prophets of long ago ) , 71 salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us – 72 to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant , 73 the oath he swore to our father Abraham : 74 to rescue us from the hand of our enemies , and to enable us to serve him without fear 75 in holiness and righteousness before him all our days . 76 And you , my child , will be called a prophet of the Most High ; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him , 77 to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins , 78 because of the tender mercy of our God , by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven 79 to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the path of peace . "" 80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit ; and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel . Luke 2 The Birth of Jesus 1 In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world . 2 ( This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria . ) 3 And everyone went to his own town to register . 4 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea , to Bethlehem the town of David , because he belonged to the house and line of David . 5 He went there to register with Mary , who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child . 6 While they were there , the time came for the baby to be born , 7 and she gave birth to her firstborn , a son . She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger , because there was no room for them in the inn . The Shepherds and the Angels 8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby , keeping watch over their flocks at night . 9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them , and they were terrified . 10 But the angel said to them , "" Do not be afraid . I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people . 11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you ; he is Christ [ a ] the Lord . 12 This will be a sign to you : You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger . "" 13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel , praising God and saying , 14 "" Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests . "" 15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven , the shepherds said to one another , "" Let 's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has told us about . "" 16 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph , and the baby , who was lying in the manger . 17 When they had seen him , they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child , 18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them . 19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart . 20 The shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen , which were just as they had been told . Jesus Presented in the Temple 21 On the eighth day , when it was time to circumcise him , he was named Jesus , the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived . 22 When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed , Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord 23 ( as it is written in the Law of the Lord , "" Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord "" [ b ] ) , 24 and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord : "" a pair of doves or two young pigeons . "" [ c ] 25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon , who was righteous and devout . He was waiting for the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was upon him . 26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ . 27 Moved by the Spirit , he went into the temple courts . When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required , 28 Simeon took him in his arms and praised God , saying : 29 "" Sovereign Lord , as you have promised , you now dismiss [ d ] your servant in peace . 30 For my eyes have seen your salvation , 31 which you have prepared in the sight of all people , 32 a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel . "" 33 The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him . 34 Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary , his mother : "" This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel , and to be a sign that will be spoken against , 35 so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed . And a sword will pierce your own soul too . "" 36 There was also a prophetess , Anna , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher . She was very old ; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage , 37 and then was a widow until she was eighty-four . [ e ] She never left the temple but worshiped night and day , fasting and praying . 38 Coming up to them at that very moment , she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem . 39 When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord , they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth . 40 And the child grew and became strong ; he was filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was upon him . The Boy Jesus at the Temple 41 Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover . 42 When he was twelve years old , they went up to the Feast , according to the custom . 43 After the Feast was over , while his parents were returning home , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem , but they were unaware of it . 44 Thinking he was in their company , they traveled on for a day . Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends . 45 When they did not find him , they went back to Jerusalem to look for him . 46 After three days they found him in the temple courts , sitting among the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions . 47 Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers . 48 When his parents saw him , they were astonished . His mother said to him , "" Son , why have you treated us like this ? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you . "" 49 "" Why were you searching for me ? "" he asked . "" Did n't you know I had to be in my Father's house ? "" 50 But they did not understand what he was saying to them . 51 Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them . But his mother treasured all these things in her heart . 52 And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature , and in favor with God and men ."	6

316	Rats That Bite There is an argument that suggests that any rat that bites should be humanely destroyed , as a biting rat is not acceptable as a pet . While I agree with that in part , there are also a whole host of reasons why this does not have to be the ' unwritten law ' of rat keeping . Pet rats are generally kept in cages - they can not bite anyone outside their cage , only someone who infringes on their territory by putting their fingers through the bars , or their hand through the door . Being a biter does not necessarily make the rat dangerous ( as long as you follow basic rules , like NOT sticking your fingers through the bars ) , neither does it mean that the rat in question ca n ' t have a long and fulfilled life ( it may be perfectly happy with cage mates ) . As an owner , you have to decide whether you are willing to accept the constraints of a biting rat and whether you are willing to put in the time and effort to correct this character flaw . You also have to consider , especially if there are children involved , whether it is realistic to even attempt to do this - it may be wiser to pass the rat over to someone else who is less interested in having the rat as a cuddly pet . It is very rare for pet rats to aggressively bite , but they can and will bite for a whole host of other reasons . Understanding the reason ( s ) can help an owner overcome the problem , or at least allow themselves not to be hurt when dealing with a particular rat , as well as allowing the rat to lead as normal a life as possible . The primary cause of any bite is fear . A well-socialised regularly handled rat is highly unlikely to bite compared to a solitary un-handled rat . Unfortunately , unless you buy your rats from reputable breeders , you will have no way of telling how socialised your new friends are until you try to pick them up - they may be used to the person in the pet shop , picking them up for short periods or shooing them out of the way while their cages are cleaned , but that does not mean they can cope with , or understand , the loving attentiveness of a new owner . As an owner you must be patient and understanding , giving your new friends time to settle into their new environment and introducing yourself to them slowly and carefully . Start off by just resting your hand in their cage , so they can get used to your smell , or try putting an old t-shirt that you 've recently worn in their cage . You will be able to tell , quite easily , which of your new rats are nervous and which are quite happy to see you : nervous rats will cower , run away , move in a jerky manner and make every attempt to avoid your hand at all costs ! This is when you need to be extra patient because the one thing that will get a rat to investigate you is curiosity . By talking calmly to the rats and not making any sudden movements , even the shyest of kittens will try and sneak a sniff , a lick or even a ' is it edible ? ' nip ( which wo n ' t hurt you at all ! ) . Trust building exercises , like letting rats lick yummy stuff from your fingers , help to teach the rat to associate hands with nice things and also that fingers are not for biting , only for licking . When venturing to pick up your baby rats , NEVER EVER pick them up by the tail - either use a scooping motion supporting the tummy , or place your first 2 fingers either side of their neck , just above the shoulders , with your thumb and remaining fingers supporting their tummy . You obviously ca n ' t do this with bigger rats , unless you have big hands ! Once you 've scooped them up you must support their feet : rats feel very vunerable when left dangling in mid-air ! When you first get your baby rats out of their cage , do n't go too far with them - stay close to the cage so that they can still smell it and , if they panic , you can easily put them back . You must handle your baby rats daily , for at least 20 minutes - there is a theory that a baby rat can not stay frightened for more than 20 minutes so , by handling them for at least this length of time in any one go , they will realise that there 's nothing to be frightened of . However , some rats are far more nervous than others , and can show obvious distress at being handled after only a very short time . Stress is very bad for rats so I would suggest that nervous rats should have their handling time gradually increased - a little amount of handling but several times a day . If they are particularly nervous you will need to make sure they do n't associate your visits with just being handled : on one visit to the cage handle them , on the next give them a treat , on the next just have your hand in etc. If you do have nervous babies , it may be worth considering not giving them a covered bed or bolt-hole in their cage : this may seem a bit harsh but most pet shops do not provide cover and , for the first few weeks at least , it will be easier for you to handle the rats if you do n't have to chase them round the cage or fish them out of a hidey-hole ! Gradual but continual ( and that 's the key ! ) trust building will socialise your rats in no time and , though it wo n ' t guarantee a shoulder or lap rat ( that depends on the personality of the rat ) , it will almost certainly guarantee that your baby rats wo n ' t grow up to be biters ! Older rats that bite are more of a problem and the reasons behind their biting can be more complex and harder to figure out . If you ' adopt ' an adult biter , you have no way of telling whether it has been handled regularly , whether it has been mistreated or whether it is insecure and unsocialised . Trust training can also work with adult rats , though will probably take longer and require a lot more persistence on your part . Thick gardening gloves can be worn to minimise the risk of damage to fingers , or some people use a thick towel to scoop or catch the rat in , should it be necessary to handle it . You have to decide whether this will stress the rat out and undo all your hard work of trust training , or whether you should ignore the handling aspect of socialising your rat until it feels safe in your company and is used to you lightly touching or brushing it with your fingers . There is no need to feel rushed in your socialisation and trust training of your new rat - each rat is different and each will take their own time to ' come round ' to your way of thinking ! Being naturally sociable animals , it is very rare for a rat to just be aggressive and unhandleable with no hope of character redemption , but any rat that exhibits outward unprovoked aggression should NEVER be bred from . Responsible breeders breed as much for character as they do for colouring and they socialise their rats almost from birth , getting them used to being handled from an early age - a good reason to consider buying your rats from breeders rather than pet shops , which can sometimes breed and sell rodents for reptile food ( ' feeders ' ) and are consequently uninterested in the character and health of the animals they produce . Whether from a breeder or a shop always get at least a pair of same sex rats . If buying from a pet shop , unless you know the shop to be reputable , get young , recently weaned rats . Wherever you buy your new pets from , the time spent building bonds can be one of the most rewarding experiences of rat ownership , so have fun !	7
1372	Because we live in a society where everything is fast paced – where folks are always on the go and yearning for the opportunity to decide how they 'd like to watch TV , video or listen to music – accessibility has become very important to ones living . A large number of Web TV services have sprung up over the web with the arrival of web technology that continues to steam forward to meet consumer needs . The way things use to be during the past when consumers were limited to their TVs is not the case nowadays . Give thanks to Internet connecting mobile devices and computers that let you download apps / software to get fast , easy access to all kinds of free content , or at minimal cost , across the world . Take for example a service like iSatelliteLink that offers software which can be downloaded to any Windows-based desktop or laptop with a wireless or preferred broadband web connection . And they provide more accessibility when offering a 3 in 1 package consisting of TvonPC , mobile compatibility , and legal film downloads . Now consumers can watch whatever they desire , on the go , without the utilization of a TV-set . Where technology is today one can only guess what lies ahead , as leading edge technology raises the bar and continues to gear itself toward the web . There 's something you can be certain of – More paid TV subscribers will cut the cord or dish and opt for the cheapest route , even if it implies giving up some of the higher quality to some extent . In turn , they will get fast and easy access to their favourite content from any location and that 's where a lot of folks will be headed – Internet TV .	4

1195	"Take Action – Now ! If it 's going to be , it 's up to me In my clinical practice , I treat people who suffer from just about every imaginable emotional malady – depression , anxiety , anger , addictions , eating disorders , sexual malfunctions , obsessions and compulsions , borderline personality disorders , impulsive acting out , relationship dysfunction , and on and on . To every single one of my patients , I emphasize how important it is for them to step up to the plate and take responsibility for their recovery . How do I do this ? I first help them understand the precise nature and cause of their problems . Then , in the spirit of what the psychologist Carl Rogers taught , "" Insight is necessary but not sufficient , "" I do my best to convince them that , to get better , they need to work hard , really hard , not only during our sessions , but also in the days between our sessions . I tell them : "" The measly forty-five minutes you spend with me each week pales in comparison to the hours you spend with yourself , unwittingly rehearsing and practicing your irrational thinking and dysfunctional behavior . I 'll do everything in my power to teach you what to do , but , if you do n't work your therapy every day , you could very well come to our next appointment next week worse than better . "" In this vein , I make it a point to never let a patient leave my office without at least one between-session therapy assignment . It can be some therapeutic reading , a cognitive restructuring assignment , a behavioral task , or some combination of all three . It never fails that when patients works their therapy , every day , with vigor and focus , they get better . The same dedication to work applies to creating happiness . All the wonderful happiness strategies in the world will be for naught unless you are willing to use them to bring happiness into your life . If you work them , life will get better . If you do n't , it wo n't . It 's that simple . ACT So , dear reader , here 's your chance to get organized , get focused , and most important , get to work to increase your happiness quotient . I share below a three-step process I call ACT – A refers to creating your Action Plan for Happiness ; C has to do with your massive Commitment to do what it takes to bring more pleasure , satisfaction , and happiness into your life ; T means Turning On the Action . So , let 's swing into ACTion – now ! Action Plan For Happiness Starting way back on February 19 , 2013 , and then each month thereafter , I have published a series of thirty blogs , each with a profound , powerful happiness action strategy . The first ten focused on ways to be happy with yourself ( blogs 2 / 19 / 13 – 10 / 31 / 13 ) , the next ten on how to create happiness with others ( 11 / 30 / 13 – 8 / 31 / 14 ) , and the last ten on ways to be happy with life in general ( 9 / 30 / 14 – 6 / 30 / 15 ) . In each package of ten , the first five strategies are cognitive or attitudinal , the second five behavioral things to do . Whether you 've followed my blogs month-by-month , logged in here and there , or are a first-timer , I suggest that you take the time to browse through these blogs . This may take some time and energy on your part . But , I think your happiness is worth it , do n't you ? Once you 've done this , you are to select one strategy you will begin to do to be happier with yourself , with others , and with life . Write them down below . For each , make notes about where , when , and with whom you 'll act out these strategies . My Action Plan Happiness With Self Strategy : Happiness With Others Strategy : Happiness With Life Strategy : Commitment All right , great job ! You 've created a concrete happiness action plan that can add tons of pleasure and satisfaction to your life . But , all the plans in the world , without action , will be useless . You need to commit to follow through . Consider what the genius , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe : "" At the moment of commitment , the entire universe conspires to assist you . "" Here now are three ways for you to get and stay motivated to act out your Action Plan for Happiness each and every day . 1 . Benefits / Costs . Too often people focus on how difficult and cumbersome it is to do what is good for them . They tell themselves , "" It 's too hard , "" "" I do n't have the time , "" "" I 've got too much to do . "" Worse , they often also focus on the benefits of the short-range pleasure of lounging and doing nothing : "" I think I 'll just flip on the TV / read the newspaper while I sip coffee / kick up my feet and close my eyes . "" Unwittingly , this combination of focusing on the cost of action and on the pleasures of inaction demotivates them from acting to bring themselves long-range happiness . You want to reverse this by using costs and benefits to your advantage . What you want to do is focus both on the benefits of following through on your happiness action plan and the costs of inaction . If you keep clear about the benefits of doing and the costs of not doing , you strengthen your commitment to act . Now , take a few minutes to identify as many benefits to acting on your happiness action plan and as many costs as you to not acting . Remember : Your happiness may very well depend on your motivation . My Benefit / Cost Motivator The Profound Benefits of Happiness Action : The Profound Cost of Happiness Inaction : 2 . Rewards and Punishments . It is human nature to move toward pleasure and away from pain . The good news is that you can purposely use pleasure and pain to your advantage by rewarding yourself for acting on your action plan and punishing yourself for choosing not to act . Take a few minutes to do the exercise below . My Reward / Punishment Plan Reward : What do I have available every day that I enjoy ( e.g. , reading the newspaper , lounging in the hot tub , dessert ) that I will only allow myself to enjoy if I act on my Action Plan ? Punishment : What is something I dislike that I will use to punish myself for failing to act on my Action Plan ( e.g. , cleaning the bathroom , sending a $ 50 check to your least favorite political candidate , doing 25 push-ups ) ? 3 . Support . Athletes have coaches , creative writers have editors , politicians have advisers . These individuals recognize that it is next to impossible for them to create the results they 're after without a strong support system . The same goes for people like you and me who want to be happier in our lives . It is always helpful to have people who will commit themselves to supporting us to achieve our goals . Below , list three people you trust whom you will ask to support you on following through on your Action Plan for Happiness . What exactly will you ask them to do ? Turning On The Action The last and most important step is for you to act . Yes , act . Nothing ever happens without a person doing what is necessary to make it happen . Let me quote again from Goethe : "" Knowing is not enough ; we must apply . Willing is not enough ; we must do . "" So , now , right now , begin the process of integrating your Action Plan into the fabric of your life . To help you hold yourself accountable , I offer to you the following chart for you to record what you have done . Make fifty-two copies . Then , each week check off daily when you have acted on your plan . Going Forward I want to end this blog by quoting , one last time , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe . He said : "" Whatever you can do or dream you can , begin it . Boldness has genius , power and magic in it . "" There 's so much wisdom in that quote . But , to pare it down to its basics , it communicates in beautiful words what I 've preached throughout this blog : act , act boldly , because that , and only that , is the royal road to bring happiness into your life . Please , for you , not for me , begin to act on your Action Plan for Happiness , for your boldness has the power to magically change your life for the better . As always , know that I support you in your quest for Happiness on Purpose . Contact me at anytime by email and I will respond . Looking ahead , I will devote the next several blogs to teaching you how to bring more happiness into your relationship with your significant other . I look forward to it , as I hope you do . In the meantime , live healthy , happy , and with passion ."	7
606	"Things to worry about , and having faith Posted on Mar 3rd , 2011 . 3134 comments When my son was one minute old , he taught me something about life . The nurse handed him to me and in those first few seconds , I felt relief . The months of anxiety were over . My naïve thought was : I can stop worrying now . I held onto that belief for as long as it took to exhale and draw in one breath . Then I realized my worries were n't over . They were just beginning . So I guess what I learned was : It never ends . Zane's eighteen now . Things have more or less worked out . Still , last night my wife woke up around midnight , worried that he did n't have enough gas to get to school in the morning . I could hear rain hitting the window . I almost asked if she wanted me to go out and check the gauge . But I did n't . Never ask a question you do n't want to know the answer to . A manuscript is like a kid that way , at least for me . The day Tin House said they 'd take my book , I thought I 'd reached the finish line . Instead , there 's a whole new universe of things to obsess over . Should I be promoting it more ? Am I tweeting too much ? What if Tin House has changed their mind about publishing it ? I have n't heard from them in a while . Should I call them just to be sure ? What about reviews ? Should I even read them ? Last Sunday I finished Tom Grimes' brilliant memoir , Mentor . It 's the story of Grimes' life as a writer and his time at the Iowa Writers' Workshop . Grimes' mentor is Frank Conroy ; their relationship is at the heart of the story . It 's an amazing book . Publishers Weekly gave it a starred review . Initially , I thought the appeal of reading Mentor would be in seeing the path I did n't take . At about the same time Grimes went to Iowa , I quit my day job , started freelancing and tried to teach myself to write fiction . I thought it would take five years . It took much longer . But although those two paths are different , they have something in common . A writer's life is irrational , as Grimes says Conroy says . And you inflict all sorts of crap on yourself along the way . Irrational worries . Twice I put the book down and said , that 's enough . It 's too close to the bone . The problem is , it 's not the kind of book you can stop reading . When I finished Mentor on Sunday night , one gift it gave me was a sense of resolve . I promised myself not to let the world define Wire to Wire for me . Reviews do n't matter . The world , being a kind and gentle place , let me hold onto that belief for almost 12 hours before outing me as a hypocrite . The next morning Publishers Weekly gave Wire to Wire a starred review and made it Pick of the Week . So hold that thought . It turns out reviews do matter . As long as they 're good . As for my resolve not to read them ... hey , revision is everything in writing . That includes revising my beliefs . Somebody tell me if I 'm tweeting too much , though . Sometimes you gotta lose it , just to lose it , just to find it again : Alejandro Escovedo says you gotta have "" Faith . "" 11 Posted by ManuelOwek on August 6th , 2015 at 10 : 04 PM"	1
1628	"Received , at last , one more Judicial Review ' Refusal ' , ' on the papers ' , refused by last month's ' Breach of a Restraning Order ' trial judge , His Honour Judge Curran , on some bl == dy nonsense over whether or not a ' Restraining Order ' was ever served on me in the cells as if there was not ample contemporaneous records about ! Originating from , if true , this very ' Harassment ' issue , £ 50 fine , ' shoot to kill ' hearings and Section 39 abuse , under review in this very JR application ! So who blocks the investigation the most senior Cardiff Crown court judge ... anything to block exposure of the truth ... corruption is just rife around here or is it me with some brain disorder ? While the prosecution barrister , David Garreth Evans apolgised to the jury , for not being available as my main defence witness , he still having an early version of this now , ubiquitous ' restraining order ' in his pocket . The District Judge John Charles' Magistrates court 's , custody and cell cctv records are , meantime , quickly being shredded , re written or burnt , in fear the law , that Litigants in Person are not , as of right , entitled to public court records , may get itself repealed in Westminster .. So , if the CPS has a copy in his pocket , partly hand written by John Charles , then what is prosecution exhibit 1 , labelled ' 1st December11 Restraining Order ' , doing with the jury when it is date stamped 9th Dec ? So another version , slipped under my police door on 23rd Dec 11 , is the first one I see but different also from exhibit 1 . Very strange . Very strange , indeed , for the police did not e-mail me one , as promised , on the 19th Dec , over the phone from Llantwit police station . Oh , very odd ...... but hang on a minute that must be the one they quickly printed up following my unexpected appeal to Crown Court , in England , on the 7th Dec , no ? But I went to the magistrates court and told they had no record at all of any restraining order . But , of course , John Charles , had , in his fit of peak , scribbled out a section 4 ' restraining order ' , contrary to the Section 2 Harassment Act , currently before the court , to obtain a maximum jail term , if broken . Someone in HM Partnership , however , must have blocked it because the 8th Dec version , created on computor and ' certificate of conviction ' has omitted the ' fear of violence ' phrase on it . Stop worrying Maurice , Gareth , you will remember , told the jury he was checking up with his local bar council that all is ok and that the apparant conspiracy , witnessed by his friends in the public gallery , of CPS and Charles hatching a diversion , was going rapidly pear shaped . Muttering over court exhibits , I remember and I never saw . I heard Gareth and judge mumble , ' switch them ' and we will have him locked away . Fortunately , all was tape recorded and smuggled out of court as a procautionary matter in case the cabal are setting me up , again , to be shot by South Wales Police marksmen . All this was discussed , in detail , during the IAP and MAPPA police HQ meetings in June 2009 . Operation Orchid and Operation Chalice , re machine gun and snatching my younger daughter , were foiled but hey will get it right next time , I fear . Remember , They control the Welsh IPCC , Welsh GMC , Welsh Bar Council and their Cardiff Bay ' talking shop ' , Wales' big mistake for its best future ..... their key members are entrenched , all in the same lodge and ready to do more damage for the devil . Any way , not to worry ' justice ' is in a safe pair of hands ..... His Honour ordered Gareth to nip back up to his Crown Prosecution Service office , in Merthyr Tydfil and get the Restraining Order , serve it to me so we can all go home . But , over night , we all forget except for two on the jury . They are starting to work out the judge's cunning plan only to be thwarted , following their request for sight of the custody records that service ever took place in the cells below that chaotic December magistrates court hearing when I was refused the usual right to cross examine , call witnesses , finish my evidence , have any legal papers or even have pen and paper in my cell . "" Do not trouble your pretty heads "" , Judge Curran must have said , "" the court record of there ever being printed a ' restraining order and served , all on that day , is irrelevant to Maurice's blatent guilt "" . "" and as for the two cameras , he referred to , one in his special padded isolation cell , with £ 5000 ' see through ' door , that filmed every move of this MAPPA level 3 victim , sadly , ( pause while wiping his eyes ) , GEOamey Custody Services appear to have ' mislaid ' all the footage . "" "" It is also quite irrelevant so , hurry up on your way , its late on a Friday afternoon and I am already late , a majority verdict will do and dont worry about Maurice calling for Gareth , the doctor and another ,,,, its all far too late "" Hang on a moment , did n't this same judge insist the main witness , the doctor , give evidence for me but only through a court lawyer ? Yes , of course , his 22nd February 2012 Crown Court Order , part of my defence evidence stuffed up my rectum , in order to get it into court . Now , as I remember it , this judge also appointed a special Cardiff Cabal lawyer , under rule 39 of the Youth and Justice Criminal Evidence Act 1999 , anything to block any possiblility of evidence coming out and that I may not have ' significant brain damage ' or ' possible brain tumour ' after all . But what is this , both doctor and appointed lawyer fail to attend court ..... "" oh , what can be done ? "" "" Oh , I am all undone , I am in fear and shaking in my shoes , of the meer rumour of this last act of treachery must cause , being mis understood by Jo Public as being an unfair trial . Just what will it do to the name of Cardiff law courts ..... oh , perish the thought I wonder if Enyd Blyton could have made up this sort of stuff ? Must look into serialising these proceedings , some time , to rival some TV soap . His Honour Judge Curran has , understandably , rejected my 1 st Judicial Review Application , ' on paper ' , on the premise that it is ' not clear ' as to my reasoning behind my grievance , in being convicted of so serious offence , during my absence . The police , once again , are reliant on false forensic evidence supplied by Derrick Hassan of the Cardiff Crown Court and a doctor to obtain yet another prolonged incarceration without a proper trial . Court record will disclose that the District Judge , Bodfan Jenkins , presiding at last August Cardiff magistrates hearing , had not even been given my correspondence regarding my right , under statute law , to apply for a re opening of the case . He was also never made aware of the full circumstances on the bizarre incident , involving alleged prohibited weapons in my possession , including a ' walking stick shot gun ' , being the real reason for the summary conviction and £ 50 fine . [ This startlingly acknowledgement by the police , of finding a real prohibited weapon , contrary to Section 5 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the 1968 Fire Arms Act 1966 , at my home , right in the middle of my January 2009 ' WW1 Lewis machine gun ' trial , was completely hushed up and only surfaced before the very same District Judge , Mr Bodfan Jenkins , this March , in one of my many private prosecutions , due to someone's stupidity letting it slip through their own safety net ] . This one caused the destruction of my family life , at 8am on 22nd June 2009 , using twenty five coppers + , followed by my nearly eight months in jail as an innocent man , but who 's counting ? This one , with a rogue doctor , both on the purse strings of lots of charity cash , in South Wales ...... but that is another story to those with the bottle This one personally arranged to have me struck off as a veterinary surgeon , using countless spurious convictions from a thoroughly corrupt Cardiff judicial system ... but this is only the tip of the iceberg *** , My friends know where you live This same argument or the use of Section 36 YJCEA , anything to suppress the truth , is just what District Judge Berg , on 2 nd November 10 common assault conviction , applied when expediting it in meer nana seconds during my forced absence , due to ill health due to unnecessary analgesic medication . This appeal is now in Bristol having been transferred from Wales due to its potentially embarrassing outcome . If only a litigant in person in Cardiff could just have sight of public court records , when only reserved for the legal profession , we need not shout blackmail so often . Exposure , of course , of what really is going on in our courts , if further public records were to be disclosed to the public , would , for example , be like what happened following the prison hospital emergency , needing seventeen prison officers to extricate me . Out of the prison for a day , in cuffs , I get sight of what was written on court record , my ' Remand Warrant ' indicating clearly what lay behind the judiciary's next move . Apart from quick sight of my custody record and remnants of my exalted status amongst the inmates of a category level C parochial prison , during my 2009 stay , as MAPPA level3 , the words , ' extremely dangerous ' remained . Both court and custody documents , seen by myself , during the material times of all these JRs , currently before His Honour Judge Curran , Mr Justice Singh , record I have ' mental health issues ' clearly written with ' significant brain damage ' written . This immediately brings into doubt my level of capacity in the past three years court appearances , exceeding well over one hundred , known by the prosecution throughout . This hand written note , on the Remand Warrant , no doubt , was by the clerk of the court and / or signed by the very District Judge first implementing a Section 36 , without giving reason and then sitting in judgment . As for the so called ' served ' Restraining Order neither the original nor certified true copy we will ever see because it now helps identify the author of it and true recipient for my term of imprisonment . This 2010 ' common assault ' conviction , on appeal in Bristol , will prove even more interesting , following my most recent attempts at the steps of Cardiff Crown Court to lodge my paper , as it is so devoid of ' magistrates record ' , the recent letters from the court clerk effectively stating , ' in your dreams , Maurice ' , no records for you . So why does this latest JR refusal , ' on paper ' , accompany a copy of the Cardiff Crown court log of my 1 st / 2 nd March 2012 Harassment Appeal , when for years now I have always been refused of such public record ? If you are eligible for legal aid then , of course , your designated lawyer can see them , at tax payer's expence , for as long as he likes and even give them to you , if he so pleases . The reality of this is , of course , is quite unrealistic , if nefarious schemes are afoot as he or she is an ' officer of the court ' and therefore making it impossible to remain impartial . Statute law dictates that a ' litigant in person ' ( LiP ) may , if he is so lucky , obtain disclosure of a clerk of the court's notes , both contemporaneous and later records , such as , in this case , written record of the allegation ( s ) facing the accused . The court is only obliged to release a certificate of conviction . These next two ladies outside the RCJ have spent much of their lives , fighting for justice , mutilated by this gross injustice of failed disclosure of court documents I have received no copy of whatever was first before the August Magistrate , what was charge was changed , in my absence or copy of the CPS legal argument that went on with the court without me . This had followed the duty solicitor's hurried visit to my cell , that summer's day , advising me to plead ' not guilty ' as it had been arranged for the case to be dropped if I did . Why was so serious a charge dropped ? Because I had just served new statements , from a Lincolnshire airfield , of eye witnesses over the police re painted ' machine gun ' , spent still more hours before with the station's inspector while copious complaint was again being taken down , re the Cardiff IPPC office refusing , since 2009 , to properly investigate : 1 . the Polices policy to having me shot 2 . falsifying critical evidence in their disastrous ' machine gun ' case , painting of the ' gun ' twice , making it serviceable , all to fool a jury 3 . changing the sex of ' Foxy ' , their undercover agent , that had to give evidence 4 . their continuing harassment of me , around the UK , by the use of falsified two year old psychiatric evidence Today , as in the recent ' Restraining Order ' jury trial and their written notes to the judge , I am still without the public record of either of these cases ! Court record , regarding the Lord Mayor Cardiff to be shot , are being withheld for the purpose of my being sectioned , again , under the 1983 Mental Health Act , but this time for life . South Wales Police almost achieved it in 2009 and with co-operation from the Tottenham police , during the ' Nigerian Musa seven snatched children affair ' , in court NOW at Wood Green Crown Court , London . This time the same MAPPA police intend finding the ' elusive second doctor ' , needed by statute , to sign me away , IPP , to Broadmoor . The purpose of my JR Application is clearly in the interest of the general public , not just for my liberty , safety and family concerns . The next presiding judge , I humbly submit , is required to consider the consequences should this need to go to the Court of Appeal happen and where Article 6 and its supposed safeguards will again be challenged as being needed even more in our current political climate . My recent interviews , with my ' straw poll ' sample taken from within the walls of Cardiff Prison , proved disturbing to say the least . Invariably , both remand and convicted prisoners do not even see the paper work identifying as why they are in prison ! Yes , many neither care nor enquire ; the place is a ' holiday camp ' with no real purpose , so why rock the boat ? If I could have found another LiP , out of the hundred or so prisoners on my wing , I may have established if I was the only one , in the prison , with that special piece of paper , a ' Remand Warrant ' . It was signed by the court giving authority to allow the HM Governor to lock me up . Where His Honour and or the next judge will be concerned will rest on the veracity of those in ultimate control , the guards who guard the guardians , for without proper disclosure there will be yet another fine example of a travesty of justice in a Cardiff court room . Photo of my leaving Cardiff Magistrates , in hand cuffs , by narked South Wales Police , on 1st December 2011 , with no knowledge of any existance of a ' restraining order but beaten up by GEOamey Custodial Services just minutes before . all caught on video the judge , Mr Curran , refused to be made shown to the 4th May12 jury in Cardiff Crown Court . AGAINST CONVICTION 1 . His Honour Judge Curran ought to have recused himself from presiding over the trial of the Appellant as he had previously stayed the Appellant's application to the Cardiff Administrative Court for Judicial Review of the Appellant's appeal at Cardiff Crown Court , Case A20110290 , on 1 st March 2012 and his conviction and sentance of harassment , contrary to the Section 2 of Protection from Harassment Act 1997 , at Cardiff Magistrates Court , on 1st December 2011 , the subject of the Restraining Order allegedly breached in this present case . 2 . Whilst accepting that the issues of fact in the trial were for the jury , His Honour Judge Curran made a number of rulings that erred in law similar if not identical to those by both District Judge John Charles , at Cardiff Magistrates and his Honour Judge PD Hughes QC , in its appeal , at Cardiff Crown Court . 3 . Subsequently , failed disclosure of evidence , by way of court and custody documents and cctv footage , all under the control of the South Wales Police , caused the Appellant , in each of these court cases , compounded the reasons for refusal of access to his own legal papers in both court and prison and be given any facilities , at all , to either interview or call his own witnesses . 4 . All prosecution witnesses , in the two previous above mentioned trials , were prevented from being cross examined by the Claimant while the main witness , a doctor , in the jury trial , subject to this appeal , was denied the Claimant's required examination or cross examination , contrary to His Honour Judge Curran QC's 22 nd February 2012 Court Order . 5 . This was further compounded following , first by the failure to attend of the court instructed barrister , to cross examine the witness ( es ) ' on the Appellant's behalf ' , under Section 36 of Youth and Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 and following His Honour Judge Hugh Davies QC's April 2012 Court Order that caused this main prosecution witness to be removed from the witness list , as irrelevant and so facilitate the Appellant's immediate release from prison . 6 . For the prosecution barrister , on 2 nd May 2012 , to then open the prosecution's case by stating , before the jury and the trial judge , that the South Wales Police had ' just decided ' not to now call the doctor to give evidence , was nothing short of a criminal offence . 7 . For the Appellant then not to be allowed to call this already empanelled prosecution witness , being ' anybody's property ' , as his psychiatrist , expert witness and / or witness of fact and / or as his character witness , was a further abuse . 8 . Before His Honour Judge Hugh Davies QC the prosecution had admitted it was only by the citing of this same witness , in all these three hearings , 2009 WW1Machine Gun trial and numerously related other summary hearings , by the South Wales Police , that the Crown Prosecution Service had been able to be successful , for the South Wales Police , to oppose the Appellant's preparation of both his civil and criminal cases , against the Chief Constable , out of custody , since 8am 22 nd June 2009 . 9 . By April 2012 the Appellant had almost served the pre arranged prison sentence of nine months , in any event , when bail would have been granted , by His Honour Judge Hugh Davies QC , had the Appellant been so stupidly minded as to apply . 10 . There was a "" real possibility "" of actual and / or perceived bias , as a result of His Honour Judge Curran presiding over the Appellant's trial , when the learned Judge had already stayed the Appellant's application for permission to apply for Judicial Review of the dismissal of his appeal against conviction , on 2 March 2012 , relating to the conviction in respect of which the Restraining Order , imposed by Cardiff Magistrates ' , which was alleged to have been now breached . 11 . The certificate of conviction , at last released to the Appellant by HM Court and Tribunals Service , states the 1 st or 9 th December 2011 dated Restraining Order was dependent upon the conviction for a breach in Section 2 of the said Act but Prosecution Exhibit 1 indicates the ' served order ' on the Appellant was that from a Section 4 Restraining Order dated 8 th December 2011 . 12 . His Honour's failure to conduct a ' Vue de Justice ' with the jury , following the custody officers in the both courts , employed by GEOamey Custody Services Ltd , confiscation of the Appellant's scale drawings of the Cardiff magistrates custody suite , where the alleged offence took place was an abuse in law . 13 . His Honour's failure to grant an adjournment for medical attention or even access to his medication in the cells below , following GEOamey Custody Services' vicious assaults upon the Appellant , both on 1 st December 2011 and 4 th April 2012 , was an abuse of process . 14 . His Honour's failure to allow the Appellant sight of all the prosecution exhibits , eg website blog of 4 th December 2011 on http://www.kirkflyingvet.com/ , on arrest , before caution and / or during the trial and sight of various jury ' notes ' , passed to His Honour , following the Appellant's suggestion , in the course of the trial , was also wrong in law . 15 . His Honour's failure to ever allow the Appellant sight of the original or sight of a certified true copy , of the Restraining Order , allegedly served on him , was also wrong in law . 16 . His Honour's failure to order HM Prison , Cardiff to release the Appellant's legal papers and posted in court exhibits by his Mackenzie Friend , allow him proper access to facilities , in order to conduct is defence did nothing but to compound his difficulties and were further breaches in his rights under the Rule of Law . 17 . In the alternative , at the appropriate time , His Honour failed to properly consider granting bail , out of custody , in the light of these apparent extreme and unusual circumstances , unable to find local legal representation , as was indicated by His Honour Judge Hugh Davies QC , on 7 th April 2012 , in Cardiff Crown Court and by His Honour Judge Lambert in Bristol Crown Court , during an apparent application for bail well outside South Wales . 18 . The Appellant therefore had an unfair trial and / or the said trial took place in breach of article 6 ( 1 ) of the ECHR as incorporated by schedule 1 of the Human Rights Act 1998 . 1 . Mr. David Gareth Evans of counsel ought not to have prosecuted the case against the Appellant as he was a potential prosecution or defence witness relating to the drawing up and purported ' service of a ' Restraining Order ' signed ? by District Judge Charles at Cardiff Magistrates' Court on 1 st December 2011 . 2 . An approach by the Appellant's Mackenzie Friend caused the CPS barrister to produce another version of Prosecution Exhibit One , ' Restraining Order ' , not date stamped by the court . Prosecution Exhibit One included the court date stamp 9 th Dec 2011 . 3 . The prosecution barrister admitted , before the jury , a ' draught ' Restraining Order did still exist and was ordered to produce it , by the following day , by His Honour Judge John Curran . 4 . There was discussion , quite wrongly before the jury , as to whether Mr. Evans would be called as a witness relating to the ' drawing up ' of the ' Restraining Order and he indicated to His Honour Judge Curran that he would have to "" seek advice from his professional body the Bar Council for England and Wales "" . 5 . The court heard no more so the Appellant called him as a defence witness and was refused . 6 . The Appellant was refused an adjournment in the light of late prosecution disclosure of relevant evidence germane to the original 1 st December 2011 conviction , upon which the Restraining Order relied . 7 . Further evidence to support , unavailable in the time frame available , was the ' contemporaneous note ' made by the Appellant's solicitor of his client's memory of events on the 1 st December 2011 , on 22 nd December2011 , just two days before the Appellant's arrest and subsequent incarceration . 8 . HM Cardiff prison's governors denied the Appellant proper client / solicitor / witness access , his access to his own funds for the defence or provide proper service of his letters / faxes / e-mails and telephone calls , to and from his solicitor , helpers or proposed witnesses controlled by MAPPA . 9 . An issue had therefore arisen in the case as to what documents were allegedly served on the Appellant relating to the Restraining Order and as to whether one had been served as handwritten by District Judge Charles as there had been evidence adduced before the jury by way of unsworn submissions by Mr. Evans and by sworn evidence from those in the public gallery , that the former had handed up a draft of the proposed Restraining Order to District Charles for approval and that District Charles had written comments on it in order stating he withed to make the Restraining Order stronger ( change to a Section 4 Order , ' fear of violence ' ) . 10 . There was a "" real possibility "" of actual and / or perceived bias as a result of Mr. Evans prosecuting the case , when he had made oral submissions to His Honour Judge Curran which were in effect the giving of evidence which was unsworn and in respect of which the Appellant was unable to challenge by way of cross-examine . 11 . In fact the Appellant had been absent in the cells at Cardiff Magistrates' Court when the issue of the ' Restraining Order ' had been discussed by Mr. Evans with District Judge Charles on 1 st December 2011 . 12 . In addition , the relevant exchanges between Mr. Evans as prosecutor and His Honour Judge Curran were heard in the presence of the jury when they should have been ordered to retire , causing prejudice and bias in the Appellant's case . The jury specifically asked for sight of the original , not copy , of both the GEOamey Custodial Services custody and clerk of the court's log and contemporaneous notes of evidence but the judge indicated , in the absence of the Appellant , that they were not relevant . LACK OF DISCLOSURE IN RESPECT OF THE APPELLANT 1 . The prosecution failed to supply to the Appellant the complete log with handwritten notes and annotations of the custody records and cctv footage , kept by GEOamey Custodial Services , that had been in charge of security in the cells at Cardiff Magistrates' Court and also the notes made by Mr. Michael Williams , the Clerk of the Court and others at Cardiff Magistrates' Court . 2 . Further , it emerged on 3 May 2012 , during the trial that Mr. Evans was appearing in for the prosecution , he had handed up a draft of the ' Restraining Order ' to District Judge Charles on 1 st December 2011 and the learned District Judge had made handwritten additions to it with suggestions for making it stronger to be one under Section 4 of the Act . 3 . There was an issue in the trial as to exactly which version of the ' Restraining Order ' had actually been served on the Appellant in the cells by the Security Officer Mr. Leigh Barker and so the existence of the copy of the ' Restraining Order ' with the handwritten additions made by District Judge Charles became an issue as the Appellant wished the jury to see it . 4 . At the conclusion of the proceedings , on 3 May 2012 , His Honour Judge Curran enquired as to the whereabouts of the version of the Restraining Order with the handwritten additional made by District Judge Charles and was told by Mr. Evans that it was at the CPS Headquarters in the Appellant's case file at Merthyr Tydfil . 5 . Although His Honour Judge Curran directed that it be produced at the resumption of the proceedings , on 4 May 2012 , only a computer print out of the amended restraining Order was produced and the jury was deprived of seeing either the original version with the handwritten additions , made by District Judge Charles or a certified true copy of the original 1 st December 2011 Restraining Order made on some date between 1 st and 9 th December 2011 . 6 . The Appellant had also again sought disclosure of the notes made by Mr. Michael Williams , the Clerk of the Court at Cardiff Magistrates' Court at the commencement of the proceedings , on 4 May 2012 but no order or any determination was made by His Honour Judge Curran for their production , instead , in the absence of the Appellant , informing the jury they , along with the prison and GEOmey Custodial Services records were not relevant . 7 . Prior to trial His Honour knew the Appellant had received correspondence from Cardiff Magistrates stating he was not entitled to any court record other than the certificate of conviction for this and some currently seven ongoing summary cases , different but all related to this current appeal . CASE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM CONSIDERATION BY THE JURY 1 . Although the Appellant did n't make any submissions of ' no case to answer ' , after the close of the prosecution's case , His Honour Judge Curran should have withdrawn the case from the jury on the grounds that the evidence as it then stood , relating to the alleged service of the Restraining Order on the Appellant in the cell number three of Cardiff Magistrates' Court , on 1 st December 2011 , was so unreliable that no jury properly directed could convict on that evidence . 2 . Conflicting evidence had been given between the Clerk of the Court , Mr. Michael Williams and the Security Officer , Mr. Leigh Barker as to whether the Appellant had been serviced in one of the cells or in the corridor of the cell area below the Magistrates , whether he had been served with one or two separate documents , if at all and when put alongside their original but conflicting police witness statements , it is the Appellant's submission , that for this case to have even reached a jury was an abuse of process fueled by vengeance . 3 . In addition , Mr. Barker had given evidence that he had read "" Restraining Order "" at the top of the document , that he had stated in evidence he had given to the Appellant but did n't give any evidence that the Appellant's name was on the document or that he had read the Appellant's name on the document in question . 4 . There was a serious risk of doubt regarding the alleged service of the ' Restraining Order ' on the Appellant in the cell area of Cardiff Magistrates' Court by Mr. Barker on the Appellant . 5 . In the premises , the Appellant's conviction is thereby rendered "" unsafe "" under section 2 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 . South Wales Police are currently in the lime light , following the Swansea police corruption trial and numerous other revelations so it is of no surprise the St Mellons , Cardiff base of the IPCC have put both multiple complaints from me and my family on the back burner . In the light of my complaints , since 2009 , to the IPCC and my long terms remanded in custody , with little or no activity so far identified on your part , in these investigations , I wondered if I might ask you to clarify as to just what progress , if at all , has been so far occasioned in this scandalous affair . I have now obtained copy from the Crown Prosecution Service ( Cardiff ) , with a witness actually writing the colour was ' silver ' and yet this was never raised at the trial . Why not ? How do you account for that or is this a matter of complaint to ' HM Partnership ' and Her Majesty's Prerogative ? Just who , in the Principality , guards the guardian ? I intend going to High Grove with yet another letter of complaint . http://kirkflyingvet.com/photos/around_the_world/HRH-Undelivered-Letter.aspx I returned to Wickenby , Lincolnshire airfield , last week only to find no investigation started , no witness contacted , more eye witnesses found to the fact that the ' gun ' was bought from me as painted black all over . When seized by the police , a year later , it was now with a silver painted ammunition magazine . You refuse to return a copy of my statement or a walking stick shot gun found in the search of my home . In August 2009 South Wales Police , three of them , then returned to Wickenby , with it , less magazine , for further prosecution statements . Police had unblocked it to fire a live round , but admitted obtaining a statement that witnesses saw it painted silver by the new owner immediately after purchase from me . The ' gun ' next appeared in my January 2010 Cardiff Crown Court trial painted ' all black , ' to match the photos and videos off my 2008 website , http://www.kirkflyingvet.com/ even with its ammunition clearly visible ! My younger daughter helped me draw out a route of some 2000 miles the gun may have travelled , during your colleagues' planned conspiracy to pervert the course of justice but there remain gaps , as the jury noticed , of just who , when and where this item went , whilst inside the boundaries of South Wales ? The ' gun ' was returned after my acquittal , painted silver again , not even in matching paint ? How ? Inspector 317 of the Lincolnshire police expressed amazement that this enquiry is not being conducted by way of a ' managed ' IPCC investigation from head office , in Manchester , England , instead of some back street office in Cardiff and under your control , a fellow member of South Wales Police force . This was the continuing saga on how the HM Court Service ( Wales ) , over these past twenty years , are determined to block my appeals , in either civil or criminal proceedings , from ever being aired in an English court room . In this particular case , before Bristol Crown , was , you may think , the simple delivery of appeal documents at Cardiff Crown Court over a ' Contempt of Court ' conviction , now two years ago , my having already served its prison sentence . Procedure dictated that it was to be forwarded by Cardiff Crown Court to the Criminal Court of Appeal , in the Royal Courts of Justice , London . It was a dispute over Cardiff's Recorder , His Honour Judge Nicholas Cooke QC and his pointless Court Order in that it would ' obtain ' the medical evidence I so needed in order to stop severe pain by getting a long overdue total hip replacement operation . Well , today , the appeal against ' common assault conviction ' was adjourned , in order I find a ' defence lawyer ' . If that failed it was for HM Partnership , including the worried Cardiff Crown Court staff , to apply for a Section 36 and so chose one of their own to be ' cross examined ' by ! Incestuous is n't it when you think that this very same Cardiff court officer , who had originally refused to accept my Criminal Court of Appeal papers , by pushing me down the stairs , causing the re breaking of my leg , may also now be protected , again , from my long awaited cross examination should this English court also succumb to contagion or infection . This is a further indictment of the true state of our legal system , in Wales , with the English judge noting the alleged ' common assault ' , on appeal , was committed as far back as July 2009 . The conviction was obtained by trickery , in my absence , in November 2010 and was only finally completed in December 2011 , by District Judge John Charles having milked its consequences to extreme , with a ' no penalty ' . Easy , by ' carte blanche ' application of Section 36 of the Youth and Justice Criminal Evidence Act 1999 , in order to protect their ' Cardiff Cabal ' and their ' gravy train ' , anything to stop the basic right of a defendant cross examining the prosecution witnesses to obtain the truth . By August 2010 District Judge John Charles openly started this , their latest scam of denying all witnesses . It had been implemented , quietly , for many years on LiPs in Wales and spectacularly , of late , applied part way through the January 2010 ' WW1 machine gun ' trial , with the jury's mind made up by the end of the first day . Judge Nicholas Cooke QC , that June , during the ' Contempt of Court ' debacle , had also denied me eye witnesses , access to my own medical records , anything to black mail me to employ one of their own . By Charles instructing a lawyer from Newport to cross examine , using nana seconds of court time , he obtained the criminal conviction they all wanted . Well , not quite as it sounds , maybe , as I was not even there but Ihad been excused by court order , later backed by still more specialist medical reports , from both France and England . The Newport lawyer did attend but cross examined no one , as was the case with the District Judge . Wow , they thought , what a great new way to stitch up Maurice from now on ! By September 2011 Charles had applied this 2 nd November 2010 summary conviction to lock me up for three months , pending still further conspiracies by South Wales Police , anything to prejudice my long outstanding civil damages claims . Incidentally , this District Judge stated I had failed to attend that previous year's hearing there by compounding yet another conviction , one of failure to attend ' he preferring to ignore his original reasoning for a Section 36 . A conveniently placed ' Harassment ' conviction , on the old theme , was again under his control , carrying the statutory sentence of 18 weeks , by statute , again equal to my remand time to the day of conviction . Oh how convenient . So who was surprised in that after the barrister , David Gareth Evans , had slipped in , at the very last moment , the needed extra ' posted letter ' incident to comply with statute to obtain a prison term in the first place ! My throwing this 7 th allegation , served on the day of trial , on the floor of the court had its desired effect . It was noted in the official court record and even The Glamorgan Gem newspaper , for the already drafted appeal . And abuse of Section 35 in this next case ? Yes , you guessed it ; Charles refused me any cross examination again but this time by employing a lawyer from Swansea not forgetting , this time , the man was only answerable to the court and NOT to the Defendant . He was therefore ordered to at least ' go through the motions ' of ' cross examining ' . He asked both irrelevant questions and avoided the obvious ones . He , in fact , challenged no prosecution evidence what so ever , clearly caught on tape , the transcript of which is being published later . This lawyer was last seen running , with his quick £ 1 , 200 attendance fee tucked in his belt , for his Swansea train knowing , full well , much more was due now he had proved his allegiance . Ah , no , I forget . He did come back , did n't he ? Back to repeat the performance at the March 2012 Crown Court hearing , for my appeal before His Honour Judge PD Hughes QC . Again I was denied legal papers , witnesses etc. 2011 Christmas Eve was marked by my being jailed yet again , on the old theme , this time until mid May 2012 , for an alleged ' Breach of a Restraining Order ' never served on me until pushed under a police cell door after my arrest . A nine month prison sentence had been arranged , this time , well in advance , with the usual release from custody to be on the predicted last day of trial . Continuing this Section 36 abuse , however , was to be varied and worked on with much aplomb , as this next case had a lay jury with which to contend . A most unpredictable ' creature ' in this day and age of fast changing habits and social standards . Basing the prosecution's usual strategy , on the general public's apparent fear of those employed in any court building , the judge and prosecution barrister arranged , therefore , the production only of court officials and policemen to give relevant evidence to obtain a conviction . This jury and others , no doubt , risk the huge assumption that court clerks and custody officers , as employees from within a court building are to be trusted . Having stupidly replaced properly trained prison officers to do the job we now have too many ' bully boys ' with little training , little regard for the seriousness of their work that that seriously influence proceedings . It may well have been the reason for the jury's majority verdict . That was a foregone conclusion , to me , once I was allowed no legal papers in court or facilities to interview my witnesses . My websites may well give world wide exposure on just how Cardiff 's so called ' great and the good ' continue to conspire to pervert the course of justice but while the police or judges continue to closing them down others will follow . Soon , I warn you , we will be far too many to jail at any one time . A sample of what the jury may not have known about this case ( to be later expanded in links etc ) . Much needed reforms , anticipated in our judicial system , need to be considered alongside the following : I was again to be blocked from cross examining their key prosecution witness , by application of Section 36 YJCEA 1999 but allowed , at last , to cross examine others . So what is this evil lot up to this time ? The surprising CPS barrister's opening speech , late removal of a key witness and frank admission he , as Her Majesty's Crown Court representative , should not be conducting the case , he being called as a defence witness , was but part of this pitiful story . The Section 36 ' court appointed lawyer ' , to ' cross examine ' , had failed to attend despite a string of albeit clandestine but publicly recorded Crown and Cardiff Magistrate Court hearings and Orders on the matter . One was amongst the defence evidence gently secreted just anterior to my anterior anal sphincter , ready for disclosure , hopefully from a great height . HM Cardiff prison , GEOamey Custody Services and His Honour Judge John Curran QC , had refused either my legal papers or medication being in the court . To a casual observer in the public gallery , for what was the usually concocted Cardiff cabal conspiracy , this now having the potential of something similar to a Whitehall Theatre farce . For the jury to be refused , despite asking by ' jury notes ' , to see what record both court and custody services are kept , of a service of a court document , I have all seen before . So what other exhibits would the jury ' not be allowed to examine ' if I bothered to give evidence , called witnesses and obtained the cctv ? Court cases are usually won or lost , in Cardiff , based on who has the most deceitful lawyer on their side . Successful withholding of evidence , failed ' disclosure ' , is the name of the game . The veracity and mental state of presiding judge , prosecutor and or South Wales Police invariably influences the final outcome . To even contemplate prosecuting Cardiff's court , prison or police services , for civil damages , a jury trial , for example , has to first ' collapse ' , be ' withdrawn part heard ' by the CPS ' or ' be stopped ' by the presiding judge . Above all , the Defendant must never , except in rare occasion , call defence evidence if he thinks he , his family or even his long suffering friends in the public gallery , will ever get reimbursed , following acquittal , of even their bus fares . CPS barrister David Gareth Evans to then go on and admit that , yes , I had been handed a piece of paper in my cell , on 1 st December 2011 , by their star lying witness , Geoamey Custody Services manager , Leigh Barker and yes , containing District Judge John Charles ' very own ink from his fountain pen scribbled through three lines of CPS type , should of also of stopped this trial ' dead in its tracks ' . Approx copy of notes taken by Defendant's solicitor before jury trial Restraining Order - Not in Court CPS came into cell - handwritten an ( d ) print 2 / 3 lines . Refused to leave prison until given something in writing - and was then out . Went to Court and asked for copy of what convicted for . Also contacted Crown - who had file . Inc. "" derogatory "" The CPS barrister then went on to admit , Oh yes , that piece of scribbled on paper was initially sent down for Mr Kirk's ' approval ' , to draught an order and that it had been ' left behind ' in his Merthyr Tydfil office . This was all sparked off in court by my McKenzie Friend , Mr Merion Bowen , forcing the CPS to even disclose still further yet undisclosed documents ! These other drafts were uncovered in the face of the court and still the judge did not stop the trial knowing , full well , I had written for them many weeks before . If that was not enough , to stop proceedings , this issue was compounded , yet again , by the judge now actually pretending to order the disclosure of ' District Judge John Charles' hand written note to me , a small matter I had been asking for , for months , along with the overhead cctv , capturing the lot , with both custody and court contemporaneous record that MUST GO BEFORE THE JURY . Even the visiting solicitor to the prison , before the jury trial took place , took contemporaneous note of all this gross irregularity and e-mailed me his typed record . His quiet ' negotiations ' with CPS have , so far , failed to materialise the sensible way forward for all involved . Further ' Grounds of Appeal ' papers , to the London , must go via Cardiff court within the next few days . But I have to personally deliver them to Cardiff Crown Court , possibly to Derrick Hassan again ! Consider , please , the extreme lengths to which I , one of many , have again been subjected , just to obtain both court and custody contemporaneous record for an already bemused jury . Then consider the reason for recent hunger strike , due to the appalling lack of medical services by HMP and NHS ( Wales ) , as original medical records , originally falsified for MAPPA and a string of Cardiff judges to get me IPP , in 2009 , have still not been corrected nor clarified . How many times has my lawyer written to the authorities now ? Five times ? The need to stuff defence exhibits up orifices , just to get them into court and again be subjected to being beaten up in the Cardiff prison , by the very same bully boys , 395 Myers and 344 Graham , upon my return from court , is all part of their 20 year conspiracy . Masonic devil worship ? Of course it all is while those in ' authority ' , able to stamp it out , are , of course , in the very same club . All this is exactly as to what happened in the 2009 ' machine gun ' , MAPPA and 20011 ' harassment ' court cases , all displaying extreme examples of criminal conduct by the very same faceless individuals from within the Welsh Authorities protected by HM . Extended terms of custody , each time , expecting their irritation will eventually go away , has been a particularly bad error on their part and something they are , shortly , to regret . The prison , now , will not release my legal papers needed for my appeal and JR Application to the Royal Courts of Justice . His Honour Judge Lambert , in Bristol Crown Court this , week , has ordered proper disclosure to show why the 2 nd Nov 2010 ' common assault ' conviction , at last on appeal , is listed outside Wales ? Why in my absence I was convicted of failing to attend when John Charles gave the permission ? Can this English judge also influence a Welsh prison , I wonder ? I will write to Bristol Crown Court and apply for an Order to amend the never seen yet original ' Restraining Order ' to allow me to communicate with witnesses from the public gallery for grounds for Royal Courts of Justice . When I do get promise of court records HM prison Cardiff , Geo Amy Custody Services or some Cardiff judge simply reverse their previous decisions and block their release . This time all three blocked their release after the trial had started . Judge Cullen QC repeatedly witheld what he knew , stifling evidence what the jury needed and even before the trial started , promised me both legal representation and production of the essential witness with his relevant NHS documents . The judge had no intention what so ever of ever upholding those previous court orders and ran Janet Kirk and other helpers a merry dance when they tried to get hard copy from the public counter . He knew that had the JR been successful , I was refused court documents , witnesses , access to lawyer , my own legal papers or right to cross examine in both courts . If current IPCC and NHS ' investigations ' from England had been allowed to be concluded , properly , there would not have been any trial in the first place . NHS officials or their legal representatives , crowded into each and every court room during these past seven months to monitor proceedings ........ so what are they frightenend of ? In Cardiff Crown Court , incidentally , I never ever did get to see any certified true copy of an original document relied on by the prosecution . What utter nonsense again , the ' machine gun ' case all over again . David Gareth Evans , barrister for the Crown Prosecution Service , meaning the representative of Her Majesty the Queen , was no better as he also was promised immunity to criminal prosecution as part of HM Partnership . Now , he perverted the course of justice ' big time ' knowing he is cocooned in their cosy ' Cardiff Law ' . He was free to re draft as many versions of allegations , he liked , during the magistrates nonsense and in full view of the K Team , created the very exhibit that made him , of course , the vital witness to scrap the trial . Instead , the one of many draughts , the one I only saw , was left in the CPS Merthyr Tydfil Office , under lock and key . District Judge John Charles blocked my being able to cross examine anyone , at all , as far back as August 2010 . He had taken a leaf from His Honour Judge Paul Thomas QC's book , during the scandalous 2010 ' machine gun case ' , to prevent the uncovering of the south Wales Police's MAPPA conspiracy Barrister Evans told the court he had contacted the Bar Council for help when realising I was obviously calling him as my main defence witness . As the original fabricator of some fictitiously served up paperwork , down in the cells and by post , what was he doing now conducting the prosecution in the first place . The judge , mean time , sat very quiet knowing if I had objected a re trial would have me returned to prison for many more months whilst unconvicted . On the 3rd day of this circus , Geo Amy either refused to inform the judge the CPS Evans was my defence witness , now to be called , as His Honour had already blocked all others or maybe , custody staff , Diane or Jackie did get my message to court from the cells , below ? This continuing NHS ( Wales ) withholding of my medical records , with evidence recorded of ' significant brain damage ' and a possible tumour , whilst at the same time , refusing me clarification , correction or giving me treatment , is a stark warning to others that these recent criminal proceedings , in Cardiff , have now set a precedent across the UK . 1 . Police found a walking stick shot gun , contrary to Section 5 of the 1968 Fire Arms Act and machine gun ammunition , but never mentioned it in the ' 2010 machine gun court case ' now . I wonder why ? 2 . Serious assault by Geo Amy and nothing is done about it .... see ' gallery ' . 3 . David Gareth Evans , CPS barrister , performs the classic fraudulent manoevre , had it not been done in a Cardiff court , on a par with his predecessor , CPS barrister , Richard Tohmlow , who , in 2009 , had tried to get me sectioned to Ashworth , for life . THANK YOU , FRIENDS and HELPERS WORLDWIDE ! I now risk being either jailed again or quietly eliminated , anything to stop my further exposing the wickedness within the South Wales Police and Cardiff's judiciary . I 've actually seen it in the Royal Courts of Justice , too : the Judge allows for contact with the prisoner , but the staff "" looking after "" the prisoner follow somebody else 's rule . Yesterday , the judge allowed the supporters to visit Maurice in the cells . But when they arrived there , they were told that he had already left which , unfortunately , was not true ! ... Go figure : innocent until proven guilty , fair trial or "" Cardiff Law "" : make it up as you go , as long as Maurice is treated as badly as possibly possible - by virtually anybody who has the capacity to abuse their power ... Thank you for your email of 17 March asking for information about prison conditions for litigants . As your request does not fall within the terms of the Freedom of Information Act it has been dealt with it as a Treat Official enquiry and as such I have responded accordingly . I have answered each of your questions below in he order they appear : 1 . With regard the position / recognition of McKenzie friends and the Prison Service , there is no individual or specific Prison Service Order ( PSO ) or Prison Service Instruction ( PSI ) which covers this particular subject but if in connection to an adjudication guidance can be found in the Prison Discipline Procedures PSI – PSI 47 / 2011 at paragraphs 2.10 t o 2.15 under Tarrant Principles . If the matter does relate to an adjudication , the guidance states that at the start of every hearing , the adjudicator must ask the prisoner whether s / he wishes to have additional assistance and , if the prisoner expresses interest , must explain about the possibilities of legal representation , legal advice , or of assistance from a friend or adviser , also known as a McKenzie friend . Requests for legal representation , legal advice or a McKenzie friend may also be made during the adjudication . McKenzie friends may ask for arrangements to be made before the hearing for access to various facilities in order to help the accused prepare the case . However , and as may be apparent from the above , a McKenzie friend can not act as a legal representative in the same way as an appointed solicitor or barrister and therefore they do not attract the special privileges of things such as Rule 39 or legal visits . This means that in terms of visiting arrangements the format would be a matter for local discretion and in relation to documentation passed between the prisoner and their McKenzie friend these would not attract the confidential privilege attached to Rule 39 unless they had originated from a solicitor or barrister or the Courts . 2 . The decision to use the services of Emailaprisoner.com is at the sole discretion of individual Governors / Directors and there is no central directive from NOMS Headquarters that it should be made available across the prison estate . 3 . While it is perceived that the cost of prisoners' calls is relatively high this must be reflected in the fact that the telephone system ( PINphone system ) available to prisoners is viewed as a "" private network "" and the cost of calls are not currently linked to public call rates . This is because the public payphone service does not require the same level of investment as the prison PINphone system which must operate safely and securely within the prison setting . Furthermore , to reduce costs under the current contract would require a large subsidy at public expense . The PINphone system is a unique service designed to ensure safe and secure access to telephones for prisoners . 4 . Postal orders are not the only way in which monies can be sent into prisoners . NOMS policy is set out in Paragraph 15.10.2 of Prison Service Instruction 26 / 2011 , NOMS Finance Manual , this recommends that monies sent in by post should be by cheque or postal order to safeguard the sender and the recipient , but establishments can not refuse to accept cash . 5 . Litigant in Persons who are on remand are not afforded any different provisions with regard the PINphone system as convicted prisoners . However , where there are any urgent legal or compassionate circumstances , such as imminent court proceedings or a domestic crisis , Governors / Directors have the discretion to allow such calls to take place at public expense . Before agreeing to such , it must be confirmed that this need could not be met by means of a visit or letter and that the individual had insufficient credit within their PINphone account to make the call . As stated these calls will be made at public expense and such calls can be made either via an official telephone or a generic PINphone account with pre-funded credit paid for by public funds . Furthermore , while the PINphone system does not accept incoming calls , arrangements can be made to allow prisoners to exceptionally receive calls on official telephones from official bodies or the Courts . However , this would again be at the Governors discretion . Unconvicted prisoners are statutorily entitled to send two free letters every week and the cost of postage will be paid for by the local prison ( normally sent at the 2nd Class rate of postage ) . They are also entitled to a Special Letter on top of their statutory entitlement if in exceptional circumstances and this would include in connection with their defence . They can send as many privilege letters ( ones which are paid for by the prisoner ) as they wish and are allowed to send over and above their statutory entitlement of letters . The policy which covers the above guidance can be found in PSI 49 / 2011 Prisoner Communications Services . 6 . Prisoners who demonstrate that without IT there is a real risk of prejudice to their legal proceedings are issued with IT . The Governor / Director must be convinced that the prisoner's access to justice will genuinely be hampered without appropriate IT . The overriding purpose is not to provide equipment simply to make the manipulation of material easier or to facilitate swifter communications , but to prevent the impediment of access to legal documentation that might otherwise result if the equipment is not made available . For example , a piece of prosecution evidence might only be available in digital format or be so unwieldy in paper format as to be impractical and it might therefore disadvantage the prisoner if the necessary facilities were not provided . Ideally , the prisoner's solicitor would make arrangements to bring such a piece of evidence to a legal visit to enable the client to view it and then take it away again , although if the prisoner is conducting their own defence it does not follow that IT must be provided for the duration of the case - it might only be needed to view that one piece of evidence and so should be withdrawn as soon as is practicable afterwards . Governors / Directors must balance the prisoner's need against the serious threat that IT presents to security in prisons and where access is permitted must ensure that there are procedures and technical fixes in place to prevent misuse such as illicit access to the internet and the downloading / sharing of material that might endanger or cause distress to the public , staff and other prisoners , or otherwise undermine confidence in National Offender Management Service / Ministry of Justice ."	1
1526	"These were outbursts of anger and even hatred towards the police . If any part of the post-Tottenham riots had political content , this was it . A routine check The knee-jerk political responses to the England riots distracted parliament and the public from a key issue which that girl from Peckham understood : the significant and sustained misuse of police powers . In the week of the riots , when Tory MPs variously demanded that rioters be detained in Wembley stadium , sprayed with indelible chemical dye , water-cannoned and tear-gassed , former minister Peter Lilley demanded that the government stick to its plans to cut police budgets . Based on my own and my family's experiences I suggest cuts to bureaucracy would not – in Peter Lilley's words – "" make the police more efficient "" but instead would lead to further abuses of power by the state , abuses which ultimately endanger all civil rights . Stop and Search : A case study in vindictive policing As a black man born and bred in London , I have never been stopped and searched by the police . Perhaps it is because I look like and am a computer geek , I do n't know . However my younger brother Gus has been stopped and searched countless times . For months on end , he was subjected to sustained police harassment . It started in 2001 , when he was 14 years old . Wimbledon's Criminal Investigations Department ( CID ) came to our home and charged him with robbery . Gus admitted taking a school friend's house keys after an argument and explained that he had tried to give them back . The police gave him a final caution and warned him that next time he 'd be going to court . After that , Gus was frequently stopped and searched in the Mitcham and Colliers Wood area of South London . He would complain to my mother that he wanted our family to leave the area as he hated it , but nobody took his allegations seriously . A few weeks after the robbery accusation , Gus was with friends on his way to school when plain-clothes police officers arrested him alone for ' causing an affray ' . The Magistrates Court threw out the case due to the officers' unreliable testimony , calling the charges spurious . It got worse . Gus said he could identify which cars were following him but I dismissed that as paranoia . He told me that once police driving a car spotted him on a bus , flagged it down , marched him off and then searched him in the road . He hated walking the streets alone , knowing that he would be subjected to a "" routine check "" , as illustrated by this rap song by British duo , The Mitchell Brothers . This became a regular ritual of aggression and shame . It was n't just because he was black , it developed into a personal vendetta . Six weeks after the farce at the Magistrates Court , my brother and his friends were walking home from a local youth club when police sirens and lights headed towards them . "" They are coming for me "" , he said . His friends laughed and joked in disbelief , but he was proved right . Gus was charged for robbery of an off-duty police officer's chequebook . As he was forcefully handcuffed on the floor , his friends attacked the police car in outrage and retaliation ; two of his peers were arrested but later one was released without charge and the other was subsequently charged alongside my brother . The allegation was that Gus , with two other boys , had pounced on an off-duty police officer at night and stolen the officer's chequebook . The police kept my brother overnight in South Norwood Police Station where , he claims , two police officers punched him in the head , directing blows at the temples and at the back . ( We later understood that this was to avoid visible bruising ) . This happened a few days after his 15th birthday . The following morning , when my mother was on her way to collect him , Wimbledon police came to our home to search for the "" officer's missing chequebook "" . My grandmother and my youngest brothers ( then aged 6 and 7 ) were present and the youngest even had a pleasant chat with one of the officers while our house was being turned upside down . The chequebook was n't found but the police still pursued the charge of theft to the Magistrates Court . Gus and a friend were convicted of robbery but Gus's conviction was overturned on appeal , as it came out in the Crown Court that his alibi – he said he was in the youth club – was corroborated by youth workers and the youth club register . My mother got support from the local MP , Siobhan McDonagh , who told Wimbledon police that she would help our family sue for them for harassment . After McDonagh's intervention – and only after that – we received a written apology from a chief constable , and the campaign of harassment ended for Gus . Is this a tragic , isolated case ? I can not produce concrete evidence that on dropped or acquitted charges , black family homes are more likely to be searched than those belonging to white or other ethnic groups . However , let 's look at the context : people of African descent are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched in the UK than white people . The day after the Tottenham riots , thirty South London leaders of Ashanti , a Ghanaian ethnic group , held their bi-monthly meeting . Every parent who attended reported that at least one of their children had suffered sustained harassment by the Metropolitan Police . It was always between the ages of 13 and 17 . This is the experience of just one of many African and African-Caribbean communities in the UK . Rather than upholding the law , some elements of the Metropolitan Police across London are misusing their powers for extra-judicial punishment meted out to those they happen to despise . Stop and search is a pernicious power . The received view is that it is used by the police in too blanket a fashion , and by indiscriminately selecting entire groups – young men with hoods , young blacks – causes generalised grievance . My experience is that the police use the power in a discriminating and selective fashion , singling out individuals they decide to ' get ' and then getting them . This is not just a race issue but also a class issue . When David Starkey claimed the whites had become black , he was referring to white working class children adopting popular black youth culture . His racist claims ( i.e. evil black youth corrupting previously innocent whites ) , allude to a experiential truth : that many white working class youths of Nottingham , Manchester and Liverpool suffer similar abuses of police power and thus express similar anger towards the police . What is wrong and what must be done The Tottenham and subsequent riots must be seen in the context of the death of Mark Duggan , the Met's 320th death in police contact since 1990 . The riots were fuelled by the perception and experience by some communities of persistent discriminative police brutality . The Scarman Report of 1981 was supposed to resolve this and now in 2011 , the same issues are being repeated . The police are now allowed to arrest based on race . How did we get here again ? The New Labour era ushered in performance targets . Funding for police constabularies was contingent on meeting these targets set by Whitehall , and this filtered down into a perception of police officers having to make a certain number of arrests each year in order or face punishment . This was especially true in Merton , the borough my family still live in , where in 2007 , one officer was being threatened with action for failing to achieve three arrests in 15 weeks . Policing was turned on its head : crime prevention was no longer a priority – the police now relied on crime to save their own jobs . This perverse incentive combined with tabloid hysteria ( "" feral hoodies "" , "" chav scum "" ) and institutional racism , creating a climate of hostility towards young people who hung around street corners listening to grime and hip hop . After the terrorist attacks on 7th July bombings , New Labour also brought in special anti-terrorism laws . David Davis , former shadow Conservative Home Secretary , recently remarked that "" not one of its 100,000 stop and searches under the Terrorism Act had led to a terror-related arrest "" , let alone a conviction . When the coalition government came to power , Theresa May rightly called for an end to the target culture and has scrapped performance targets in policing . May also pledged to scrap unnecessary paperwork . In February this year Parliament approved alarming reductions in the information recorded on stop and search which , according to the Runnymede trust , "" will now make it impossible to measure repeat stops and harassment ; the effectiveness of a stop and search ; and any misuse of force . "" What 's more , said the Trust , "" police will no long be required to record the use of ' stop and account ' , which will make it impossible to determine if stop powers are being used proportionately and remove local community scrutiny of stop practices . "" This drive to cut bureaucracy conveniently forgets that much of it provides a necessary check on those officers inclined to misuse their powers . It is particularly troubling at a time when the Prime Minister has sanctioned the use of rubber bullets and water cannons and declares that our "" human rights culture "" is a problem . 1 . Stop police cuts to enable local police transparency : Ensure a minimum ratio of back office staff to police officers / activity . Local police constabularies must publish online police activity / arrests maps alongside already existing online local crime maps . They should detail aggregate non-identifying information such as postcodes and wards that have had stop-and-account and warrant searches , and this should be traced to conviction rates . 2 . Scrap Sus , anti-protest and other illiberal laws : Abolish stop-and-search , the SOCPA Act of 2005 , remove the ability to create non-protest zones , repeal the parts of the Counter Terrorist Act which criminalises photographing the police . Remove provisions in the current Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill , which allow police constables the power to confiscate personal property in Parliament Square . 3 . Demilitarise the police : Ban the use of tasers , rubber bullets and water cannons . Reinstate the division between arrestable and non-arrestable offences . Abolish the Territorial Support Group . 4 . Reform the IPCC : All IPCC investigations should be public unless requested by the complainant . Make the IPCC commissioners directly elected , not appointed by the Home Secretary , with powers of recall initiated through a process that involves complainants creating a petition . Enact the proposals made by INQUEST's Response To IPCC Stock Take Consultation 2008 . The way things are now , the police do not act as a public service for all . For many they are a brutal , malicious force who use their powers in both arbitrary and despotic ways , punishing individuals without due process . As such they are , as we can see , intensely resented not just by the individuals who directly experience this but also by their relatives , friends and contacts who live in fear of the police , a classic and familiar consequence of despotism . It is certainly a very long way from policing by consent ."	0

241	"Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development Seventh session Geneva , 24-28 February 2003 Item 6 of the provisional agenda progress report on the implementation of the agreed conclusions and recommendations of the commission at its sixth session , including post-doha follow-up Prepared by the UNCTAD secretariat Executive summary The note on "" Improving the functioning and the structure of the intergovernmental machinery of UNCTAD "" ( TD / B / EX ( 24 ) / L. 1 ) , re-endorsed by the Trade and Development Board at its twenty-sixth executive session on 10 April 2001 , stated inter alia : "" Starting with the second session of each Commission , the fifth day of the session will be used for policy reviews of implementation by member States and the secretariat of the outcome of previous sessions , on the basis of documentation produced by the secretariat "" . Accordingly , the secretariat has prepared the present report , which contains information on the implementation of agreed conclusions and recommendations adopted at the sixth session of the Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development and addressed to UNCTAD . The report covers three areas : electronic commerce and international transport services , competitiveness of SMEs and gender . The section on international transport services and electronic commerce highlights best practices in these interrelated fields for enhancing the competitiveness of developing countries . The section on competitiveness of SMEs takes a closer look at financial innovations for improving SME access to finance , including e-finance . The section on gender looks at mainstreaming gender in order to promote opportunities . The report deals also with the implications for the work of the Commission following the Doha Ministerial Meeting . Electronic commerce and international transport services : Best practices for enhancing the competitiveness of developing countries 3 Improving the competitiveness of SMEs in developing countries : Role of finance , including e-finance , to enhance enterprise development 6 Mainstreaming gender in order to promote opportunities 10 Implications for the work of the Commission following the Doha Ministerial Meeting 13 The report of the Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development on its sixth session ( TD / B / COM . 3 / 46 ) contained a number of recommendations for action by UNCTAD . It also included agreed conclusions on the implications for the work of the Commission following the Doha Ministerial Meeting . These recommendations and agreed conclusions are set out below , together with the relevant action taken so far . Following the recommendations of the Commission at its fifth session , the secretariat undertook a series of actions . Recommendation UNCTAD should keep under review and monitor developments relating to economic , commercial , legal and infrastructure aspects of electronic commerce affecting international transport services , and analyse the implications thereof for developing countries , and furthermore collect and disseminate this information to member countries . Action The secretariat continued monitoring and analysing developments at the international level relating to economic , commercial and legal aspects of electronic commerce having a particular impact on international transport services , and disseminated the information to member countries through its recurrent publications such as the Review of Maritime Transport and the Transport Newsletter . In addition , information was disseminated through presentations at various regional and national seminars . One of the most important developments concerning legal aspects of electronic commerce is the on-going work in the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ( UNCITRAL ) on the preparation of a new draft international instrument on transport law , which was reported in the Review of Maritime Transport 2002 . The draft instrument envisages the use of "" electronic record "" as well as paper transport documents and grants equal legal status to electronic communications as paper documents . The draft is still in its preliminary stages and if / when agreement on a new international instrument is reached it will provide an important step in removing legal barriers to further development of international transport . The UNCTAD secretariat is continuing to make a major substantive contribution to the work carried out under the auspices of UNCITRAL . In particular , it has provided a detailed analytical commentary on the draft , which is published by UNCITRAL as one of the two working documents of its Working Group ( A / CN . 9 / WG . III / WP . 21 / Add . 1 ; UNCTAD / SDTE / TLB / 4 ) . Recommendation UNCTAD should undertake studies on the use of traditional transport documents in international trade , particularly the extent to which negotiable bills of lading are necessary for modern-day international trade , and the extent to which they can be replaced by non-negotiable transport documents , such as sea waybills , and by electronic alternatives . Action In order to implement this recommendation the secretariat is in the process of conducting a study concerning the use of various transport documents , including negotiable and non-negotiable documents as well as electronic alternatives . To that end , a questionnaire has been widely distributed to interested parties involved in international trade and transport , including providers and users of transport , intermediaries , banks , insurers and members of the legal profession . The replies received will be reflected in a report , which will be submitted to the Commission at its next session and will also be fed into ongoing discussions at the international level aimed at preparing the necessary framework conditions for paperless trading . Recommendation UNCTAD should develop and deliver training materials , where appropriate , and disseminate information on best practices in the field of electronic commerce and international transport services for developing countries in cooperation with relevant public and private sector organizations . Action In the context of the TrainForTrade regional project "" Capacity building in the fields of transport and international trade "" ( RAF / 99 / A09 ) , the secretariat has prepared a course on multimodal transport and logistics . This course covers various elements related to electronic commerce and international transport services . In particular , it contains a module on logistics that emphasizes the essential role of information in the context of freight transport management . New challenges are described , highlighting that proper cargo tracking is a prerequisite for efficient and secure cargo movement . The module introduces the basic features of logistics system management . It refers to the use of new technologies such as electronic data interchange , the Internet and modern operational planning techniques applied in supply-chain management . It shows that information management is becoming an essential part of any industrial development . The International Institute for the Management of Logistics ( IML ) of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) developed this module on logistics and one IML academic staff member participated in the first delivery of the course in Bamako ( June 2001 ) . This contribution is the first demonstration of the commitment made by the EPFL during the Transport Session of the Third United Nations Conferences on the Least Developed Countries ( Brussels , May 2001 ) . The EPFL had offered to contribute to transport management training for LDCs through special programmes , scholarships and dedicated research on topics proposed by LDCs ( See A / CONF . 191 / 13 , P. 84 ) . In order to implement this recommendation the secretariat contacted a number of port authorities with experience in setting up electronic platforms to exchange data between members of the port community belonging to the public and private sectors . APEC , the training institution of the Antwerp Port Authority , hosted a two-day session in late March 2002 for a number of port experts to prepare an outline for a course on Information and communications technology in port communities . Experts from Indonesia and Spain complemented expertise from the port of Antwerp and the neighbouring port of Ghent . Two members of the UNCTAD secretariat also contributed to the session . The secretariat has continued with the next phase of the procedure for course development in collaboration with the port of Valencia ( Spain ) , which has features in common with those found in ports of developing countries . Information on best practices in electronic commerce and international transport services has been disseminated through UNCTAD's recurrent publications , such as the E-commerce and Development Report and the Transport Newsletter . The importance of logistics for order fulfilment is discussed in chapter 8 of the E-commerce and Development Report . The development of Internet-based portals for shipping services , the use of mobile phones for transmitting SMS messages regarding vessel arrival and for trucking operators , and the use of an e-mart to reduce repositioning costs of empty containers are some of the developments discussed in the Transport Newsletter . Recommendation UNCTAD should prepare guidelines for the establishment of model port community systems and logistics platforms in developing countries . Action The secretariat analysed a number of port community systems and is in the process of preparing preliminary guidelines based on its findings . A port community system is one that allows the electronic exchange of information amongst the port community . This implies that the port community must have the capability to send , receive and process information electronically . Most of the port community systems have been developed and are operated by an independent organization specifically established for this purpose by the port community . In general , users pay an annual subscription fee plus a charge for each transaction . The core function of the system is to allow the exchange of information by EDIFACT or XML messages . Some systems maintain data files such as dangerous cargo lists . The port authority has been one of the key players . In Singapore , the community system has been developed and is operated by a fully owned subsidiary of PSA Corporation ; it focuses on services provided by the port as well as exchanging messages within the community . One of the most important actors in the community is the customs administration , as it controls the release of goods . Most community systems have been developed to interface with customs systems that imply that customs have a computerized system . UNCTAD's technical cooperation work in customs reform is creating the capacity in customs administrations to exchange information electronically with the port community and thus facilitate the development of port community systems . IMPROVING THE COMPETITIVENESS OF SMEs IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES : ROLE OF FINANCE , INCLUDING E-FINANCE , TO ENHANCE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT Recommendation UNCTAD should , through its Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting , complete its work on a user-friendly accounting framework for small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) that will allow them to produce transparent , reliable and uniform financial and business information , and report back to the Commission as soon as possible . Action Since the last session of the Commission , the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting has completed drafting its guidelines for accounting by SMEs . It deliberated on the proposed guidelines at its nineteenth session , held in Geneva from 25 to 27 September 2002 . The final guidelines are expected to be issued in the near future once wider consultation on the drafts has been completed . Recommendation UNCTAD should strengthen its technical corporation programmes for entrepreneurship , including where appropriate in cooperation with the International Trade Centre in order to improve meaningfully the creditworthiness of SMEs by linking its business development services to financial services through partnerships between national programmes such as the Entrepreneurship Development Programme ( EMPRETEC ) and banks . Action During 2002 , UNCTAD responded to requests by countries for assistance in improving SME access to finance , including by combining financial services with business services . After the relevant stakeholders in the SME and financial communities had been interviewed , workshops were held or planned to permit a public-private sector dialogue on how market failure could be resolved . In the case of Uganda these activities resulted in the establishment of a plan of action and a task force headed by the Ugandan Bankers Association and the Bank of Uganda . A set of recommendations was sent to the Minister of Finance , Planning and Economic Development for immediate action . It is expected that Enterprise Uganda ( EMPRETEC ) , as a member of the task force , will pursue the idea of concluding partnerships with various banks , assisting them in identifying creditworthy SMEs . A request from the Romanian Minister for SMEs made possible an initial assessment of the situation of SMEs and the willingness of the banking community to service them . The European Commission will also begin to assist in facilitating SME access to finance . At the EMPRETEC Directors Meeting , held from 9 to 11 October 2002 , a session was devoted to experiences combining financial and non-financial services . EMPRETEC Ghana is the most advanced , with six different initiatives . Given the complex nature of these initiatives , it has decided to create a finance company - the EMPRETEC Finance Company - to manage them and is seeking a licence . Recommendation UNCTAD should monitor the development of new products and innovative financial mechanisms pertinent to the EMPRETEC programme so that participants can more easily access them , including environmentally and socially responsible investment funds . Action During 2002 , UNCTAD continued its research on best practices in financial innovations for SMEs , focusing more on mechanisms to finance technology . The results of this work are contained in the issues note "" Financing technology for SMEs "" and the background paper "" Providing finance for technology-based SMEs "" . For example , SMEloan Hong Kong ( China ) has introduced new appraisal and monitoring methods for lending based on information that is relatively easily obtained from SMEs , such as who their customers are , how much business they do and how much cash they will collect . The SMEloan model analyses the triangular relationship between cash flows , sales and accounts receivable . It uses the Internet to obtain cash flow information on a real-time basis , thus reducing loan-servicing tasks and costs . The Expert Meeting on Improving the Competitiveness of SMEs through Enhancing Productive Capacity : Financing Technology was held from 28 to 30 October 2002 . The experts considered national policies and programmes in both the public and private sectors to finance the technology that SMEs need in order to compete in the global economy . EMPRETEC Ghana has developed a number of services to facilitate access to finance . Its most profitable service is training bank loan officers how to evaluate SME risks . It also has a $ 700 , 000 revolving loan programme funded by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) that does not require collateral . It started a mutual loan guarantee association ( MEGA ) with donor assistance support whereby Empretecos in the scheme can borrow up to six times what they have deposited with the bank . EMPRETEC is managing part of the national export development investment fund , thereby facilitating SMEs' participation in it . It has signed a memorandum of understanding with a leasing company whereby it submits applications , provides consultancy services to those SMEs selected and receives a percentage of the leasing fee in return . It has set up credit sourcing services in four of its regional centres to assist Empretecos ; this lowers interest rates and increases loan maturities over what SMEs could obtain on their own . Another example is the EMPRETEC centre in Colombia , which has an agreement with the national credit guarantee agency whereby it certifies EMPRETEC business plans . When submitted to the participating banks , these business plans are accepted as the 80 per cent collateral requirement . Recommendation UNCTAD should continue its work on business linkages , including interfirm cooperation and partnerships , as one of the most efficient ways to access finance , technology , skills and markets . Actions UNCTAD has elaborated a project proposal to assist Governments that wish to start or strengthen linkage programmes in their countries . It consists of policy advice and capacity building so that SMEs are partnership-ready . It also describes the most effective mentoring and coaching programmes that would have to be put in place by the large enterprises . On the basis of this proposal , Uganda has obtained donor funding to start a pilot programme in 2003 . In addition , a linkage component was added to the women entrepreneurs programme , funding for which was provided by the German Government at the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries . UNCTAD also assisted Sebrae in organizing a roundtable on business linkages during the Inter-American Development Bank's Micro Forum in Brazil , which was attended by over 3,000 SMEs , government officials and support agencies . The roundtable featured presentations by transnational corporations ( TNCs ) on their linkage programmes ; during the roundtable they committed themselves to working with Brazilian chief executive officers to help them design similar programmes . Lastly , as a follow-up to the World Investment Report 2001 , which featured linkage programmes in 14 countries , a video was produced on best practices in Penang , Malaysia . The purpose of the video is to demonstrate to the public and private sectors exactly how the process works and how to make it most effective in terms of its positive impact on growth , development and competitiveness . The video showcases the roles played by all the partners - Government , SME support agencies and the TNCs themselves . According to the Chief Minister of Penang , such partnerships have been an important component in Malaysia's growth and development . During the annual meeting of the World Association of SMEs in Changzhou , China , held from 19 to 21 September 2002 , a member of the secretariat chaired a panel session and made a presentation on business linkages . The Committee of Donor Agencies for SME Development took up the topic of best practices in business linkages at its annual meeting in Turin , Italy from 16 to 18 September 2002 . It decided to form a small working group headed by UNCTAD to discuss guidelines for donor interventions in this field . A number of multilateral and bilateral agencies have started programmes , and there is a huge diversity in the types of activities undertaken and their impacts . At the Symposium on the United Nations Global Compact and Swiss Business , held in Geneva on 29 October 2002 and co-organised by UNCTAD , the United Nations Global Compact Office and the Swiss Government , the issue of linkages was stressed as one important channel through which companies , particularly TNCs , can make a contribution to the development of host countries . During the seminar , which was attended by more than 200 representatives of Swiss business ( mostly SMEs themselves ) , one of the five parallel workshops in the afternoon was specifically dedicated to the subject of linkages . At the meeting of the Investment Advisory Council held in Johannesburg on 31 August 2002 during the World Summit on Sustainable Development , special attention was given to private sector development , especially SMEs . It was acknowledged that SME-TNC linkages could be powerful channels for diffusing knowledge and skills between firms . To achieve these linkages , UNCTAD was encouraged to help SMEs to become partnership-ready through its SME capacity-building programmes . Recommendation UNCTAD should incorporate the aspects of e-finance and e-commerce that are more relevant to the needs of SMEs into UNCTAD technical cooperation activities and ensure coordination and synergies with other international organizations active in this field . Action The results of UNCTAD's research work and papers presented by e-finance experts at UNCTAD events are widely available to users worldwide through the UNCTAD website . Many other international organizations , including development banks , use those materials when organizing their training and other events in cooperation with UNCTAD . In December 2002 the World Bank organized a conference on "" new technologies for small and medium-size enterprise finance "" with the active participation of UNCTAD and with UNCTAD materials providing most of the background reading . Elements of e-finance are increasingly being incorporated into the activities of Trade Points . The Trade Point Programme was officially transferred to the World Trade Point Federation on 4 November 2002 , with UNCTAD still providing support to its secretariat , as well as capacity building for Trade Points . In October 2002 , the Federation signed a partnership agreement with one of the main credit insurance and credit rating providers , Coface . Under this agreement , Coface grants the Federation and its clients access to its international credit rating ( @ rating ) services through the Federation's website . This service aims at building trust in international trade transactions concluded by Trade Point client companies and increasing the international credibility of these companies . UNCTAD's EMPRETEC programme is exploring the possibility of incorporating an e-commerce training module in its menu of products and services , but interest among users is low , as is the case for most SMEs . Recommendation UNCTAD should organize regular forums , including regional seminars and group training , to sensitize Governments , central banks , financial service providers and the corporate sector in developing and transition countries to the advantages of electronic finance at the local , regional and global levels . Action UNCTAD organized a side event entitled "" E-Finance for Development "" in the framework of the International Conference on Financing for Development , convened by the United Nations in Monterrey , Mexico , in March 2002 . This side event was attended by many participants , including representatives of Governments , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and academia . Special e-finance-related sessions were organized at the UNCTAD regional e-commerce workshop in Curaçao , Netherlands Antilles ( June 2002 ) and at the UNCTAD-ESCAP Asia-Pacific regional conference on e-commerce strategies in Bangkok , Thailand ( November 2002 ) . UNCTAD prepared a study entitled "" E-finance for development : Global trends , national experiences and SMEs "" , which was reported at various forums . It became chapter 6 of UNCTAD's E-commerce and Development Report 2002 . The report is posted on the UNCTAD e-commerce website and is expected to be widely used , as the experience with previous reports has proved , by policy makers and business practitioners in developing and transition economies , thus sensitizing them to the importance of the correct policy choices and sequencing , as well as the adoption of best business practices to ensure better SME access to e-finance . Recommendation UNCTAD should encourage Governments , central banks and financial institutions to provide information on e-finance for the purposes of analysis , intergovernmental deliberations and technical cooperation . Action The importance of data on the state of e-finance and the need to undertake capacity building in information gathering and dissemination in that field have been constantly emphasized by UNCTAD publications , as well at the events organized by UNCTAD . Recommendation UNCTAD should mainstream gender in all areas of work , as appropriate . In doing so , a focal point on gender should be identified in each division of UNCTAD , with the responsibility to integrate the gender dimension in all substantive areas of the division , without prejudice to the work of the overall coordination of the focal point on women designated by the Secretary-General . Action Divisional focal points on gender have been nominated in each division of UNCTAD . To ensure that gender mainstreaming goes beyond establishing gender units and gender focal points , the secretariat's follow-up activities have focused on designing , for pilot implementation , capacity-building technical assistance proposals in the areas of gender sensitization for trade policy makers and gender statistics . UNCTAD prepared a background paper for The Least Developed Countries Report 2002 on "" Trade liberalization , gender and rural poverty in African LDCs "" . Its key policy conclusion is that "" rural women will not necessarily benefit from trade liberalization unless there are a range of measures to address the gender-intensified disadvantages and gender-imposed constraints "" . The paper stresses the importance of access to capital in ensuring that women are not excluded from the benefits of economic growth . UNCTAD organized the pre-UNLDC III workshop in Cape Town in March 2001 on "" LDCs : Building capacities to mainstream gender in development strategies "" . Subsequently , UNCTAD with financial support from the Government of Japan and UNDP consolidated all the documentation and the outcome in a publication entitled "" LDCs : Building capacities to mainstream gender in development strategies "" , which was released recently and is being widely distributed . Since one of the major obstacles for rural women in LDCs concerns mobility and lack of access to transport , the secretariat is collaborating with the International Forum on Rural Transport Development in the design and development of a capacity-building technical assistance proposal on "" Making global bicycle markets work for the poor "" to contribute to greater mobility for girls in LDCs . Another example of UNCTAD's work on gender is the close cooperation between the UNCTAD secretariat , which services the Commission on Science and Technology for Development , and the Commission's Gender Advisory Board to ensure that gender remains a cross-cutting issue in the deliberation and outcome of this substantive theme . UNCTAD's Science and Technology for Development Network ( STDev ) ( http://www.unctad.org/stdev ) has also created a space for "" Gender , Science and Technology "" . Here one can find information on the Gender Advisory Board , as well as links to relevant documents on gender . Activities carried out in accordance with more specific recommendations are described below . Recommendation UNCTAD should review its capacity-building programmes , particularly EMPRETEC and MED 2000 , so that they are gender-sensitive and can effectively provide training and advice to improve women entrepreneurs' access to finance , e-finance and e-commerce . Action In the Expert Meeting on Improving the Competitiveness of SMEs in Developing Countries : The Role of Finance , Including E-Finance , to Enhance Enterprise Development "" held in Geneva from 22 to 24 October 2001 , the experts considered the problems faced by women entrepreneurs in obtaining credit and examined successful programmes for improving women's access to finance . They concluded that it is vital to increase the number of women working as advisers and other staff in banks in order to improve banks' awareness of and capability to work with women entrepreneurs . The UNCTAD secretariat has taken the initiative of compiling a database to promote networks of women entrepreneurs and business associations . Moreover , pursuant to paragraph 26 of the "" Report of the Expert Meeting on Mainstreaming Gender in order to Promote Opportunities "" ( TD / B / COM . 3 / 40 ) , a specific training and mentoring programme targeted at women entrepreneurs has been prepared by EMPRETEC El Salvador , with the assistance of EMPRETEC Uruguay , under the supervision of the UNCTAD secretariat . The first workshop for women entrepreneurs took place during the first half of November 2002 . In addition , UNCTAD , together with Enterprise Ethiopia and Enterprise Uganda , launched a project for women entrepreneurs , financed by the Government of Germany , in August 2002 . It seeks to develop gender-sensitive training and business services for women entrepreneurs . It enhances their access to business development services in order to enable them to establish and / or strengthen their SMEs by overcoming obstacles to accessing finance and technology , so that they can survive and compete in increasingly global economies and participate in business linkages with larger companies , for example affiliates of transnational corporations . Recommendation UNCTAD should , in cooperation with the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) , ( i ) carry out analytical and case-study-based work on gender and information and communication technologies ( ICT ) , identifying the specific opportunities in the digital economy for women ; ( ii ) develop sex-disaggregated indicators and contribute to the collection of data on ICT and the telecommunications sector in order to identify the impact of ICT on women and women's impact on ICT ; ( iii ) identify policies for mainstreaming gender in national ICT policy-making , including the telecommunications sector , with a view to enhancing the participation of women in the digital economy and thus contributing towards increasing the competitiveness of developing countries ; and ( iv ) develop recommendations on mainstreaming gender in ICT policy for inclusion in the outcome of the World Summit on the Information Society ( WSIS ) , to be held in Geneva in 2003 and in Tunisia in 2005 . Action UNCTAD has prepared a study entitled "" Gender , E-commerce and development "" , which is included as a chapter in the E-commerce and Development Report 2002 . It outlines different opportunities and challenges which women face in the digital economy . It illustrates how ICT enhance business opportunities for self-employed women in developing countries and how they create new employment in ICT-related services industries . It also discusses the main barriers which women have to overcome in order to benefit fully from the new technologies . The study makes a number of policy recommendations for mainstreaming gender in ICT policy , including in policy areas related to enhancing human capacity and training , improving access to telecommunications infrastructure , new technologies and the Internet , providing finance to SMEs and promoting new business opportunities or employment for women in the ICT sector . UNCTAD secretariat staff meet regularly with staff from the ITU secretariat working on ICT and gender . UNCTAD has participated in Geneva-based events on ICT and gender organized by ITU in preparation for the WSIS , and in this context has provided ITU with inputs to the preparation of recommendations on mainstreaming gender in ICT policy-making . As part of its ongoing work on e-commerce strategies , the UNCTAD secretariat included the topic of gender on the agenda of the Expert Meeting on Electric Commerce Strategies for Development ( held in Geneva from 10 to 12 July 2002 ) and the Asia-Pacific regional conference on e-commerce strategies ( held jointly with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) in Bangkok from 20 to 22 November 2002 ) . Agreed conclusion in the field of trade facilitation With regard to the plan for "" Capacity Building and Technical Cooperation for Developing Countries , especially LDCs , and Economies in Transition in Support of their Participation in the WTO Doha Work Programme "" ( UNCTAD / RMS / TCS / 1 ) , which reflects the specific requirements of the least developed and African countries , the secretariat has initiated a comprehensive work programme in the area of trade facilitation , building on UNCTAD's accumulated experience without negatively affecting its ongoing activities . The work programme would provide , in line with paragraph 27 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration , enhanced technical assistance and capacity building with long-term sustainable impact to further expedite the movement , release and clearance of goods , including goods in transit . This programme would identify the major issues and address policy analysis and development , human resources development and institutional development . It would also identify trade facilitation needs and priorities to allow developing countries to better evaluate the implications of closer multilateral cooperation for their development policies and objectives . Actions Project proposals in the field of trade facilitation In addition to the project proposal included in Part C of document UNCTAD / TCS / RMS / 1 , another project proposal has been prepared for financing by the 4th Tranche of the Development Account . This proposal covers analysis of potential impact of the adoption of binding rules on trade facilitation at WTO . The expected outcome of these projects is to assist in building a consensus among developing countries as to the modalities of future negotiations on trade facilitation rules . The approach underlying these proposals is that the application of international standards for trade facilitation requires tailor-made execution adapted to local frameworks . As opposed to traditional technical assistance based on foreign expertise , long-term capacity building should rely on local and regional know-how . The purpose of this new approach is to guarantee ownership by the beneficiaries and the formation of lasting learning and innovating trade and transport facilitation structures . Local , national and regional facilitation clusters , gathering together private and public sector participants , will be guided to monitor and improve trade and transport corridors , and supply and distribution chains . Capacity building is seen as a multi-layer process , combining institution-building , human resource development and collaborative networks . Extensive use of knowledge management schemes based on ICT is also foreseen where skills can be gained from direct on-the-job learning rather than through individual or group training . The above-mentioned projects will take advantage of the considerable experience accumulated by UNCTAD in trade facilitation through its wide range of analytical work and technical assistance activities that take into account the specificities of developing countries , as well as through the introduction of information technology tools in the areas of cargo tracking ( ACIS ) and customs automation ( ASYCUDA ) . Consensus building The secretariat organized , in November 2002 , an Expert Meeting on Efficient Transportation and Trade Facilitation in the post-Doha context . This meeting was aimed at contributing to a better understanding of current implementation and development issues related to trade facilitation , including security , capacity building and the consequences of the potential adoption of binding rules . Supporting documents for the meeting were prepared . Representatives of the secretariat regularly attend meetings of the WTO's Council for Trade in Goods on trade facilitation , and make adhoc contributions as required ( e . g . the paper on transit issues , presented when Article V ( on freedom of transit ) was discussed ) . In the context of its post-Doha work , taking into account paragraph 27 ( on trade facilitation ) of the Doha Declaration , the secretariat will continue to assist developing countries in identifying their trade facilitation needs and priorities . Training activities The secretariat has undertaken various actions regarding the organization of training activities in the field of trade facilitation . At the request of Austria , a proposal has been formulated to organize - jointly with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) - two workshops ( in Addis Ababa and Ouagadougou ) , plus one high-level meeting ( in Vienna ) , on trade facilitation and trade barriers to trade . For the regional South Asian and Andean Community , a joint proposal has been prepared to hold two workshops covering tariffs and trade facilitation issues . The organization of these workshops has been requested and will be funded by the European Union ( DG Trade ) . In cooperation with ESCAP , a series of seminars on trade facilitation are being designed and will be delivered through the International Institute for Trade and Development in Bangkok . Agreed conclusion in the field of electronic commerce The Commission recognizes the importance of creating and maintaining an environment that is favourable to the future development of electronic commerce , as provided for in paragraph 34 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration . Support is required in order to bridge the digital divide so as to create new opportunities for the expansion of trade . To this end , the Commission stresses the need for strengthened and adequately resourced assistance to respond to those needs , as outlined in document UNCTAD / RMS / TCS / 1 . Actions Expert Meeting UNCTAD held the Expert Meeting on E-Commerce Strategies and Development ( 10-12 July 2002 ) . Up to 100 experts attended the meeting , including many from developing countries and also experts from international organizations such as ITU , the World Bank , the International Labour Organization , UNCITRAL and UNDP , and representatives of G-8's DOT Force and the UN ICT Task Force . The meeting addressed the issue of strategies that developing countries could formulate and implement in order to promote e-commerce and the development of ICT generally . The experiences of developed and developing countries provided the major inputs into the discussion . The focus was on strategies relating to human resources development and training for e-commerce , legal and regulatory issues , and telecommunications , infrastructure and access . The experts recognized that strategies relating to other areas such as e-finance , transport and distribution were equally important . Emphasis was placed on the linkages and interactions between e-commerce strategies and other aspects of national development strategies . Regional seminars on e-commerce Two regional level events were held in 2002 - the High-level Regional Workshop on E-commerce and ICT for Central America and the Caribbean ( Curaçao , 25-27 June ) and the High-level Regional Meeting on E-commerce Strategies for Development , in cooperation with UN / ESCAP ( Bangkok , 20-22 November ) . The two meetings provided an opportunity for ( a ) raising awareness about various aspects of e-commerce and ICT strategies , ( b ) identifying policies and strategies that can create an enabling environment for e-commerce in developing countries , ( c ) supporting national capacity-building in e-strategy making , and ( d ) exchanging information about national and regional experiences regarding e-commerce and ICT . Attention was paid to the issue of developing a participatory approach to national e-commerce strategy making , as well as to regional and global initiatives in support of developing countries . Annual publication The secretariat published its E-commerce and Development Report 2002 . This annual report provides information on major developments in e-commerce of particular interest to developing countries and policy recommendations . It is intended to allow developing countries greater access to knowledge about e-commerce issues and thus contribute to their capacity building and their ability to develop policies and strategies for e-commerce . Other activities The secretariat also carried out other activities , including participating as a member in the UN ICT Task Force and in preparations for the World Summit on the Information Society . Furthermore , it participated in a number of regional and national events in which it provided advisory services in areas such as legal and regulatory issues and e-finance . Agreed conclusion regarding cooperation with international organizations To maximize benefits in the fields of competence of this Commission , UNCTAD is encouraged to continue collaboration with other relevant international organizations , such as the World Trade Organization , the UN regional commissions and specialized institutions , as appropriate . Action The secretariat has been instrumental in the coordination within the UN system in the field of trade facilitation . The High Level Committee on Programmes ( HLCP ) of the UN Executive Board had requested UNCTAD to convene a meeting with a view to identifying trade facilitation issues to be dealt with in a coordinated manner within the agencies members of the HLCP . The meeting took place on 5 April 2002 and resulted in the creation of a cooperative network of multilateral agencies working on trade facilitation issues within the UN system - ILO , the World Trade Organization , the World Bank , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , the International Monetary Fund , UNIDO , the Economic Commission for Europe on behalf of the Regional Commissions , the Chief Executives Board Secretariat and UNCTAD . Work on SME promotion is coordinated in the international community by the Committee of Donor Agencies for SME Development . It met in September 2002 in Turin , Italy . UNCTAD is an active member of this Committee and has driven its work forward in two areas : SME finance and business linkages . UNCTAD is also a member of the Working Group of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on SMEs and participates in it sessions . The Working Group met in December 2002 and is preparing for its ministerial meeting in 2004 . It has two major themes to which UNCTAD is contributing : financing technology and ICT diffusion and use by SMEs .

Nevertheless , there is growing evidence that non-dividing cells that are undergoing differentiation can play a role in determining whether an epidermal tumour will progress or regress . In addition , communication between epidermal cells and cells of the immune system can affect tumour formation . In my talk I will discuss some of the mechanisms by which differentiated cells can influence squamous cell carcinoma formation .	3

USA 2002 Dir George LUCAS ( Year refers to British release ) Running Time : 143 minutes Colour : Deluxe Estimated Attendance : 9.16 million View cast and credits What they said at the time ... Synopsis Padmé Amidala , former queen of the planet Naboo , comes to the city-world of Coruscant to take her seat in the senate of the Republic . She becomes the target of an assassination attempt , and the Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker are assigned to protect her . They track the assassination attempt back to bounty-hunter Jango Fett , and through him to an alliance of commercial interests - perhaps under the control of ' the Dark Side ' - who are seeking to secede from the Republic . Anakin accompanies Padmé back to Naboo where they begin to reveal their feelings for each other . Obi-Wan traces Jango to a forgotten ocean planet called Kamino , where an alien race has been building an army of clone warriors , and then to the barren world Geonosis , where Jango reports to Count Dooku , a powerful Jedi who leads the secession movement . On Coruscant , Chancellor Palpatine is granted emergency powers and decides to use the clone army of Kamino to fight for the Republic . Anakin and Padmé travel to Tatooine , Anakin's home planet , where he finds that his mother has been kidnapped by bandits . He arrives too late to rescue her and massacres her kidnappers indiscriminately . The droid R2-D2 arrives on Tatooine , carrying a distress call from Obi-Wan . Anakin and Padmé ( as well as R2-D2 and its fellow droid C-3PO ) follow him to Geonosis , where they are captured along with Obi-Wan and must battle monstrous beasts in a gladiatorial arena . They are rescued by a band of elite Jedi led by Mace Windu . Led by Yoda , the clone army arrives to defeat Dooku's army of droids in a massive battle . Obi-Wan and Anakin are seriously injured fighting with Dooku . Yoda saves them and drives away Dooku , who escapes to Coruscant and reports to his master , an evil Sith Lord who is well pleased by events . Akanin and Padmé are married . Review At least George Lucas has had the common sense to return the Star Wars saga to its roots : rampant piracy and hysterical pastiche . The ponderous air of Asimovian prologue that made Episode I The Phantom Menace so nearly unendurable has mercifully been abandoned , and the cartoonish characters from that film who struck many viewers ( myself included ) as grossly offensive ethnic stereotypes have been written to the margins but not ( sadly ) banished altogether . What remains is a crisply managed entertainment that moves deftly from one dazzling digital setting to another and lards its story judiciously with well-executed action sequences . If the plots of Lucas' overall narrative ( and of this instalment ) have become baffling and arcane , that 's nothing new to those steeped in Skywalker lore . Fans will surely welcome Episode II Attack of the Clones as a return to form , probably the most agreeable entry in the series since The Empire Strikes Back ( now designated Episode V ) in 1980 . Yet even sympathetic observers can detect a disturbance in the Force , one that can not entirely be blamed on the sinister Count Dooku played by Christopher Lee ( distinguishable only by his wardrobe and accoutrements from Saruman , the good wizard gone bad he plays in The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring ) . A quarter of a century after the first release of Star Wars , Lucas has become like Darth Vader , a prisoner of his own inflated mythopoetics . As the nomenclature of his universe becomes ever more ludicrous and his grand storyline grows in complexity and gaseousness ( "" Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of Naboo "" ) , it increasingly seems that Lucas is a bored god who no longer cares about his creation one way or the other . Episode II Attack of the Clones is more crowded with quotations and references than any previous Lucas film , but it 's hard to say whether they make any kind of point ; there is a compulsive , perhaps desperate quality one never sensed in his earlier work . Here Lucas is not merely imitating himself ( and the original sources he imitated in the first place ) but is imitating his imitators and sometimes imitating films markedly inferior to his own . Much of the appeal of his original 1977 film - the one he now wants us to call Episode IV A New Hope - lay in its wide-eyed mythic shallowness , its catholic embrace of Flash Gordon serials and Westerns and samurai films and the grandiose pulp epics of early science fiction . These were all things Lucas evidently loved , and taken together they defined a worldview that was boyish , idealistic , short on moral subtlety and profoundly American . The sheer density of allusion in Episode II can be thrilling for movie buffs . The cloning station on the ocean planet Kamino comes from Tarkovsky's Solaris , Anakin Skywalker's act of vengeful violence on Tatooine recalls John Ford's The Searchers ( after briefly referring to the biker-film tradition of The Wild Ones and Easy Rider ) , and so on . In the film's major showcase sequences , Lucas jams together disparate elements with mixed results . The exciting spacecraft-chase sequence through the vertiginous spaces of the city-planet Coruscant , in which Obi-Wan Kenobi ( Ewan McGregor ) and Anakin pursue the would-be assassin of Padmé Amidala , emulates the most memorable scene in Luc Besson's ludicrous The Fifth Element while , inevitably , nodding to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and accessing Lucas' own quasi-sexual spaceship-through-a-tight-channel leitmotif . Later , when Obi-Wan , Anakin and Padmé must fight an array of phantasmagoric monsters in a desert amphitheatre , the touchstones seem to be Scott's Gladiator ( and its numerous sword-and-sandal predecessors ) , Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers and the classic 1950s stop-motion animation of Ray Hanyhausen . Of course in any Lucas film ( at least until now ) the director eventually has to deal with actors , and the results in Episode II are no more encouraging than usual . It 's easy to ridicule Lucas for his inability to depict the complexity of adult emotions , but his attempt here to capture the melodrama of teen romance - between Anakin ( Hayden Christensen ) and Padmé ( Natalie Portman ) - would seem chaste and dull by the standards of US network television . This forbidden love is clearly meant to be the emotional core of the entire Star Wars prequel trilogy ( and presumably in Episode III will lead Anakin to renounce his Jedi vow of chastity and embrace the Dark Side ) . But during the love scenes the pell-mell pace screeches to a halt while Portman and Christensen mumble their way dolefully through Lucas' abysmal dialogue against a variety of lovely artificial settings . Those actors who survive a Lucas film with their reputations intact , as Lee , McGregor and Samuel L Jackson do here , plant their feet firmly on the jet-age or Stalinist-chic sets and bellow their lines , Errol Flynn style . Christensen tries to convey Anakin's inner torment with a sort of brooding Brando impersonation , but mainly comes off as a sulky vacuity . When Padmé points out , after his mother's death , that he is n't all-powerful , he pouts : "" Well , I should be ! Someday I will be ! "" In this same scene , Padmé finally admits to Anakin that she loves him , just after he has confessed to her that he has massacred an entire village . Lucas gives no indication that he sees this contrast as grotesque or inappropriate ; indeed , throughout the first two-thirds of this trilogy he seems profoundly uncomfortable with the task of making the cute kid of The Phantom Menace and the dreamboat teen of this film grow into the monstrous tyrant in the impressive black headgear . As derivative space opera goes . Episode II Attack of the Clones is enjoyable enough . But at heart it 's a forgettable and discontented tale of entropy and corruption , of a grand , idealistic venture that has lost its way . It 's no Star Wars .

894	"Silas drew near the man on tiptoe . He lay partly on his back , partly on his side , and his right forearm concealed his face from recognition . Suddenly , while the American was still bending over him , the sleeper removed his arm and opened his eyes , and Silas found himself once more face to face with the loiterer of Box Court . "" Good-night , sir , "" said the man , pleasantly . But Silas was too profoundly moved to find an answer , and regained his room in silence . Towards morning , worn out by apprehension , he fell asleep on his chair , with his head forward on the trunk . In spite of so constrained an attitude and such a grisly pillow , his slumber was sound and prolonged , and he was only awakened at a late hour and by a sharp tapping at the door . He hurried to open , and found the boots without . "" You are the gentleman who called yesterday at Box Court ? "" he asked . Silas , with a quaver , admitted that he had done so . "" Then this note is for you , "" added the servant , proffering a sealed envelope . Silas tore it open , and found inside the words : "" Twelve o ' clock . "" He was punctual to the hour ; the trunk was carried before him by several stout servants ; and he was himself ushered into a room , where a man sat warming himself before the fire with his back towards the door . The sound of so many persons entering and leaving , and the scraping of the trunk as it was deposited upon the bare boards , were alike unable to attract the notice of the occupant ; and Silas stood waiting , in an agony of fear , until he should deign to recognise his presence . Perhaps five minutes had elapsed before the man turned leisurely about , and disclosed the features of Prince Florizel of Bohemia . "" So , sir , "" he said , with great severity , "" this is the manner in which you abuse my politeness . You join yourselves to persons of condition , I perceive , for no other purpose than to escape the consequences of your crimes ; and I can readily understand your embarrassment when I addressed myself to you yesterday . "" "" Indeed , "" cried Silas , "" I am innocent of everything except misfortune . "" And in a hurried voice , and with the greatest ingenuousness , he recounted to the Prince the whole history of his calamity . "" I see I have been mistaken , "" said his Highness , when he had heard him to an end . "" You are no other than a victim , and since I am not to punish you may be sure I shall do my utmost to help . And now , "" he continued , "" to business . Open your box at once , and let me see what it contains . "" Silas changed colour . "" I almost fear to look upon it , "" he exclaimed . "" Nay , "" replied the Prince , "" have you not looked at it already ? This is a form of sentimentality to be resisted . The sight of a sick man , whom we can still help , should appeal more directly to the feelings than that of a dead man who is equally beyond help or harm , love or hatred . Nerve yourself , Mr. Scuddamore , "" and then , seeing that Silas still hesitated , "" I do not desire to give another name to my request , "" he added . The young American awoke as if out of a dream , and with a shiver of repugnance addressed himself to loose the straps and open the lock of the Saratoga trunk . The Prince stood by , watching with a composed countenance and his hands behind his back . The body was quite stiff , and it cost Silas a great effort , both moral and physical , to dislodge it from its position , and discover the face . Prince Florizel started back with an exclamation of painful surprise . "" Alas ! "" he cried , "" you little know , Mr. Scuddamore , what a cruel gift you have brought me . This is a young man of my own suite , the brother of my trusted friend ; and it was upon matters of my own service that he has thus perished at the hands of violent and treacherous men . Poor Geraldine , "" he went on , as if to himself , "" in what words am I to tell you of your brother's fate ? How can I excuse myself in your eyes , or in the eyes of God , for the presumptuous schemes that led him to this bloody and unnatural death ? Ah , Florizel ! Florizel ! when will you learn the discretion that suits mortal life , and be no longer dazzled with the image of power at your disposal ? Power ! "" he cried ; "" who is more powerless ?

780	Molecular and Cellular mechanisms underpinning Vascular Calcification and Angiogenesis Vascular calcification is a common complication of many diseases including atherosclerosis , diabetes , renal disease , hypertension , vein graft failure and calciphylaxis . Recent studies have shown that there is a strong association between the presence of vascular calcification and adverse clinical events such as myocardial infarction and stroke . However , little is known about how the deposition of mineral in vessels is controlled . We have shown that vascular pericytes have multi-lineage potential and can differentiate into osteoblasts and chondrocytes in vitro and in vivo . We have also shown that these cells can deposit a calcified matrix resembling that found in calcified atherosclerotic plaques , suggesting that pericytes may mediate , at least in part , vascular calcification . We have recently demonstrated that several genes that are implicated in the pathological calcification of arteries , namely matrix Gla protein , Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and HtrA1 serine protease are all differentially expressed during pericyte differentiation . We are currently using molecular , cellular and biochemical approaches to elucidate the mechanisms by which each of these proteins regulates calcification . In time , this integrated programme of research will provide important insights into the pathogenesis of vascular calcification and may identify potential targets for the therapeutic manipulation of this event . Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from an existing vascular bed . It is of fundamental importance in many physiological and pathological conditions , including embryonic development , wound healing , atherosclerosis , diabetic retinopathy , psoriasis and tumour growth and metastasis . Angiogenesis is a complex process involving changes in endothelial cell phenotype , extracellular matrix remodelling and stabilisation of the newly formed blood vessels . We are currently employing a multidisciplinary approach to define the roles of specific angiogenic factors and matrix proteins in regulating endothelial cell-pericyte interactions that are crucial for vessel stabilisation . We aim to translate this work into the development of novel anti-angiogenic and pro-angiogenic strategies for the treatment of diseases characterised by abnormal vascularisation .

794	Recent theoretical studies have suggested that the observed suppression of superconductivity in superconductor / ferromagnet ( S / F ) heterostructures could be modulated by controlling the ferromagnetic exchange interaction in the superconductor . The exchange interaction in the superconductor is the sum of the exchange interaction from the ferromagnetic regions , which has a phase and magnitude that depends upon the direction that the ferromagnet is magnetised and the distance . As the exchange interaction has a phase it is possible that the contribution from two regions will cancel out . The exchange interaction , which can be viewed as an imbalance in the spin populations , suppresses superconductivity so any reduction in the exchange interaction will increase the superconducting transition temperature ( Tc ) of the heterostructure . Thus by changing the magnetisation of the ferromagnetic regions it is possible to control the exchange interaction in the superconductor and so the superconducting p. ..	3
70	"Chapter 18 The next day he did not leave the house , and , indeed , spent most of the time in his own room , sick with a wild terror of dying , and yet indifferent to life itself . The consciousness of being hunted , snared , tracked down , had begun to dominate him . If the tapestry did but tremble in the wind , he shook . The dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild regrets . When he closed his eyes , he saw again the sailor's face peering through the mist-stained glass , and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart . But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him . Actual life was chaos , but there was something terribly logical in the imagination . It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin . It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood . In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished , nor the good rewarded . Success was given to the strong , failure thrust upon the weak . That was all . Besides , had any stranger been prowling round the house , he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers . Had any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds , the gardeners would have reported it . Yes , it had been merely fancy . Sibyl Vane's brother had not come back to kill him . He had sailed away in his ship to founder in some winter sea . From him , at any rate , he was safe . Why , the man did not know who he was , could not know who he was . The mask of youth had saved him . And yet if it had been merely an illusion , how terrible it was to think that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms , and give them visible form , and make them move before one ! What sort of life would his be if , day and night , shadows of his crime were to peer at him from silent corners , to mock him from secret places , to whisper in his ear as he sat at the feast , to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep ! As the thought crept through his brain , he grew pale with terror , and the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder . Oh ! in what a wild hour of madness he had killed his friend ! How ghastly the mere memory of the scene ! He saw it all again . Each hideous detail came back to him with added horror . Out of the black cave of time , terrible and swathed in scarlet , rose the image of his sin . When Lord Henry came in at six o ' clock , he found him crying as one whose heart will break . It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out . There was something in the clear , pine-scented air of that winter morning that seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life . But it was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused the change . His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm . With subtle and finely wrought temperaments it is always so . Their strong passions must either bruise or bend . They either slay the man , or themselves die . Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on . The loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude . Besides , he had convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror-stricken imagination , and looked back now on his fears with something of pity and not a little of contempt . After breakfast , he walked with the Duchess for an hour in the garden and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party . The crisp frost lay like salt upon the grass . The sky was an inverted cup of blue metal . A thin film of ice bordered the flat , reed-grown lake . At the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey Clouston , the Duchess's brother , jerking two spent cartridges out of his gun . He jumped from the cart , and having told the groom to take the mare home , made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken and rough undergrowth . "" Have you had good sport , Geoffrey ? "" he asked . "" Not very good , Dorian . I think most of the birds have gone to the open . I dare say it will be better after lunch , when we get to new ground . "" Dorian strolled along by his side . The keen aromatic air , the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood , the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time , and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed , fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom . He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness , by the high indifference of joy . Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front of them , with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it forward , started a hare . It bolted for a thicket of alders . Sir Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder , but there was something in the animal's grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray , and he cried out at once , "" Do n't shoot it , Geoffrey . Let it live . "" "" What nonsense , Dorian ! "" laughed his companion , and as the hare bounded into the thicket , he fired . There were two cries heard , the cry of a hare in pain , which is dreadful , the cry of a man in agony , which is worse . "" Good heavens ! I have hit a beater ! "" exclaimed Sir Geoffrey . "" What an ass the man was to get in front of the guns ! Stop shooting there ! "" he called out at the top of his voice . "" A man is hurt . "" The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand . "" Where , sir ? Where is he ? "" he shouted . At the same time , the firing ceased along the line . "" Here , "" answered Sir Geoffrey angrily , hurrying towards the thicket . "" Why on earth do n't you keep your men back ? Spoiled my shooting for the day . "" Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump , brushing the lithe swinging branches aside . In a few moments they emerged , dragging a body after them into the sunlight . He turned away in horror . It seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went . He heard Sir Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead , and the affirmative answer of the keeper . The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with faces . There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of voices . A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the boughs overhead . After a few moments – that were to him , in his perturbed state , like endless hours of pain – he felt a hand laid on his shoulder . He started and looked round . "" Dorian , "" said Lord Henry , "" I had better tell them that the shooting is stopped for to-day . It would not look well to go on . "" "" I wish it were stopped for ever , Harry , "" he answered bitterly . "" The whole thing is hideous and cruel . Is the man ... ? "" He could not finish the sentence . "" I am afraid so , "" rejoined Lord Henry . "" He got the whole charge of shot in his chest . He must have died almost instantaneously . Come ; let us go home . "" They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly fifty yards without speaking . Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and said , with a heavy sigh , "" It is a bad omen , Harry , a very bad omen . "" "" What is ? "" asked Lord Henry . "" Oh ! this accident , I suppose . My dear fellow , it ca n ' t be helped . It was the man's own fault . Why did he get in front of the guns ? Besides , it is nothing to us . It is rather awkward for Geoffrey , of course . It does not do to pepper beaters . It makes people think that one is a wild shot . And Geoffrey is not ; he shoots very straight . But there is no use talking about the matter . "" Dorian shook his head . "" It is a bad omen , Harry . I feel as if something horrible were going to happen to some of us . To myself , perhaps , "" he added , passing his hand over his eyes , with a gesture of pain . The elder man laughed . "" The only horrible thing in the world is ennui , Dorian . That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness . But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner . I must tell them that the subject is to be tabooed . As for omens , there is no such thing as an omen . Destiny does not send us heralds . She is too wise or too cruel for that . Besides , what on earth could happen to you , Dorian ? You have everything in the world that a man can want . There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you . "" "" There is no one with whom I would not change places , Harry . Do n't laugh like that . I am telling you the truth . The wretched peasant who has just died is better off than I am . I have no terror of death . It is the coming of death that terrifies me . Its monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me . Good heavens ! do n't you see a man moving behind the trees there , watching me , waiting for me ? "" Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand was pointing . "" Yes , "" he said , smiling , "" I see the gardener waiting for you . I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the table to-night . How absurdly nervous you are , my dear fellow ! You must come and see my doctor , when we get back to town . "" Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching . The man touched his hat , glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating manner , and then produced a letter , which he handed to his master . "" Her Grace told me to wait for an answer , "" he murmured . Dorian put the letter into his pocket . "" Tell her Grace that I am coming in , "" he said , coldly . The man turned round and went rapidly in the direction of the house . "" How fond women are of doing dangerous things ! "" laughed Lord Henry . "" It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most . A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on . "" "" How fond you are of saying dangerous things , Harry ! In the present instance , you are quite astray . I like the Duchess very much , but I do n't love her . "" "" And the Duchess loves you very much , but she likes you less , so you are excellently matched . "" "" You are talking scandal , Harry , and there is never any basis for scandal . "" "" The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty , "" said Lord Henry , lighting a cigarette . "" You would sacrifice anybody , Harry , for the sake of an epigram . "" "" The world goes to the altar of its own accord , "" was the answer . "" I wish I could love , "" cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in his voice . "" But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the desire . I am too much concentrated on myself . My own personality has become a burden to me . I want to escape , to go away , to forget . It was silly of me to come down here at all . I think I shall send a wire to Harvey to have the yacht got ready . On a yacht one is safe . "" "" Safe from what , Dorian ? You are in some trouble . Why not tell me what it is ? You know I would help you . "" "" I ca n ' t tell you , Harry , "" he answered sadly . "" And I dare say it is only a fancy of mine . This unfortunate accident has upset me . I have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me . "" "" What nonsense ! "" "" I hope it is , but I ca n ' t help feeling it . Ah ! here is the Duchess , looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown . You see we have come back , Duchess . "" "" I have heard all about it , Mr. Gray , "" she answered . "" Poor Geoffrey is terribly upset . And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare . How curious ! "" "" Yes , it was very curious . I do n't know what made me say it . Some whim , I suppose . It looked the loveliest of little live things . But I am sorry they told you about the man . It is a hideous subject . "" "" It is an annoying subject , "" broke in Lord Henry . "" It has no psychological value at all . Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on purpose , how interesting he would be ! I should like to know some one who had committed a real murder . "" "" How horrid of you , Harry ! "" cried the Duchess . "" Is n't it , Mr. Gray ? Harry , Mr. Gray is ill again . He is going to faint . "" Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled . "" It is nothing , Duchess , "" he murmured ; "" my nerves are dreadfully out of order . That is all . I am afraid I walked too far this morning . I did n't hear what Harry said . Was it very bad ? You must tell me some other time . I think I must go and lie down . You will excuse me , wo n ' t you ? "" They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the conservatory on to the terrace . As the glass door closed behind Dorian , Lord Henry turned and looked at the Duchess with his slumberous eyes . "" Are you very much in love with him ? "" he asked . She did not answer for some time , but stood gazing at the landscape . "" I wish I knew , "" she said at last . He shook his head . "" Knowledge would be fatal . It is the uncertainty that charms one . A mist makes things wonderful . "" "" One may lose one's way . "" "" All ways end at the same point , my dear Gladys . "" "" What is that ? "" "" Disillusion . "" "" It was my début in life , "" she sighed . "" It came to you crowned . "" "" I am tired of strawberry leaves . "" "" They become you . "" "" Only in public . "" "" You would miss them , "" said Lord Henry . "" I will not part with a petal . "" "" Monmouth has ears . "" "" Old age is dull of hearing . "" "" Has he never been jealous ? "" "" I wish he had been . "" He glanced about as if in search of something . "" What are you looking for ? "" she inquired . "" The button from your foil , "" he answered . "" You have dropped it . "" She laughed . "" I have still the mask . "" "" It makes your eyes lovelier , "" was his reply . She laughed again . Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet fruit . Upstairs , in his own room , Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa , with terror in every tingling fibre of his body . Life had suddenly become too hideous a burden for him to bear . The dreadful death of the unlucky beater , shot in the thicket like a wild animal , had seemed to him to pre-figure death for himself also . He had nearly swooned at what Lord Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting . At five o ' clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to pack his things for the night-express to town , and to have the brougham at the door by eight-thirty . He was determined not to sleep another night at Selby Royal . It was an ill-omened place . Death walked there in the sunlight . The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood . Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry , telling him that he was going up to town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in his absence . As he was putting it into the envelope , a knock came to the door , and his valet informed him that the head-keeper wished to see him . He frowned and bit his lip . "" Send him in , "" he muttered , after some moments' hesitation . As soon as the man entered , Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a drawer and spread it out before him . "" I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this morning , Thornton ? "" he said , taking up a pen . "" Yes , sir , "" answered the gamekeeper . "" Was the poor fellow married ? Had he any people dependent on him ? "" asked Dorian , looking bored . "" If so , I should not like them to be left in want , and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary . "" "" We do n't know who he is , sir . That is what I took the liberty of coming to you about . "" "" Do n't know who he is ? "" said Dorian , listlessly . "" What do you mean ? Was n ' t he one of your men ? "" "" No , sir . Never saw him before . Seems like a sailor , sir . "" The pen dropped from Dorian Gray's hand , and he felt as if his heart had suddenly stopped beating . "" A sailor ? "" he cried out . "" Did you say a sailor ? "" "" Yes , sir . He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor ; tattooed on both arms , and that kind of thing . "" "" Was there anything found on him ? "" said Dorian , leaning forward and looking at the man with startled eyes . "" Anything that would tell his name ? "" "" Some money , sir – not much , and a six-shooter . There was no name of any kind . A decent-looking man , sir , but rough-like . A sort of sailor we think . "" Dorian started to his feet . A terrible hope fluttered past him . He clutched at it madly . "" Where is the body ? "" he exclaimed . "" Quick ! I must see it at once . "" "" It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm , sir . The folk do n't like to have that sort of thing in their houses . They say a corpse brings bad luck . "" "" The Home Farm ! Go there at once and meet me . Tell one of the grooms to bring my horse round . No. Never mind . I 'll go to the stables myself . It will save time . "" In less than a quarter of an hour , Dorian Gray was galloping down the long avenue as hard as he could go . The trees seemed to sweep past him in spectral procession , and wild shadows to fling themselves across his path . Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him . He lashed her across the neck with his crop . She cleft the dusky air like an arrow . The stones flew from her hoofs . At last he reached the Home Farm . Two men were loitering in the yard . He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them . In the farthest stable a light was glimmering . Something seemed to tell him that the body was there , and he hurried to the door and put his hand upon the latch . There he paused for a moment , feeling that he was on the brink of a discovery that would either make or mar his life . Then he thrust the door open and entered . On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers . A spotted handkerchief had been placed over the face . A coarse candle , stuck in a bottle , sputtered beside it . Dorian Gray shuddered . He felt that his could not be the hand to take the handkerchief away , and called out to one of the farm-servants to come to him . "" Take that thing off the face . I wish to see it , "" he said , clutching at the door-post for support . When the farm-servant had done so , he stepped forward . A cry of joy broke from his lips . The man who had been shot in the thicket was James Vane . He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body . As he rode home , his eyes were full of tears , for he knew he was safe ."	6
477	Every competition obviously needs some sets of rules . These rules are n ' t meant to give some personal advantage to me or my company but some things must be clear beforehand . 1 . Entrants can make any race they choose ( not neccessarily a current Hasslefree race , be creative ) , giving it any equipment they like in any pose they desire ..... so long as it 's 28mm scale ( not neccessarily 28mm tall ) castable and has a basing tag that fits in to a 30mm or 40mm round edged base ( as used by Warmachine and Dark Age ) . The sculpt should ideally be made of an epoxy suitable for vulcanising like green stuff . 2 . Using pieces of existing Hasslefree Miniatures is not allowed , other than those from heads and weapon sprues ( head sprues will be available in September ) . 3 . Secrecy is not an issue . You can put your WIPs all over the net if you like , so long as you do n't mind people nicking your ideas . 4 . We will create categories depending on the entries we receive . Initial judging will be by public vote to determine the top entries . Sally and I and a panel of judges ( who will not be allowed to vote for any entries they make ) will then choose the over all winner . 5 . The start date is today , Monday the 15th of August . Since we do n't want to panic anybody there 's no real rush to get your entries completed , the date for all entries to be with me is Jen's Birthday , December 18th . If it 's still the 18th of December anywhere in the world you can email me your entry . Your pictures need to be sent to kevinjameswhite @ totalise . c o . u k . Please send JPEG files compressed to ' best ' quality ( 80-90 % ) and try to make sure your pics are no larger than 150Kb each . 6 . The practicality of making the miniature will be judged alongside its degree of craftsmanship . If it 's a bugger to cast or if I 'm going to have to chop it up and put bits on sprues it might lose a few points . 7 . Results will be posted on our 2nd anniversary , 7th of January 2006 . 8 . The winner will receive a prize and a small amount of fame / notoriety . There is a prize of £ 175 in cold hard cash . I will also make sure that the winner is recognised as the sculptor of the piece where at all possible and also sculpt their name on the back of the basing tag . 9 . Entries will need to be original works of art - no copyrighted ideas please , other than recognised Hasslefree IP . Remember a 3D copy of a 2D original is still a violation of copyright , unless the original art is in the public domain or you have received ( written ) permission from the artist . 10 . Age Limit . Since the aim is to cast and sell these figures , contestants must be 18 years or older . If the contestant is under 18 , he or she must be able to produce written parental consent upon demand . 11 . Rule Amendments . Rules are subject to change and / or clarifications without notice , as per the decision of Kev and Sally . Entry categories may be subject to alteration depending on the level of response for each and existing categories may be split or combined . Final category placement of all entries shall be determined by the judges . 12 . Should the number and quality of submissions exceed expectations , we reserve the right to choose exclusively to purchase entries that do n't receive first place for a fee to be agreed upon between us and the Sculptor on an individual basis . No runners up prize offer will be greater than £ 175 and will depend entirely on our finances at the time . In this event all submissions so recognized will be subject to the same conditions as the over all winner . 13 . Should we not be able to agree on a price , the sculptor is free to dispose of the miniature at their discretion unless it contains recognisable components of existing Hasslefree Miniatures or Intellectual Property . Should this be the case , the miniature may not be sold to a party other than Hasslefree Miniatures . 14 . Fair Play . Only original sculpts will be accepted . By entering a figure in this contest you attest on your honour to be it 's creator and holder of all rights to this figure . By doing so you accept all legal consequences that could arise should the figure or the rights to it be part of someone else 's Intellectual Property . Also you will exonerate Hasslefree Miniatures for any legal claims that could result from entering the competition . 15 . Risk Attribution . Hasslefree Miniatures can not take responsibility for winning submissions lost in the mail , the risk lies with the sculptor . The sculptor must be willing to submit his / her sculpt to the mouldmaker's ministrations . As such , he or she should be aware that a lot of pressure will be exerted on the green during the mouldmaking process . A piece of putty will survive this moulding process in direct relationship to the amount of care and skill used to make the original . 16 . Figure Reproduction . As described in the introduction , castings of the winning entries will be sold by Hasslefree Miniatures as part of our HFP range . To this intent , the sculptor agrees to turn over the rights to reproduce , distribute and display the figure exclusively to Hasslefree under the terms and conditions as specified above . The sculptor will receive 10 copies of the mini and he or she may of course use the IP rights of the green and the mini for personal use .	9

1507	"Service Provider Featured Article CloudBand Ecosystem Program Promotes Network Virtualization Network functions virtualization ( NFV ) has the potential to dramatically change the telecommunications industry and drive increased agility and efficiency . While the promise of a virtualized network infrastructure is great , it also has the potential to disrupt the business models of service providers and vendors that service the industry . Rather than run from NFV , however , Alcatel-Lucent ( News - Alert ) has gotten behind the revolution and launched a program to bring together vendors and service providers in a partnership to evolve the industry , known as the CloudBand Ecosystem Program . CloudBand is the market's first NFV platform , according to the company , both open and multivendor while being stringent enough to accommodate the strict needs of carriers . With the CloudBand Ecosystem Program , Alcatel-Lucent is making CloudBand available to the entire industry for free in a move to foster collaboration and experimentation that will accelerate adoption of NFV . This program will help service providers collaborate with each other and application vendors in a cloud partner ecosystem , accelerate NFV transformation through the leveraging of best-of-breed NFV vendors , and speed service deployment , according to the company . Some of the examples of what NFV can already do for the industry include CloudBand's virtual load balancer , authoritative domain and caching name service ( DNS ) , firewall , and session border controller ( SBC ) . "" In a cloud environment , a virtual network function such as a software-based virtual load balancer appliance is a basic , yet fundamental building block to integrate network services with application delivery , "" noted an Alcatel-Lucent case study . "" They can be rapidly provisioned on demand , when and where needed through self-service mechanisms , making them a very useful , simple and cost-effective tool to fully optimize application delivery . "" The continued rapid growth in DNS queries makes DNS another area ripe for virtualization . "" Given the critical role this infrastructure plays in ensuring customer experience and reducing churn , relying on legacy hardware with closed interfaces , poor scalability and inflexible provisioning mechanisms is no longer viable , "" according to the company . Virtual firewalls is a further area where NFV makes obvious sense , in that such firewalls can be rapidly deployed when and where needed independent of physical locations or boundaries , then stitched together with other virtual or physical network services though the network functions virtualization concept of service chaining . A fourth example given by Alcatel-Lucent is the SBC . The SBC is well suited to cloud deployment as it can be fully virtualized and deployed on a NFV such as CloudBand . "" Cloud deployment eliminates the need for closed , customized or proprietary hardware . The common , distributed infrastructure – with centralized management and orchestration – can be shared between many similar carrier-specific applications to achieve economies of scale , "" noted Alcatel-Lucent . These and other network functions can already be virtualized with CloudBand . With the CloudBand Ecosystem Program , the list will undoubtedly get longer ."	2

46	"FATHER GORIOT To the great and illustrious Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire , a token of admiration for his works and genius . DE BALZAC . FATHER GORIOT Mme . Vauquer ( _nee_ de Conflans ) is an elderly person , who for the past forty years has kept a lodging-house in the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve , in the district that lies between the Latin Quarter and the Faubourg Saint-Marcel . Her house ( known in the neighborhood as the _Maison Vauquer_ ) receives men and women , old and young , and no word has ever been breathed against her respectable establishment ; but , at the same time , it must be said that as a matter of fact no young woman has been under her roof for thirty years , and that if a young man stays there for any length of time it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the slenderest . In 1819 , however , the time when this drama opens , there was an almost penniless young girl among Mme . Vauquer's boarders . That word drama has been somewhat discredited of late ; it has been overworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous literature ; but it must do service again here , not because this story is dramatic in the restricted sense of the word , but because some tears may perhaps be shed _intra et extra muros_ before it is over . Will any one without the walls of Paris understand it ? It is open to doubt . The only audience who could appreciate the results of close observation , the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color , are dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre , in a vale of crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud , a vale of sorrows which are real and joys too often hollow ; but this audience is so accustomed to terrible sensations , that only some unimaginable and well-neigh impossible woe could produce any lasting impression there . Now and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by reason of the complication of virtues and vices that bring them about , that egotism and selfishness are forced to pause and are moved to pity ; but the impression that they receive is like a luscious fruit , soon consumed . Civilization , like the car of Juggernaut , is scarcely stayed perceptibly in its progress by a heart less easy to break than the others that lie in its course ; this also is broken , and Civilization continues on her course triumphant . And you , too , will do the like ; you who with this book in your white hand will sink back among the cushions of your armchair , and say to yourself , "" Perhaps this may amuse me . "" You will read the story of Father Goriot's secret woes , and , dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite , will lay the blame of your insensibility upon the writer , and accuse him of exaggeration , of writing romances . Ah ! once for all , this drama is neither a fiction nor a romance ! _All is true_ , -- so true , that every one can discern the elements of the tragedy in his own house , perhaps in his own heart . The lodging-house is Mme . Vauquer's own property . It is still standing in the lower end of the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve , just where the road slopes so sharply down to the Rue de l ' Arbalete , that wheeled traffic seldom passes that way , because it is so stony and steep . This position is sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the streets shut in between the dome of the Pantheon and the dome of the Val-de-Grace , two conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish tone to the landscape and darken the whole district that lies beneath the shadow of their leaden-hued cupolas . In that district the pavements are clean and dry , there is neither mud nor water in the gutters , grass grows in the chinks of the walls . The most heedless passer-by feels the depressing influences of a place where the sound of wheels creates a sensation ; there is a grim look about the houses , a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls . A Parisian straying into a suburb apparently composed of lodging-houses and public institutions would see poverty and dullness , old age lying down to die , and joyous youth condemned to drudgery . It is the ugliest quarter of Paris , and , it may be added , the least known . But , before all things , the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve is like a bronze frame for a picture for which the mind can not be too well prepared by the contemplation of sad hues and sober images . Even so , step by step the daylight decreases , and the cicerone's droning voice grows hollower as the traveler descends into the Catacombs . The comparison holds good ! Who shall say which is more ghastly , the sight of the bleached skulls or of dried-up human hearts ? The front of the lodging-house is at right angles to the road , and looks out upon a little garden , so that you see the side of the house in section , as it were , from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve . Beneath the wall of the house front there lies a channel , a fathom wide , paved with cobble-stones , and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by geraniums and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white glazed earthenware pots . Access into the graveled walk is afforded by a door , above which the words MAISON VAUQUER may be read , and beneath , in rather smaller letters , "" _Lodgings for both sexes , etc. _ "" During the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a wicket to which a bell is attached . On the opposite wall , at the further end of the graveled walk , a green marble arch was painted once upon a time by a local artist , and in this semblance of a shrine a statue representing Cupid is installed ; a Parisian Cupid , so blistered and disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent hospitals , and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism . The half-obliterated inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the date of this work of art , for it bears witness to the widespread enthusiasm felt for Voltaire on his return to Paris in 1777 : "" Whoe ' er thou art , thy master see ; He is , or was , or ought to be . "" At night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door . The little garden is no wider than the front of the house ; it is shut in between the wall of the street and the partition wall of the neighboring house . A mantle of ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of passers-by to an effect which is picturesque in Paris , for each of the walls is covered with trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop of fruit , and furnish besides a subject of conversation for Mme . Vauquer and her lodgers ; every year the widow trembles for her vintage . A straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads to a clump of lime-trees at the further end of it ; _line_-trees , as Mme . Vauquer persists in calling them , in spite of the fact that she was a de Conflans , and regardless of repeated corrections from her lodgers . The central space between the walls is filled with artichokes and rows of pyramid fruit-trees , and surrounded by a border of lettuce , pot-herbs , and parsley . Under the lime-trees there are a few green-painted garden seats and a wooden table , and hither , during the dog-days , such of the lodgers as are rich enough to indulge in a cup of coffee come to take their pleasure , though it is hot enough to roast eggs even in the shade . The house itself is three stories high , without counting the attics under the roof . It is built of rough stone , and covered with the yellowish stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in Paris . There are five windows in each story in the front of the house ; all the blinds visible through the small square panes are drawn up awry , so that the lines are all at cross purposes . At the side of the house there are but two windows on each floor , and the lowest of all are adorned with a heavy iron grating . Behind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet , a space inhabited by a happy family of pigs , poultry , and rabbits ; the wood-shed is situated on the further side , and on the wall between the wood-shed and the kitchen window hangs the meat-safe , just above the place where the sink discharges its greasy streams . The cook sweeps all the refuse out through a little door into the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve , and frequently cleanses the yard with copious supplies of water , under pain of pestilence . The house might have been built on purpose for its present uses . Access is given by a French window to the first room on the ground floor , a sitting-room which looks out upon the street through the two barred windows already mentioned . Another door opens out of it into the dining-room , which is separated from the kitchen by the well of the staircase , the steps being constructed partly of wood , partly of tiles , which are colored and beeswaxed . Nothing can be more depressing than the sight of that sitting-room . The furniture is covered with horse hair woven in alternate dull and glossy stripes . There is a round table in the middle , with a purplish-red marble top , on which there stands , by way of ornament , the inevitable white china tea-service , covered with a half-effaced gilt network . The floor is sufficiently uneven , the wainscot rises to elbow height , and the rest of the wall space is decorated with a varnished paper , on which the principal scenes from _Telemaque_ are depicted , the various classical personages being colored . The subject between the two windows is the banquet given by Calypso to the son of Ulysses , displayed thereon for the admiration of the boarders , and has furnished jokes these forty years to the young men who show themselves superior to their position by making fun of the dinners to which poverty condemns them . The hearth is always so clean and neat that it is evident that a fire is only kindled there on great occasions ; the stone chimney-piece is adorned by a couple of vases filled with faded artificial flowers imprisoned under glass shades , on either side of a bluish marble clock in the very worst taste . The first room exhales an odor for which there is no name in the language , and which should be called the _odeur de pension_ . The damp atmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it ; it has a stuffy , musty , and rancid quality ; it permeates your clothing ; after-dinner scents seem to be mingled in it with smells from the kitchen and scullery and the reek of a hospital . It might be possible to describe it if some one should discover a process by which to distil from the atmosphere all the nauseating elements with which it is charged by the catarrhal exhalations of every individual lodger , young or old . Yet , in spite of these stale horrors , the sitting-room is as charming and as delicately perfumed as a boudoir , when compared with the adjoining dining-room . The paneled walls of that apartment were once painted some color , now a matter of conjecture , for the surface is incrusted with accumulated layers of grimy deposit , which cover it with fantastic outlines . A collection of dim-ribbed glass decanters , metal discs with a satin sheen on them , and piles of blue-edged earthenware plates of Touraine ware cover the sticky surfaces of the sideboards that line the room . In a corner stands a box containing a set of numbered pigeon-holes , in which the lodgers' table napkins , more or less soiled and stained with wine , are kept . Here you see that indestructible furniture never met with elsewhere , which finds its way into lodging-houses much as the wrecks of our civilization drift into hospitals for incurables . You expect in such places as these to find the weather-house whence a Capuchin issues on wet days ; you look to find the execrable engravings which spoil your appetite , framed every one in a black varnished frame , with a gilt beading round it ; you know the sort of tortoise-shell clock-case , inlaid with brass ; the green stove , the Argand lamps , covered with oil and dust , have met your eyes before . The oilcloth which covers the long table is so greasy that a waggish _externe_ will write his name on the surface , using his thumb-nail as a style . The chairs are broken-down invalids ; the wretched little hempen mats slip away from under your feet without slipping away for good ; and finally , the foot-warmers are miserable wrecks , hingeless , charred , broken away about the holes . It would be impossible to give an idea of the old , rotten , shaky , cranky , worm-eaten , halt , maimed , one-eyed , rickety , and ramshackle condition of the furniture without an exhaustive description , which would delay the progress of the story to an extent that impatient people would not pardon . The red tiles of the floor are full of depressions brought about by scouring and periodical renewings of color . In short , there is no illusory grace left to the poverty that reigns here ; it is dire , parsimonious , concentrated , threadbare poverty ; as yet it has not sunk into the mire , it is only splashed by it , and though not in rags as yet , its clothing is ready to drop to pieces . This apartment is in all its glory at seven o ' clock in the morning , when Mme . Vauquer's cat appears , announcing the near approach of his mistress , and jumps upon the sideboards to sniff at the milk in the bowls , each protected by a plate , while he purrs his morning greeting to the world . A moment later the widow shows her face ; she is tricked out in a net cap attached to a false front set on awry , and shuffles into the room in her slipshod fashion . She is an oldish woman , with a bloated countenance , and a nose like a parrot's beak set in the middle of it ; her fat little hands ( she is as sleek as a church rat ) and her shapeless , slouching figure are in keeping with the room that reeks of misfortune , where hope is reduced to speculate for the meanest stakes . Mme . Vauquer alone can breathe that tainted air without being disheartened by it . Her face is as fresh as a frosty morning in autumn ; there are wrinkles about the eyes that vary in their expression from the set smile of a ballet-dancer to the dark , suspicious scowl of a discounter of bills ; in short , she is at once the embodiment and interpretation of her lodging-house , as surely as her lodging-house implies the existence of its mistress . You can no more imagine the one without the other , than you can think of a jail without a turnkey . The unwholesome corpulence of the little woman is produced by the life she leads , just as typhus fever is bred in the tainted air of a hospital . The very knitted woolen petticoat that she wears beneath a skirt made of an old gown , with the wadding protruding through the rents in the material , is a sort of epitome of the sitting-room , the dining-room , and the little garden ; it discovers the cook , it foreshadows the lodgers--the picture of the house is completed by the portrait of its mistress . Mme . Vauquer at the age of fifty is like all women who "" have seen a deal of trouble . "" She has the glassy eyes and innocent air of a trafficker in flesh and blood , who will wax virtuously indignant to obtain a higher price for her services , but who is quite ready to betray a Georges or a Pichegru , if a Georges or a Pichegru were in hiding and still to be betrayed , or for any other expedient that may alleviate her lot . Still , "" she is a good woman at bottom , "" said the lodgers who believed that the widow was wholly dependent upon the money that they paid her , and sympathized when they heard her cough and groan like one of themselves . What had M. Vauquer been ? The lady was never very explicit on this head . How had she lost her money ? "" Through trouble , "" was her answer . He had treated her badly , had left her nothing but her eyes to cry over his cruelty , the house she lived in , and the privilege of pitying nobody , because , so she was wont to say , she herself had been through every possible misfortune . Sylvie , the stout cook , hearing her mistress' shuffling footsteps , hastened to serve the lodgers' breakfasts . Beside those who lived in the house , Mme . Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals ; but these _externes_ usually only came to dinner , for which they paid thirty francs a month . At the time when this story begins , the lodging-house contained seven inmates . The best rooms in the house were on the first story , Mme . Vauquer herself occupying the least important , while the rest were let to a Mme . Couture , the widow of a commissary-general in the service of the Republic . With her lived Victorine Taillefer , a schoolgirl , to whom she filled the place of mother . These two ladies paid eighteen hundred francs a year . The two sets of rooms on the second floor were respectively occupied by an old man named Poiret and a man of forty or thereabouts , the wearer of a black wig and dyed whiskers , who gave out that he was a retired merchant , and was addressed as M. Vautrin . Two of the four rooms on the third floor were also let--one to an elderly spinster , a Mlle . Michonneau , and the other to a retired manufacturer of vermicelli , Italian paste and starch , who allowed the others to address him as "" Father Goriot . "" The remaining rooms were allotted to various birds of passage , to impecunious students , who like "" Father Goriot "" and Mlle . Michonneau , could only muster forty-five francs a month to pay for their board and lodging . Mme . Vauquer had little desire for lodgers of this sort ; they ate too much bread , and she only took them in default of better . At that time one of the rooms was tenanted by a law student , a young man from the neighborhood of Angouleme , one of a large family who pinched and starved themselves to spare twelve hundred francs a year for him . Misfortune had accustomed Eugene de Rastignac , for that was his name , to work . He belonged to the number of young men who know as children that their parents' hopes are centered on them , and deliberately prepare themselves for a great career , subordinating their studies from the first to this end , carefully watching the indications of the course of events , calculating the probable turn that affairs will take , that they may be the first to profit by them . But for his observant curiosity , and the skill with which he managed to introduce himself into the salons of Paris , this story would not have been colored by the tones of truth which it certainly owes to him , for they are entirely due to his penetrating sagacity and desire to fathom the mysteries of an appalling condition of things , which was concealed as carefully by the victim as by those who had brought it to pass . Above the third story there was a garret where the linen was hung to dry , and a couple of attics . Christophe , the man-of-all-work , slept in one , and Sylvie , the stout cook , in the other . Beside the seven inmates thus enumerated , taking one year with another , some eight law or medical students dined in the house , as well as two or three regular comers who lived in the neighborhood . There were usually eighteen people at dinner , and there was room , if need be , for twenty at Mme . Vauquer's table ; at breakfast , however , only the seven lodgers appeared . It was almost like a family party . Every one came down in dressing-gown and slippers , and the conversation usually turned on anything that had happened the evening before ; comments on the dress or appearance of the dinner contingent were exchanged in friendly confidence . These seven lodgers were Mme . Vauquer's spoiled children . Among them she distributed , with astronomical precision , the exact proportion of respect and attention due to the varying amounts they paid for their board . One single consideration influenced all these human beings thrown together by chance . The two second-floor lodgers only paid seventy-two francs a month . Such prices as these are confined to the Faubourg Saint-Marcel and the district between La Bourbe and the Salpetriere ; and , as might be expected , poverty , more or less apparent , weighed upon them all , Mme . Couture being the sole exception to the rule . The dreary surroundings were reflected in the costumes of the inmates of the house ; all were alike threadbare . The color of the men's coats were problematical ; such shoes , in more fashionable quarters , are only to be seen lying in the gutter ; the cuffs and collars were worn and frayed at the edges ; every limp article of clothing looked like the ghost of its former self . The women's dresses were faded , old-fashioned , dyed and re-dyed ; they wore gloves that were glazed with hard wear , much-mended lace , dingy ruffles , crumpled muslin fichus . So much for their clothing ; but , for the most part , their frames were solid enough ; their constitutions had weathered the storms of life ; their cold , hard faces were worn like coins that have been withdrawn from circulation , but there were greedy teeth behind the withered lips . Dramas brought to a close or still in progress are foreshadowed by the sight of such actors as these , not the dramas that are played before the footlights and against a background of painted canvas , but dumb dramas of life , frost-bound dramas that sere hearts like fire , dramas that do not end with the actors' lives . Mlle . Michonneau , that elderly young lady , screened her weak eyes from the daylight by a soiled green silk shade with a rim of brass , an object fit to scare away the Angel of Pity himself . Her shawl , with its scanty , draggled fringe , might have covered a skeleton , so meagre and angular was the form beneath it . Yet she must have been pretty and shapely once . What corrosive had destroyed the feminine outlines ? Was it trouble , or vice , or greed ? Had she loved too well ? Had she been a second-hand clothes dealer , a frequenter of the backstairs of great houses , or had she been merely a courtesan ? Was she expiating the flaunting triumphs of a youth overcrowded with pleasures by an old age in which she was shunned by every passer-by ? Her vacant gaze sent a chill through you ; her shriveled face seemed like a menace . Her voice was like the shrill , thin note of the grasshopper sounding from the thicket when winter is at hand . She said that she had nursed an old gentleman , ill of catarrh of the bladder , and left to die by his children , who thought that he had nothing left . His bequest to her , a life annuity of a thousand francs , was periodically disputed by his heirs , who mingled slander with their persecutions . In spite of the ravages of conflicting passions , her face retained some traces of its former fairness and fineness of tissue , some vestiges of the physical charms of her youth still survived . M. Poiret was a sort of automaton . He might be seen any day sailing like a gray shadow along the walks of the Jardin des Plantes , on his head a shabby cap , a cane with an old yellow ivory handle in the tips of his thin fingers ; the outspread skirts of his threadbare overcoat failed to conceal his meagre figure ; his breeches hung loosely on his shrunken limbs ; the thin , blue-stockinged legs trembled like those of a drunken man ; there was a notable breach of continuity between the dingy white waistcoat and crumpled shirt frills and the cravat twisted about a throat like a turkey gobbler 's ; altogether , his appearance set people wondering whether this outlandish ghost belonged to the audacious race of the sons of Japhet who flutter about on the Boulevard Italien . What devouring kind of toil could have so shriveled him ? What devouring passions had darkened that bulbous countenance , which would have seemed outrageous as a caricature ? What had he been ? Well , perhaps he had been part of the machinery of justice , a clerk in the office to which the executioner sends in his accounts , -- so much for providing black veils for parricides , so much for sawdust , so much for pulleys and cord for the knife . Or he might have been a receiver at the door of a public slaughter-house , or a sub-inspector of nuisances . Indeed , the man appeared to have been one of the beasts of burden in our great social mill ; one of those Parisian Ratons whom their Bertrands do not even know by sight ; a pivot in the obscure machinery that disposes of misery and things unclean ; one of those men , in short , at sight of whom we are prompted to remark that , "" After all , we can not do without them . "" Stately Paris ignores the existence of these faces bleached by moral or physical suffering ; but , then , Paris is in truth an ocean that no line can plumb . You may survey its surface and describe it ; but no matter how numerous and painstaking the toilers in this sea , there will always be lonely and unexplored regions in its depths , caverns unknown , flowers and pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or forgotten by the divers of literature . The Maison Vauquer is one of these curious monstrosities . Two , however , of Mme . Vauquer's boarders formed a striking contrast to the rest . There was a sickly pallor , such as is often seen in anaemic girls , in Mlle . Victorine Taillefer's face ; and her unvarying expression of sadness , like her embarrassed manner and pinched look , was in keeping with the general wretchedness of the establishment in the Rue Nueve-Saint-Genevieve , which forms a background to this picture ; but her face was young , there was youthfulness in her voice and elasticity in her movements . This young misfortune was not unlike a shrub , newly planted in an uncongenial soil , where its leaves have already begun to wither . The outlines of her figure , revealed by her dress of the simplest and cheapest materials , were also youthful . There was the same kind of charm about her too slender form , her faintly colored face and light-brown hair , that modern poets find in mediaeval statuettes ; and a sweet expression , a look of Christian resignation in the dark gray eyes . She was pretty by force of contrast ; if she had been happy , she would have been charming . Happiness is the poetry of woman , as the toilette is her tinsel . If the delightful excitement of a ball had made the pale face glow with color ; if the delights of a luxurious life had brought the color to the wan cheeks that were slightly hollowed already ; if love had put light into the sad eyes , then Victorine might have ranked among the fairest ; but she lacked the two things which create woman a second time--pretty dresses and love-letters . A book might have been made of her story . Her father was persuaded that he had sufficient reason for declining to acknowledge her , and allowed her a bare six hundred francs a year ; he had further taken measures to disinherit his daughter , and had converted all his real estate into personalty , that he might leave it undivided to his son . Victorine's mother had died broken-hearted in Mme . Couture's house ; and the latter , who was a near relation , had taken charge of the little orphan . Unluckily , the widow of the commissary-general to the armies of the Republic had nothing in the world but her jointure and her widow's pension , and some day she might be obliged to leave the helpless , inexperienced girl to the mercy of the world . The good soul , therefore , took Victorine to mass every Sunday , and to confession once a fortnight , thinking that , in any case , she would bring up her ward to be devout . She was right ; religion offered a solution of the problem of the young girl's future . The poor child loved the father who refused to acknowledge her . Once every year she tried to see him to deliver her mother's message of forgiveness , but every year hitherto she had knocked at that door in vain ; her father was inexorable . Her brother , her only means of communication , had not come to see her for four years , and had sent her no assistance ; yet she prayed to God to unseal her father's eyes and to soften her brother's heart , and no accusations mingled with her prayers . Mme . Couture and Mme . Vauquer exhausted the vocabulary of abuse , and failed to find words that did justice to the banker's iniquitous conduct ; but while they heaped execrations on the millionaire , Victorine's words were as gentle as the moan of the wounded dove , and affection found expression even in the cry drawn from her by pain . Eugene de Rastignac was a thoroughly southern type ; he had a fair complexion , blue eyes , black hair . In his figure , manner , and his whole bearing it was easy to see that he had either come of a noble family , or that , from his earliest childhood , he had been gently bred . If he was careful of his wardrobe , only taking last year's clothes into daily wear , still upon occasion he could issue forth as a young man of fashion . Ordinarily he wore a shabby coat and waistcoat , the limp black cravat , untidily knotted , that students affect , trousers that matched the rest of his costume , and boots that had been resoled . Vautrin ( the man of forty with the dyed whiskers ) marked a transition stage between these two young people and the others . He was the kind of man that calls forth the remark : "" He looks a jovial sort ! "" He had broad shoulders , a well-developed chest , muscular arms , and strong square-fisted hands ; the joints of his fingers were covered with tufts of fiery red hair . His face was furrowed by premature wrinkles ; there was a certain hardness about it in spite of his bland and insinuating manner . His bass voice was by no means unpleasant , and was in keeping with his boisterous laughter . He was always obliging , always in good spirits ; if anything went wrong with one of the locks , he would soon unscrew it , take it to pieces , file it , oil and clean and set it in order , and put it back in its place again ; "" I am an old hand at it , "" he used to say . Not only so , he knew all about ships , the sea , France , foreign countries , men , business , law , great houses and prisons , -- there was nothing that he did not know . If any one complained rather more than usual , he would offer his services at once . He had several times lent money to Mme . Vauquer , or to the boarders ; but , somehow , those whom he obliged felt that they would sooner face death than fail to repay him ; a certain resolute look , sometimes seen on his face , inspired fear of him , for all his appearance of easy good-nature . In the way he spat there was an imperturbable coolness which seemed to indicate that this was a man who would not stick at a crime to extricate himself from a false position . His eyes , like those of a pitiless judge , seemed to go to the very bottom of all questions , to read all natures , all feelings and thoughts . His habit of life was very regular ; he usually went out after breakfast , returning in time for dinner , and disappeared for the rest of the evening , letting himself in about midnight with a latch key , a privilege that Mme . Vauquer accorded to no other boarder . But then he was on very good terms with the widow ; he used to call her "" mamma , "" and put his arm round her waist , a piece of flattery perhaps not appreciated to the full ! The worthy woman might imagine this to be an easy feat ; but , as a matter of fact , no arm but Vautrin's was long enough to encircle her . It was a characteristic trait of his generously to pay fifteen francs a month for the cup of coffee with a dash of brandy in it , which he took after dinner . Less superficial observers than young men engulfed by the whirlpool of Parisian life , or old men , who took no interest in anything that did not directly concern them , would not have stopped short at the vaguely unsatisfactory impression that Vautrin made upon them . He knew or guessed the concerns of every one about him ; but none of them had been able to penetrate his thoughts , or to discover his occupation . He had deliberately made his apparent good-nature , his unfailing readiness to oblige , and his high spirits into a barrier between himself and the rest of them , but not seldom he gave glimpses of appalling depths of character . He seemed to delight in scourging the upper classes of society with the lash of his tongue , to take pleasure in convicting it of inconsistency , in mocking at law and order with some grim jest worthy of Juvenal , as if some grudge against the social system rankled in him , as if there were some mystery carefully hidden away in his life . Mlle . Taillefer felt attracted , perhaps unconsciously , by the strength of the one man , and the good looks of the other ; her stolen glances and secret thoughts were divided between them ; but neither of them seemed to take any notice of her , although some day a chance might alter her position , and she would be a wealthy heiress . For that matter , there was not a soul in the house who took any trouble to investigate the various chronicles of misfortunes , real or imaginary , related by the rest . Each one regarded the others with indifference , tempered by suspicion ; it was a natural result of their relative positions . Practical assistance not one could give , this they all knew , and they had long since exhausted their stock of condolence over previous discussions of their grievances . They were in something the same position as an elderly couple who have nothing left to say to each other . The routine of existence kept them in contact , but they were parts of a mechanism which wanted oil . There was not one of them but would have passed a blind man begging in the street , not one that felt moved to pity by a tale of misfortune , not one who did not see in death the solution of the all-absorbing problem of misery which left them cold to the most terrible anguish in others . The happiest of these hapless beings was certainly Mme . Vauquer , who reigned supreme over this hospital supported by voluntary contributions . For her , the little garden , which silence , and cold , and rain , and drought combined to make as dreary as an Asian _steppe_ , was a pleasant shaded nook ; the gaunt yellow house , the musty odors of a back shop had charms for her , and for her alone . Those cells belonged to her . She fed those convicts condemned to penal servitude for life , and her authority was recognized among them . Where else in Paris would they have found wholesome food in sufficient quantity at the prices she charged them , and rooms which they were at liberty to make , if not exactly elegant or comfortable , at any rate clean and healthy ? If she had committed some flagrant act of injustice , the victim would have borne it in silence . Such a gathering contained , as might have been expected , the elements out of which a complete society might be constructed . And , as in a school , as in the world itself , there was among the eighteen men and women who met round the dinner table a poor creature , despised by all the others , condemned to be the butt of all their jokes . At the beginning of Eugene de Rastignac's second twelvemonth , this figure suddenly started out into bold relief against the background of human forms and faces among which the law student was yet to live for another two years to come . This laughing-stock was the retired vermicelli-merchant , Father Goriot , upon whose face a painter , like the historian , would have concentrated all the light in his picture . How had it come about that the boarders regarded him with a half-malignant contempt ? Why did they subject the oldest among their number to a kind of persecution , in which there was mingled some pity , but no respect for his misfortunes ? Had he brought it on himself by some eccentricity or absurdity , which is less easily forgiven or forgotten than more serious defects ? The question strikes at the root of many a social injustice . Perhaps it is only human nature to inflict suffering on anything that will endure suffering , whether by reason of its genuine humility , or indifference , or sheer helplessness . Do we not , one and all , like to feel our strength even at the expense of some one or of something ? The poorest sample of humanity , the street arab , will pull the bell handle at every street door in bitter weather , and scramble up to write his name on the unsullied marble of a monument . In the year 1813 , at the age of sixty-nine or thereabouts , "" Father Goriot "" had sold his business and retired--to Mme . Vauquer's boarding house . When he first came there he had taken the rooms now occupied by Mme . Couture ; he had paid twelve hundred francs a year like a man to whom five louis more or less was a mere trifle . For him Mme . Vauquer had made various improvements in the three rooms destined for his use , in consideration of a certain sum paid in advance , so it was said , for the miserable furniture , that is to say , for some yellow cotton curtains , a few chairs of stained wood covered with Utrecht velvet , several wretched colored prints in frames , and wall papers that a little suburban tavern would have disdained . Possibly it was the careless generosity with which Father Goriot allowed himself to be overreached at this period of his life ( they called him Monsieur Goriot very respectfully then ) that gave Mme . Vauquer the meanest opinion of his business abilities ; she looked on him as an imbecile where money was concerned . Goriot had brought with him a considerable wardrobe , the gorgeous outfit of a retired tradesman who denies himself nothing . Mme . Vauquer's astonished eyes beheld no less than eighteen cambric-fronted shirts , the splendor of their fineness being enhanced by a pair of pins each bearing a large diamond , and connected by a short chain , an ornament which adorned the vermicelli-maker's shirt front . He usually wore a coat of corn-flower blue ; his rotund and portly person was still further set off by a clean white waistcoat , and a gold chain and seals which dangled over that broad expanse . When his hostess accused him of being "" a bit of a beau , "" he smiled with the vanity of a citizen whose foible is gratified . His cupboards ( _ormoires_ , as he called them in the popular dialect ) were filled with a quantity of plate that he brought with him . The widow's eyes gleamed as she obligingly helped him to unpack the soup ladles , table-spoons , forks , cruet-stands , tureens , dishes , and breakfast services--all of silver , which were duly arranged upon shelves , besides a few more or less handsome pieces of plate , all weighing no inconsiderable number of ounces ; he could not bring himself to part with these gifts that reminded him of past domestic festivals . "" This was my wife 's present to me on the first anniversary of our wedding day , "" he said to Mme . Vauquer , as he put away a little silver posset dish , with two turtle-doves billing on the cover . "" Poor dear ! she spent on it all the money she had saved before we were married . Do you know , I would sooner scratch the earth with my nails for a living , madame , than part with that . But I shall be able to take my coffee out of it every morning for the rest of my days , thank the Lord ! I am not to be pitied . There 's not much fear of my starving for some time to come . "" Finally , Mme . Vauquer's magpie's eye had discovered and read certain entries in the list of shareholders in the funds , and , after a rough calculation , was disposed to credit Goriot ( worthy man ) with something like ten thousand francs a year . From that day forward Mme . Vauquer ( _nee_ de Conflans ) , who , as a matter of fact , had seen forty-eight summers , though she would only own to thirty-nine of them--Mme . Vauquer had her own ideas . Though Goriot's eyes seemed to have shrunk in their sockets , though they were weak and watery , owing to some glandular affection which compelled him to wipe them continually , she considered him to be a very gentlemanly and pleasant-looking man . Moreover , the widow saw favorable indications of character in the well-developed calves of his legs and in his square-shaped nose , indications still further borne out by the worthy man's full-moon countenance and look of stupid good-nature . This , in all probability , was a strongly-build animal , whose brains mostly consisted in a capacity for affection . His hair , worn in _ailes de pigeon_ , and duly powdered every morning by the barber from the Ecole Polytechnique , described five points on his low forehead , and made an elegant setting to his face . Though his manners were somewhat boorish , he was always as neat as a new pin and he took his snuff in a lordly way , like a man who knows that his snuff-box is always likely to be filled with maccaboy , so that when Mme . Vauquer lay down to rest on the day of M. Goriot's installation , her heart , like a larded partridge , sweltered before the fire of a burning desire to shake off the shroud of Vauquer and rise again as Goriot . She would marry again , sell her boarding-house , give her hand to this fine flower of citizenship , become a lady of consequence in the quarter , and ask for subscriptions for charitable purposes ; she would make little Sunday excursions to Choisy , Soissy , Gentilly ; she would have a box at the theatre when she liked , instead of waiting for the author's tickets that one of her boarders sometimes gave her , in July ; the whole Eldorado of a little Parisian household rose up before Mme . Vauquer in her dreams . Nobody knew that she herself possessed forty thousand francs , accumulated _sou by sou_ , that was her secret ; surely as far as money was concerned she was a very tolerable match . "" And in other respects , I am quite his equal , "" she said to herself , turning as if to assure herself of the charms of a form that the portly Sylvie found moulded in down feathers every morning . For three months from that day Mme . Veuve Vauquer availed herself of the services of M. Goriot's coiffeur , and went to some expense over her toilette , expense justifiable on the ground that she owed it to herself and her establishment to pay some attention to appearances when such highly-respectable persons honored her house with their presence . She expended no small amount of ingenuity in a sort of weeding process of her lodgers , announcing her intention of receiving henceforward none but people who were in every way select . If a stranger presented himself , she let him know that M. Goriot , one of the best known and most highly-respected merchants in Paris , had singled out her boarding-house for a residence . She drew up a prospectus headed MAISON VAUQUER , in which it was asserted that hers was "" _one of the oldest and most highly recommended boarding-houses in the Latin Quarter_ . "" "" From the windows of the house , "" thus ran the prospectus , "" there is a charming view of the Vallee des Gobelins ( so there is--from the third floor ) , and a _beautiful_ garden , _extending_ down to _an avenue of lindens_ at the further end . "" Mention was made of the bracing air of the place and its quiet situation . It was this prospectus that attracted Mme . la Comtesse de l ' Ambermesnil , a widow of six and thirty , who was awaiting the final settlement of her husband's affairs , and of another matter regarding a pension due to her as the wife of a general who had died "" on the field of battle . "" On this Mme . Vauquer saw to her table , lighted a fire daily in the sitting-room for nearly six months , and kept the promise of her prospectus , even going to some expense to do so . And the Countess , on her side , addressed Mme . Vauquer as "" my dear , "" and promised her two more boarders , the Baronne de Vaumerland and the widow of a colonel , the late Comte de Picquoisie , who were about to leave a boarding-house in the Marais , where the terms were higher than at the Maison Vauquer . Both these ladies , moreover , would be very well to do when the people at the War Office had come to an end of their formalities . "" But Government departments are always so dilatory , "" the lady added . After dinner the two widows went together up to Mme . Vauquer's room , and had a snug little chat over some cordial and various delicacies reserved for the mistress of the house . Mme . Vauquer's ideas as to Goriot were cordially approved by Mme . de l ' Ambermesnil ; it was a capital notion , which for that matter she had guessed from the very first ; in her opinion the vermicelli maker was an excellent man . "" Ah ! my dear lady , such a well-preserved man of his age , as sound as my eyesight--a man who might make a woman happy ! "" said the widow . The good-natured Countess turned to the subject of Mme . Vauquer's dress , which was not in harmony with her projects . "" You must put yourself on a war footing , "" said she . After much serious consideration the two widows went shopping together--they purchased a hat adorned with ostrich feathers and a cap at the Palais Royal , and the Countess took her friend to the Magasin de la Petite Jeannette , where they chose a dress and a scarf . Thus equipped for the campaign , the widow looked exactly like the prize animal hung out for a sign above an a la mode beef shop ; but she herself was so much pleased with the improvement , as she considered it , in her appearance , that she felt that she lay under some obligation to the Countess ; and , though by no means open-handed , she begged that lady to accept a hat that cost twenty francs . The fact was that she needed the Countess' services on the delicate mission of sounding Goriot ; the countess must sing her praises in his ears . Mme . de l ' Ambermesnil lent herself very good-naturedly to this manoeuvre , began her operations , and succeeded in obtaining a private interview ; but the overtures that she made , with a view to securing him for herself , were received with embarrassment , not to say a repulse . She left him , revolted by his coarseness . "" My angel , "" said she to her dear friend , "" you will make nothing of that man yonder . He is absurdly suspicious , and he is a mean curmudgeon , an idiot , a fool ; you would never be happy with him . "" After what had passed between M. Goriot and Mme . de l ' Ambermesnil , the Countess would no longer live under the same roof . She left the next day , forgot to pay for six months' board , and left behind her wardrobe , cast-off clothing to the value of five francs . Eagerly and persistently as Mme . Vauquer sought her quondam lodger , the Comtesse de l ' Ambermesnil was never heard of again in Paris . The widow often talked of this deplorable business , and regretted her own too confiding disposition . As a matter of fact , she was as suspicious as a cat ; but she was like many other people , who can not trust their own kin and put themselves at the mercy of the next chance comer--an odd but common phenomenon , whose causes may readily be traced to the depths of the human heart . Perhaps there are people who know that they have nothing more to look for from those with whom they live ; they have shown the emptiness of their hearts to their housemates , and in their secret selves they are conscious that they are severely judged , and that they deserve to be judged severely ; but still they feel an unconquerable craving for praises that they do not hear , or they are consumed by a desire to appear to possess , in the eyes of a new audience , the qualities which they have not , hoping to win the admiration or affection of strangers at the risk of forfeiting it again some day . Or , once more , there are other mercenary natures who never do a kindness to a friend or a relation simply because these have a claim upon them , while a service done to a stranger brings its reward to self-love . Such natures feel but little affection for those who are nearest to them ; they keep their kindness for remoter circles of acquaintance , and show most to those who dwell on its utmost limits . Mme . Vauquer belonged to both these essentially mean , false , and execrable classes . "" If I had been there at the time , "" Vautrin would say at the end of the story , "" I would have shown her up , and that misfortune would not have befallen you . I know that kind of phiz ! "" Like all narrow natures , Mme . Vauquer was wont to confine her attention to events , and did not go very deeply into the causes that brought them about ; she likewise preferred to throw the blame of her own mistakes on other people , so she chose to consider that the honest vermicelli maker was responsible for her misfortune . It had opened her eyes , so she said , with regard to him . As soon as she saw that her blandishments were in vain , and that her outlay on her toilette was money thrown away , she was not slow to discover the reason of his indifference . It became plain to her at once that there was _some other attraction_ , to use her own expression . In short , it was evident that the hope she had so fondly cherished was a baseless delusion , and that she would "" never make anything out of that man yonder , "" in the Countess' forcible phrase . The Countess seemed to have been a judge of character . Mme . Vauquer's aversion was naturally more energetic than her friendship , for her hatred was not in proportion to her love , but to her disappointed expectations . The human heart may find here and there a resting-place short of the highest height of affection , but we seldom stop in the steep , downward slope of hatred . Still , M. Goriot was a lodger , and the widow's wounded self-love could not vent itself in an explosion of wrath ; like a monk harassed by the prior of his convent , she was forced to stifle her sighs of disappointment , and to gulp down her craving for revenge . Little minds find gratification for their feelings , benevolent or otherwise , by a constant exercise of petty ingenuity . The widow employed her woman's malice to devise a system of covert persecution . She began by a course of retrenchment--various luxuries which had found their way to the table appeared there no more . "" No more gherkins , no more anchovies ; they have made a fool of me ! "" she said to Sylvie one morning , and they returned to the old bill of fare . The thrifty frugality necessary to those who mean to make their way in the world had become an inveterate habit of life with M. Goriot . Soup , boiled beef , and a dish of vegetables had been , and always would be , the dinner he liked best , so Mme . Vauquer found it very difficult to annoy a boarder whose tastes were so simple . He was proof against her malice , and in desperation she spoke to him and of him slightingly before the other lodgers , who began to amuse themselves at his expense , and so gratified her desire for revenge . Towards the end of the first year the widow's suspicions had reached such a pitch that she began to wonder how it was that a retired merchant with a secure income of seven or eight thousand livres , the owner of such magnificent plate and jewelry handsome enough for a kept mistress , should be living in her house . Why should he devote so small a proportion of his money to his expenses ? Until the first year was nearly at an end , Goriot had dined out once or twice every week , but these occasions came less frequently , and at last he was scarcely absent from the dinner-table twice a month . It was hardly expected that Mme . Vauquer should regard the increased regularity of her boarder's habits with complacency , when those little excursions of his had been so much to her interest . She attributed the change not so much to a gradual diminution of fortune as to a spiteful wish to annoy his hostess . It is one of the most detestable habits of a Liliputian mind to credit other people with its own malignant pettiness . Unluckily , towards the end of the second year , M. Goriot's conduct gave some color to the idle talk about him . He asked Mme . Vauquer to give him a room on the second floor , and to make a corresponding reduction in her charges . Apparently , such strict economy was called for , that he did without a fire all through the winter . Mme . Vauquer asked to be paid in advance , an arrangement to which M. Goriot consented , and thenceforward she spoke of him as "" Father Goriot . "" What had brought about this decline and fall ? Conjecture was keen , but investigation was difficult . Father Goriot was not communicative ; in the sham countess' phrase he was "" a curmudgeon . "" Empty-headed people who babble about their own affairs because they have nothing else to occupy them , naturally conclude that if people say nothing of their doings it is because their doings will not bear being talked about ; so the highly respectable merchant became a scoundrel , and the late beau was an old rogue . Opinion fluctuated . Sometimes , according to Vautrin , who came about this time to live in the Maison Vauquer , Father Goriot was a man who went on ' Change and _dabbled_ ( to use the sufficiently expressive language of the Stock Exchange ) in stocks and shares after he had ruined himself by heavy speculation . Sometimes it was held that he was one of those petty gamblers who nightly play for small stakes until they win a few francs . A theory that he was a detective in the employ of the Home Office found favor at one time , but Vautrin urged that "" Goriot was not sharp enough for one of that sort . "" There were yet other solutions ; Father Goriot was a skinflint , a shark of a money-lender , a man who lived by selling lottery tickets . He was by turns all the most mysterious brood of vice and shame and misery ; yet , however vile his life might be , the feeling of repulsion which he aroused in others was not so strong that he must be banished from their society--he paid his way . Besides , Goriot had his uses , every one vented his spleen or sharpened his wit on him ; he was pelted with jokes and belabored with hard words . The general consensus of opinion was in favor of a theory which seemed the most likely ; this was Mme . Vauquer's view . According to her , the man so well preserved at his time of life , as sound as her eyesight , with whom a woman might be very happy , was a libertine who had strange tastes . These are the facts upon which Mme . Vauquer's slanders were based . Early one morning , some few months after the departure of the unlucky Countess who had managed to live for six months at the widow's expense , Mme . Vauquer ( not yet dressed ) heard the rustle of a silk dress and a young woman's light footstep on the stair ; some one was going to Goriot's room . He seemed to expect the visit , for his door stood ajar . The portly Sylvie presently came up to tell her mistress that a girl too pretty to be honest , "" dressed like a goddess , "" and not a speck of mud on her laced cashmere boots , had glided in from the street like a snake , had found the kitchen , and asked for M. Goriot's room . Mme . Vauquer and the cook , listening , overheard several words affectionately spoken during the visit , which lasted for some time . When M. Goriot went downstairs with the lady , the stout Sylvie forthwith took her basket and followed the lover-like couple , under pretext of going to do her marketing . "" M. Goriot must be awfully rich , all the same , madame , "" she reported on her return , "" to keep her in such style . Just imagine it ! There was a splendid carriage waiting at the corner of the Place de l ' Estrapade , and _she_ got into it . "" While they were at dinner that evening , Mme . Vauquer went to the window and drew the curtain , as the sun was shining into Goriot's eyes . "" You are beloved of fair ladies , M. Goriot--the sun seeks you out , "" she said , alluding to his visitor . "" _Peste ! _ you have good taste ; she was very pretty . "" "" That was my daughter , "" he said , with a kind of pride in his voice , and the rest chose to consider this as the fatuity of an old man who wishes to save appearances . A month after this visit M. Goriot received another . The same daughter who had come to see him that morning came again after dinner , this time in evening dress . The boarders , in deep discussion in the dining-room , caught a glimpse of a lovely , fair-haired woman , slender , graceful , and much too distinguished-looking to be a daughter of Father Goriot's . "" Two of them ! "" cried the portly Sylvie , who did not recognize the lady of the first visit . A few days later , and another young lady--a tall , well-moulded brunette , with dark hair and bright eyes--came to ask for M. Goriot . "" Three of them ! "" said Sylvie . Then the second daughter , who had first come in the morning to see her father , came shortly afterwards in the evening . She wore a ball dress , and came in a carriage . "" Four of them ! "" commented Mme . Vauquer and her plump handmaid . Sylvie saw not a trace of resemblance between this great lady and the girl in her simple morning dress who had entered her kitchen on the occasion of her first visit . At that time Goriot was paying twelve hundred francs a year to his landlady , and Mme . Vauquer saw nothing out of the common in the fact that a rich man had four or five mistresses ; nay , she thought it very knowing of him to pass them off as his daughters . She was not at all inclined to draw a hard-and-fast line , or to take umbrage at his sending for them to the Maison Vauquer ; yet , inasmuch as these visits explained her boarder's indifference to her , she went so far ( at the end of the second year ) as to speak of him as an "" ugly old wretch . "" When at length her boarder declined to nine hundred francs a year , she asked him very insolently what he took her house to be , after meeting one of these ladies on the stairs . Father Goriot answered that the lady was his eldest daughter . "" So you have two or three dozen daughters , have you ? "" said Mme . Vauquer sharply . "" I have only two , "" her boarder answered meekly , like a ruined man who is broken in to all the cruel usage of misfortune . Towards the end of the third year Father Goriot reduced his expenses still further ; he went up to the third story , and now paid forty-five francs a month . He did without snuff , told his hairdresser that he no longer required his services , and gave up wearing powder . When Goriot appeared for the first time in this condition , an exclamation of astonishment broke from his hostess at the color of his hair--a dingy olive gray . He had grown sadder day by day under the influence of some hidden trouble ; among all the faces round the table , his was the most woe-begone . There was no longer any doubt . Goriot was an elderly libertine , whose eyes had only been preserved by the skill of the physician from the malign influence of the remedies necessitated by the state of his health . The disgusting color of his hair was a result of his excesses and of the drugs which he had taken that he might continue his career . The poor old man's mental and physical condition afforded some grounds for the absurd rubbish talked about him . When his outfit was worn out , he replaced the fine linen by calico at fourteen _sous_ the ell . His diamonds , his gold snuff-box , watch-chain and trinkets , disappeared one by one . He had left off wearing the corn-flower blue coat , and was sumptuously arrayed , summer as well as winter , in a coarse chestnut-brown coat , a plush waistcoat , and doeskin breeches . He grew thinner and thinner ; his legs were shrunken , his cheeks , once so puffed out by contented bourgeois prosperity , were covered with wrinkles , and the outlines of the jawbones were distinctly visible ; there were deep furrows in his forehead . In the fourth year of his residence in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve he was no longer like his former self . The hale vermicelli manufacturer , sixty-two years of age , who had looked scarce forty , the stout , comfortable , prosperous tradesman , with an almost bucolic air , and such a brisk demeanor that it did you good to look at him ; the man with something boyish in his smile , had suddenly sunk into his dotage , and had become a feeble , vacillating septuagenarian . The keen , bright blue eyes had grown dull , and faded to a steel-gray color ; the red inflamed rims looked as though they had shed tears of blood . He excited feelings of repulsion in some , and of pity in others . The young medical students who came to the house noticed the drooping of his lower lip and the conformation of the facial angle ; and , after teasing him for some time to no purpose , they declared that cretinism was setting in . One evening after dinner Mme . Vauquer said half banteringly to him , "" So those daughters of yours do n't come to see you any more , eh ? "" meaning to imply her doubts as to his paternity ; but Father Goriot shrank as if his hostess had touched him with a sword-point . "" They come sometimes , "" he said in a tremulous voice . "" Aha ! you still see them sometimes ? "" cried the students . "" Bravo , Father Goriot ! "" The old man scarcely seemed to hear the witticisms at his expense that followed on the words ; he had relapsed into the dreamy state of mind that these superficial observers took for senile torpor , due to his lack of intelligence . If they had only known , they might have been deeply interested by the problem of his condition ; but few problems were more obscure . It was easy , of course , to find out whether Goriot had really been a vermicelli manufacturer ; the amount of his fortune was readily discoverable ; but the old people , who were most inquisitive as to his concerns , never went beyond the limits of the Quarter , and lived in the lodging-house much as oysters cling to a rock . As for the rest , the current of life in Paris daily awaited them , and swept them away with it ; so soon as they left the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve , they forgot the existence of the old man , their butt at dinner . For those narrow souls , or for careless youth , the misery in Father Goriot's withered face and its dull apathy were quite incompatible with wealth or any sort of intelligence . As for the creatures whom he called his daughters , all Mme . Vauquer's boarders were of her opinion . With the faculty for severe logic sedulously cultivated by elderly women during long evenings of gossip till they can always find an hypothesis to fit all circumstances , she was wont to reason thus : "" If Father Goriot had daughters of his own as rich as those ladies who came here seemed to be , he would not be lodging in my house , on the third floor , at forty-five francs a month ; and he would not go about dressed like a poor man . "" No objection could be raised to these inferences . So by the end of the month of November 1819 , at the time when the curtain rises on this drama , every one in the house had come to have a very decided opinion as to the poor old man . He had never had either wife or daughter ; excesses had reduced him to this sluggish condition ; he was a sort of human mollusk who should be classed among the capulidoe , so one of the dinner contingent , an _employe_ at the Museum , who had a pretty wit of his own . Poiret was an eagle , a gentleman , compared with Goriot . Poiret would join the talk , argue , answer when he was spoken to ; as a matter of fact , his talk , arguments , and responses contributed nothing to the conversation , for Poiret had a habit of repeating what the others said in different words ; still , he did join in the talk ; he was alive , and seemed capable of feeling ; while Father Goriot ( to quote the Museum official again ) was invariably at zero degrees--Reaumur . Eugene de Rastignac had just returned to Paris in a state of mind not unknown to young men who are conscious of unusual powers , and to those whose faculties are so stimulated by a difficult position , that for the time being they rise above the ordinary level . Rastignac's first year of study for the preliminary examinations in law had left him free to see the sights of Paris and to enjoy some of its amusements . A student has not much time on his hands if he sets himself to learn the repertory of every theatre , and to study the ins and outs of the labyrinth of Paris . To know its customs ; to learn the language , and become familiar with the amusements of the capital , he must explore its recesses , good and bad , follow the studies that please him best , and form some idea of the treasures contained in galleries and museums . At this stage of his career a student grows eager and excited about all sorts of follies that seem to him to be of immense importance . He has his hero , his great man , a professor at the College de France , paid to talk down to the level of his audience . He adjusts his cravat , and strikes various attitudes for the benefit of the women in the first galleries at the Opera-Comique . As he passes through all these successive initiations , and breaks out of his sheath , the horizons of life widen around him , and at length he grasps the plan of society with the different human strata of which it is composed . If he begins by admiring the procession of carriages on sunny afternoons in the Champs-Elysees , he soon reaches the further stage of envying their owners . Unconsciously , Eugene had served his apprenticeship before he went back to Angouleme for the long vacation after taking his degrees as bachelor of arts and bachelor of law . The illusions of childhood had vanished , so also had the ideas he brought with him from the provinces ; he had returned thither with an intelligence developed , with loftier ambitions , and saw things as they were at home in the old manor house . His father and mother , his two brothers and two sisters , with an aged aunt , whose whole fortune consisted in annuities , lived on the little estate of Rastignac . The whole property brought in about three thousand francs ; and though the amount varied with the season ( as must always be the case in a vine-growing district ) , they were obliged to spare an unvarying twelve hundred francs out of their income for him . He saw how constantly the poverty , which they had generously hidden from him , weighed upon them ; he could not help comparing the sisters , who had seemed so beautiful to his boyish eyes , with women in Paris , who had realized the beauty of his dreams . The uncertain future of the whole family depended upon him . It did not escape his eyes that not a crumb was wasted in the house , nor that the wine they drank was made from the second pressing ; a multitude of small things , which it is useless to speak of in detail here , made him burn to distinguish himself , and his ambition to succeed increased tenfold . He meant , like all great souls , that his success should be owing entirely to his merits ; but his was pre-eminently a southern temperament , the execution of his plans was sure to be marred by the vertigo that seizes on youth when youth sees itself alone in a wide sea , uncertain how to spend its energies , whither to steer its course , how to adapt its sails to the winds . At first he determined to fling himself heart and soul into his work , but he was diverted from this purpose by the need of society and connections ; then he saw how great an influence women exert in social life , and suddenly made up his mind to go out into this world to seek a protectress there . Surely a clever and high-spirited young man , whose wit and courage were set off to advantage by a graceful figure and the vigorous kind of beauty that readily strikes a woman's imagination , need not despair of finding a protectress . These ideas occurred to him in his country walks with his sisters , whom he had once joined so gaily . The girls thought him very much changed . His aunt , Mme . de Marcillac , had been presented at court , and had moved among the brightest heights of that lofty region . Suddenly the young man's ambition discerned in those recollections of hers , which had been like nursery fairy tales to her nephews and nieces , the elements of a social success at least as important as the success which he had achieved at the Ecole de Droit . He began to ask his aunt about those relations ; some of the old ties might still hold good . After much shaking of the branches of the family tree , the old lady came to the conclusion that of all persons who could be useful to her nephew among the selfish genus of rich relations , the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was the least likely to refuse . To this lady , therefore , she wrote in the old-fashioned style , recommending Eugene to her ; pointing out to her nephew that if he succeeded in pleasing Mme . de Beauseant , the Vicomtesse would introduce him to other relations . A few days after his return to Paris , therefore , Rastignac sent his aunt's letter to Mme . de Beauseant . The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a ball for the following evening . This was the position of affairs at the Maison Vauquer at the end of November 1819 . A few days later , after Mme . de Beauseant's ball , Eugene came in at two o ' clock in the morning . The persevering student meant to make up for the lost time by working until daylight . It was the first time that he had attempted to spend the night in this way in that silent quarter . The spell of a factitious energy was upon him ; he had beheld the pomp and splendor of the world . He had not dined at the Maison Vauquer ; the boarders probably would think that he would walk home at daybreak from the dance , as he had done sometimes on former occasions , after a fete at the Prado , or a ball at the Odeon , splashing his silk stockings thereby , and ruining his pumps . It so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before drawing the bolts of the door ; and Rastignac , coming in at that moment , could go up to his room without making any noise , followed by Christophe , who made a great deal . Eugene exchanged his dress suit for a shabby overcoat and slippers , kindled a fire with some blocks of patent fuel , and prepared for his night's work in such a sort that the faint sounds he made were drowned by Christophe's heavy tramp on the stairs . Eugene sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into his law books . He had just become aware of the fact that the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was one of the queens of fashion , that her house was thought to be the pleasantest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain . And not only so , she was , by right of her fortune , and the name she bore , one of the most conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world . Thanks to the aunt , thanks to Mme . de Marcillac's letter of introduction , the poor student had been kindly received in that house before he knew the extent of the favor thus shown to him . It was almost like a patent of nobility to be admitted to those gilded salons ; he had appeared in the most exclusive circle in Paris , and now all doors were open for him . Eugene had been dazzled at first by the brilliant assembly , and had scarcely exchanged a few words with the Vicomtesse ; he had been content to single out a goddess among this throng of Parisian divinities , one of those women who are sure to attract a young man's fancy . The Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made ; she had one of the prettiest figures in Paris . Imagine a pair of great dark eyes , a magnificently moulded hand , a shapely foot . There was a fiery energy in her movements ; the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called her "" a thoroughbred , "" "" a pure pedigree , "" these figures of speech have replaced the "" heavenly angel "" and Ossianic nomenclature ; the old mythology of love is extinct , doomed to perish by modern dandyism . But for Rastignac , Mme . Anastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had sighed . He had contrived to write his name twice upon the list of partners upon her fan , and had snatched a few words with her during the first quadrille . "" Where shall I meet you again , Madame ? "" he asked abruptly , and the tones of his voice were full of the vehement energy that women like so well . "" Oh , everywhere ! "" said she , "" in the Bois , at the Bouffons , in my own house . "" With the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper , he did all he could to cultivate an acquaintance with this lovely countess , making the best of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a waltz that she gave him . When he told her that he was a cousin of Mme . de Beauseant's , the Countess , whom he took for a great lady , asked him to call at her house , and after her parting smile , Rastignac felt convinced that he must make this visit . He was so lucky as to light upon some one who did not laugh at his ignorance , a fatal defect among the gilded and insolent youth of that period ; the coterie of Maulincourts , Maximes de Trailles , de Marsays , Ronquerolles , Ajuda-Pintos , and Vandenesses who shone there in all the glory of coxcombry among the best-dressed women of fashion in Paris--Lady Brandon , the Duchesse de Langeais , the Comtesse de Kergarouet , Mme . de Serizy , the Duchesse de Carigliano , the Comtesse Ferraud , Mme . de Lanty , the Marquise d ' Aiglemont , Mme . Firmiani , the Marquise de Listomere and the Marquise d ' Espard , the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and the Grandlieus . Luckily , therefore , for him , the novice happened upon the Marquis de Montriveau , the lover of the Duchesse de Langeais , a general as simple as a child ; from him Rastignac learned that the Comtesse lived in the Rue du Helder . Ah , what it is to be young , eager to see the world , greedily on the watch for any chance that brings you nearer the woman of your dreams , and behold two houses open their doors to you ! To set foot in the Vicomtesse de Beauseant's house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain ; to fall on your knees before a Comtesse de Restaud in the Chaussee d ' Antin ; to look at one glance across a vista of Paris drawing-rooms , conscious that , possessing sufficient good looks , you may hope to find aid and protection there in a feminine heart ! To feel ambitious enough to spurn the tight-rope on which you must walk with the steady head of an acrobat for whom a fall is impossible , and to find in a charming woman the best of all balancing poles . He sat there with his thoughts for a while , Law on the one hand , and Poverty on the other , beholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above the dull , smouldering fire . Who would not have paused and questioned the future as Eugene was doing ? who would not have pictured it full of success ? His wondering thoughts took wings ; he was transported out of the present into that blissful future ; he was sitting by Mme . de Restaud's side , when a sort of sigh , like the grunt of an overburdened St. Joseph , broke the silence of the night . It vibrated through the student , who took the sound for a death groan . He opened his door noiselessly , went out upon the landing , and saw a thin streak of light under Father Goriot's door . Eugene feared that his neighbor had been taken ill ; he went over and looked through the keyhole ; the old man was busily engaged in an occupation so singular and so suspicious that Rastignac thought he was only doing a piece of necessary service to society to watch the self-styled vermicelli maker's nocturnal industries . The table was upturned , and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a silver plate and cup to the bar before knotting a thick rope round them ; he was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that they were being crushed and twisted out of shape ; to all appearance he meant to convert the richly wrought metal into ingots . "" _Peste ! _ what a man ! "" said Rastignac , as he watched Goriot's muscular arms ; there was not a sound in the room while the old man , with the aid of the rope , was kneading the silver like dough . "" Was he then , indeed , a thief , or a receiver of stolen goods , who affected imbecility and decrepitude , and lived like a beggar that he might carry on his pursuits the more securely ? "" Eugene stood for a moment revolving these questions , then he looked again through the keyhole . Father Goriot had unwound his coil of rope ; he had covered the table with a blanket , and was now employed in rolling the flattened mass of silver into a bar , an operation which he performed with marvelous dexterity . "" Why , he must be as strong as Augustus , King of Poland ! "" said Eugene to himself when the bar was nearly finished . Father Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork , tears fell from his eyes , he blew out the dip which had served him for a light while he manipulated the silver , and Eugene heard him sigh as he lay down again . "" He is mad , "" thought the student . "" _Poor child ! _ "" Father Goriot said aloud . Rastignac , hearing those words , concluded to keep silence ; he would not hastily condemn his neighbor . He was just in the doorway of his room when a strange sound from the staircase below reached his ears ; it might have been made by two men coming up in list slippers . Eugene listened ; two men there certainly were , he could hear their breathing . Yet there had been no sound of opening the street door , no footsteps in the passage . Suddenly , too , he saw a faint gleam of light on the second story ; it came from M. Vautrin's room . "" There are a good many mysteries here for a lodging-house ! "" he said to himself . He went part of the way downstairs and listened again . The rattle of gold reached his ears . In another moment the light was put out , and again he distinctly heard the breathing of two men , but no sound of a door being opened or shut . The two men went downstairs , the faint sounds growing fainter as they went . "" Who is there ? "" cried Mme . Vauquer out of her bedroom window . "" I , Mme . Vauquer , "" answered Vautrin's deep bass voice . "" I am coming in . "" "" That is odd ! Christophe drew the bolts , "" said Eugene , going back to his room . "" You have to sit up at night , it seems , if you really mean to know all that is going on about you in Paris . "" These incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams ; he betook himself to his work , but his thought wandered back to Father Goriot's suspicious occupation ; Mme . de Restaud's face swam again and again before his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future ; and at last he lay down and slept with clenched fists . When a young man makes up his mind that he will work all night , the chances are that seven times out of ten he will sleep till morning . Such vigils do not begin before we are turned twenty . The next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw the most punctual people out in their calculations as to the time ; even the most business-like folk fail to keep their appointments in such weather , and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is eight o ' clock . On this morning it was half-past nine , and Mme . Vauquer still lay abed . Christophe was late , Sylvie was late , but the two sat comfortably taking their coffee as usual . It was Sylvie's custom to take the cream off the milk destined for the boarders' breakfast for her own , and to boil the remainder for some time , so that madame should not discover this illegal exaction . "" Sylvie , "" said Christophe , as he dipped a piece of toast into the coffee , "" M. Vautrin , who is not such a bad sort , all the same , had two people come to see him again last night . If madame says anything , mind you say nothing about it . "" "" Has he given you something ? "" "" He gave me a five-franc piece this month , which is as good as saying , ' Hold your tongue . ' "" "" Except him and Mme . Couture , who does n ' t look twice at every penny , there 's no one in the house that does n ' t try to get back with the left hand all that they give with the right at New Year , "" said Sylvie . "" And , after all , "" said Christophe , "" what do they give you ? A miserable five-franc piece . There is Father Goriot , who has cleaned his shoes himself these two years past . There is that old beggar Poiret , who goes without blacking altogether ; he would sooner drink it than put it on his boots . Then there is that whipper-snapper of a student , who gives me a couple of francs . Two francs will not pay for my brushes , and he sells his old clothes , and gets more for them than they are worth . Oh ! they 're a shabby lot ! "" "" Pooh ! "" said Sylvie , sipping her coffee , "" our places are the best in the Quarter , that I know . But about that great big chap Vautrin , Christophe ; has any one told you anything about him ? "" "" Yes . I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago ; he said to me , ' There 's a gentleman in your place , is n't there ? a tall man that dyes his whiskers ? ' I told him , ' No , sir ; they are n ' t dyed . A gay fellow like him has n ' t the time to do it . ' And when I told M. Vautrin about it afterwards , he said , ' Quite right , my boy . That is the way to answer them . There is nothing more unpleasant than to have your little weaknesses known ; it might spoil many a match . ' "" "" Well , and for my part , "" said Sylvie , "" a man tried to humbug me at the market wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt . Such bosh ! There , "" she cried , interrupting herself , "" that 's a quarter to ten striking at the Val-de-Grace , and not a soul stirring ! "" "" Pooh ! they are all gone out . Mme . Couture and the girl went out at eight o ' clock to take the wafer at Saint-Etienne . Father Goriot started off somewhere with a parcel , and the student wo n ' t be back from his lecture till ten o ' clock . I saw them go while I was sweeping the stairs ; Father Goriot knocked up against me , and his parcel was as hard as iron . What is the old fellow up to , I wonder ? He is as good as a plaything for the rest of them ; they can never let him alone ; but he is a good man , all the same , and worth more than all of them put together . He does n ' t give you much himself , but he sometimes sends you with a message to ladies who fork out famous tips ; they are dressed grandly , too . "" "" His daughters , as he calls them , eh ? There are a dozen of them . "" "" I have never been to more than two--the two who came here . "" "" There is madame moving overhead ; I shall have to go , or she will raise a fine racket . Just keep an eye on the milk , Christophe ; do n't let the cat get at it . "" Sylvie went up to her mistress' room . "" Sylvie ! How is this ? It 's nearly ten o ' clock , and you let me sleep like a dormouse ! Such a thing has never happened before . "" "" It 's the fog ; it is that thick , you could cut it with a knife . "" "" But how about breakfast ? "" "" Bah ! the boarders are possessed , I 'm sure . They all cleared out before there was a wink of daylight . "" "" Do speak properly , Sylvie , "" Mme . Vauquer retorted ; "" say a blink of daylight . "" "" Ah , well , madame , whichever you please . Anyhow , you can have breakfast at ten o ' clock . La Michonnette and Poiret have neither of them stirred . There are only those two upstairs , and they are sleeping like the logs they are . "" "" But , Sylvie , you put their names together as if ---- "" "" As if what ? "" said Sylvie , bursting into a guffaw . "" The two of them make a pair . "" "" It is a strange thing , is n't it , Sylvie , how M. Vautrin got in last night after Christophe had bolted the door ? "" "" Not at all , madame . Christophe heard M. Vautrin , and went down and undid the door . And here are you imagining that ---- ? "" "" Give me my bodice , and be quick and get breakfast ready . Dish up the rest of the mutton with the potatoes , and you can put the stewed pears on the table , those at five a penny . "" A few moments later Mme . Vauquer came down , just in time to see the cat knock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk , and begin to lap in all haste . "" Mistigris ! "" she cried . The cat fled , but promptly returned to rub against her ankles . "" Oh ! yes , you can wheedle , you old hypocrite ! "" she said . "" Sylvie ! Sylvie ! "" "" Yes , madame ; what is it ? "" "" Just see what the cat has done ! "" "" It is all that stupid Christophe's fault . I told him to stop and lay the table . What has become of him ? Do n't you worry , madame ; Father Goriot shall have it . I will fill it up with water , and he wo n ' t know the difference ; he never notices anything , not even what he eats . "" "" I wonder where the old heathen can have gone ? "" said Mme . Vauquer , setting the plates round the table . "" Who knows ? He is up to all sorts of tricks . "" "" I have overslept myself , "" said Mme . Vauquer . "" But madame looks as fresh as a rose , all the same . "" The door bell rang at that moment , and Vautrin came through the sitting-room , singing loudly : "" ' Tis the same old story everywhere , A roving heart and a roving glance .. "" Oh ! Mamma Vauquer ! good-morning ! "" he cried at the sight of his hostess , and he put his arm gaily round her waist . "" There ! have done ---- "" "" ' Impertinence ! ' Say it ! "" he answered . "" Come , say it ! Now , is n't that what you really mean ? Stop a bit , I will help you to set the table . Ah ! I am a nice man , am I not ? "" For the locks of brown and the golden hair A sighing lover ... "" Oh ! I have just seen something so funny ---- .... led by chance . "" "" What ? "" asked the widow . "" Father Goriot in the goldsmith's shop in the Rue Dauphine at half-past eight this morning . They buy old spoons and forks and gold lace there , and Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round sum . It had been twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that 's not used to the trade . "" "" Really ? You do n't say so ? "" "" Yes . One of my friends is expatriating himself ; I had been to see him off on board the Royal Mail steamer , and was coming back here . I waited after that to see what Father Goriot would do ; it is a comical affair . He came back to this quarter of the world , to the Rue des Gres , and went into a money-lender's house ; everybody knows him , Gobseck , a stuck-up rascal , that would make dominoes out of his father's bones , a Turk , a heathen , an old Jew , a Greek ; it would be a difficult matter to rob _him_ , for he puts all his coin into the Bank . "" "" Then what was Father Goriot doing there ? "" "" Doing ? "" said Vautrin . "" Nothing ; he was bent on his own undoing . He is a simpleton , stupid enough to ruin himself by running after ---- "" "" There he is ! "" cried Sylvie . "" Christophe , "" cried Father Goriot's voice , "" come upstairs with me . "" Christophe went up , and shortly afterwards came down again . "" Where are you going ? "" Mme . Vauquer asked of her servant . "" Out on an errand for M. Goriot . "" "" What may that be ? "" said Vautrin , pouncing on a letter in Christophe's hand . "" _Mme . la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud_ , "" he read . "" Where are you going with it ? "" he added , as he gave the letter back to Christophe . "" To the Rue du Helder . I have orders to give this into her hands myself . "" "" What is there inside it ? "" said Vautrin , holding the letter up to the light . "" A banknote ? No. "" He peered into the envelope . "" A receipted account ! "" he cried . "" My word ! ' tis a gallant old dotard . Off with you , old chap , "" he said , bringing down a hand on Christophe's head , and spinning the man round like a thimble ; "" you will have a famous tip . "" By this time the table was set . Sylvie was boiling the milk , Mme . Vauquer was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from Vautrin , who kept humming to himself : "" The same old story everywhere , A roving heart and a roving glance . "" When everything was ready , Mme . Couture and Mlle . Taillefer came in . "" Where have you been this morning , fair lady ? "" said Mme . Vauquer , turning to Mme . Couture . "" We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-Etienne du Mont. To-day is the day when we must go to see M. Taillefer . Poor little thing ! She is trembling like a leaf , "" Mme . Couture went on , as she seated herself before the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze . "" Warm yourself , Victorine , "" said Mme . Vauquer . "" It is quite right and proper , mademoiselle , to pray to Heaven to soften your father's heart , "" said Vautrin , as he drew a chair nearer to the orphan girl ; "" but that is not enough . What you want is a friend who will give the monster a piece of his mind ; a barbarian that has three millions ( so they say ) , and will not give you a dowry ; and a pretty girl needs a dowry nowadays . "" "" Poor child ! "" said Mme . Vauquer . "" Never mind , my pet , your wretch of a father is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself . "" Victorine's eyes filled with tears at the words , and the widow checked herself at a sign from Mme . Couture . "" If we could only see him ! "" said the Commissary-General's widow ; "" if I could speak to him myself and give him his wife's last letter ! I have never dared to run the risk of sending it by post ; he knew my handwriting ---- "" "" ' Oh woman , persecuted and injured innocent ! ' "" exclaimed Vautrin , breaking in upon her . "" So that is how you are , is it ? In a few days' time I will look into your affairs , and it will be all right , you shall see . "" "" Oh ! sir , "" said Victorine , with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin , who showed no sign of being touched by it , "" if you know of any way of communicating with my father , please be sure and tell him that his affection and my mother's honor are more to me than all the money in the world . If you can induce him to relent a little towards me , I will pray to God for you . You may be sure of my gratitude ---- "" "" _The same old story everywhere_ , "" sang Vautrin , with a satirical intonation . At this juncture , Goriot , Mlle . Michonneau , and Poiret came downstairs together ; possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie was making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast . The seven people thus assembled bade each other good-morning , and took their places at the table ; the clock struck ten , and the student's footstep was heard outside . "" Ah ! here you are , M. Eugene , "" said Sylvie ; "" every one is breakfasting at home to-day . "" The student exchanged greetings with the lodgers , and sat down beside Goriot . "" I have just met with a queer adventure , "" he said , as he helped himself abundantly to the mutton , and cut a slice of bread , which Mme . Vauquer's eyes gauged as usual . "" An adventure ? "" queried Poiret . "" Well , and what is there to astonish you in that , old boy ? "" Vautrin asked of Poiret . "" M. Eugene is cut out for that kind of thing . "" Mlle . Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student . "" Tell us about your adventure ! "" demanded M. Vautrin . "" Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine , the Vicomtesse de Beauseant . She has a magnificent house ; the rooms are hung with silk--in short , it was a splendid affair , and I was as happy as a king --- "" "" Fisher , "" put in Vautrin , interrupting . "" What do you mean , sir ? "" said Eugene sharply . "" I said ' fisher , ' because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than kings . "" "" Quite true ; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a king , "" said Poiret the ditto-ist , "" because ---- "" "" In fact "" -- the law-student cut him short -- "" I danced with one of the handsomest women in the room , a charming countess , the most exquisite creature I have ever seen . There was peach blossom in her hair , and she had the loveliest bouquet of flowers--real flowers , that scented the air----but there ! it is no use trying to describe a woman glowing with the dance . You ought to have seen her ! Well , and this morning I met this divine countess about nine o ' clock , on foot in the Rue de Gres . Oh ! how my heart beat ! I began to think ---- "" "" That she was coming here , "" said Vautrin , with a keen look at the student . "" I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck , a money-lender . If ever you explore a Parisian woman's heart , you will find the money-lender first , and the lover afterwards . Your countess is called Anastasie de Restaud , and she lives in the Rue du Helder . "" The student stared hard at Vautrin . Father Goriot raised his head at the words , and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence and uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment . "" Then Christophe was too late , and she must have gone to him ! "" cried Goriot , with anguish in his voice . "" It is just as I guessed , "" said Vautrin , leaning over to whisper in Mme . Vauquer's ear . Goriot went on with his breakfast , but seemed unconscious of what he was doing . He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his own thoughts than he did at that moment . "" Who the devil could have told you her name , M. Vautrin ? "" asked Eugene . "" Aha ! there you are ! "" answered Vautrin . "" Old Father Goriot there knew it quite well ! and why should I not know it too ? "" "" M. Goriot ? "" the student cried . "" What is it ? "" asked the old man . "" So she was very beautiful , was she , yesterday night ? "" "" Who ? "" "" Mme . de Restaud . "" "" Look at the old wretch , "" said Mme . Vauquer , speaking to Vautrin ; "" how his eyes light up ! "" "" Then does he really keep her ? "" said Mlle . Michonneau , in a whisper to the student . "" Oh ! yes , she was tremendously pretty , "" Eugene answered . Father Goriot watched him with eager eyes . "" If Mme . de Beauseant had not been there , my divine countess would have been the queen of the ball ; none of the younger men had eyes for any one else . I was the twelfth on her list , and she danced every quadrille . The other women were furious . She must have enjoyed herself , if ever creature did ! It is a true saying that there is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail , a galloping horse , or a woman dancing . "" "" So the wheel turns , "" said Vautrin ; "" yesterday night at a duchess' ball , this morning in a money-lender's office , on the lowest rung of the ladder--just like a Parisienne ! If their husbands can not afford to pay for their frantic extravagance , they will sell themselves . Or if they can not do that , they will tear out their mothers' hearts to find something to pay for their splendor . They will turn the world upside down . Just a Parisienne through and through ! "" Father Goriot's face , which had shone at the student's words like the sun on a bright day , clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of Vautrin's . "" Well , "" said Mme . Vauquer , "" but where is your adventure ? Did you speak to her ? Did you ask her if she wanted to study law ? "" "" She did not see me , "" said Eugene . "" But only think of meeting one of the prettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Gres at nine o ' clock ! She could not have reached home after the ball till two o ' clock this morning . Was n ' t it queer ? There is no place like Paris for this sort of adventures . "" "" Pshaw ! much funnier things than _that_ happen here ! "" exclaimed Vautrin . Mlle . Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk , she was so absorbed by the thought of the new attempt that she was about to make . Mme . Couture made a sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress ; the two ladies went out , and Father Goriot followed their example . "" Well , did you see ? "" said Mme . Vauquer , addressing Vautrin and the rest of the circle . "" He is ruining himself for those women , that is plain . "" "" Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de Restaud is anything to Father Goriot , "" cried the student . "" Well , and if you do n't , "" broke in Vautrin , "" we are not set on convincing you . You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet ; later on you will find out that there are what we call men with a passion ---- "" Mlle . Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words . They seemed to be like the sound of a trumpet to a trooper's horse . "" Aha ! "" said Vautrin , stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance , "" so we have had our little experiences , have we ? "" The old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue . "" Well , "" he went on , "" when folk of that kind get a notion into their heads , they can not drop it . They must drink the water from some particular spring--it is stagnant as often as not ; but they will sell their wives and families , they will sell their own souls to the devil to get it . For some this spring is play , or the stock-exchange , or music , or a collection of pictures or insects ; for others it is some woman who can give them the dainties they like . You might offer these last all the women on earth--they would turn up their noses ; they will have the only one who can gratify their passion . It often happens that the woman does not care for them at all , and treats them cruelly ; they buy their morsels of satisfaction very dear ; but no matter , the fools are never tired of it ; they will take their last blanket to the pawnbroker 's to give their last five-franc piece to her . Father Goriot here is one of that sort . He is discreet , so the Countess exploits him--just the way of the gay world . The poor old fellow thinks of her and of nothing else . In all other respects you see he is a stupid animal ; but get him on that subject , and his eyes sparkle like diamonds . That secret is not difficult to guess . He took some plate himself this morning to the melting-pot , and I saw him at Daddy Gobseck's in the Rue des Gres . And now , mark what follows--he came back here , and gave a letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that noodle of a Christophe , who showed us the address ; there was a receipted bill inside it . It is clear that it was an urgent matter if the Countess also went herself to the old money lender . Father Goriot has financed her handsomely . There is no need to tack a tale together ; the thing is self-evident . So that shows you , sir student , that all the time your Countess was smiling , dancing , flirting , swaying her peach-flower crowned head , with her gown gathered into her hand , her slippers were pinching her , as they say ; she was thinking of her protested bills , or her lover's protested bills . "" "" You have made me wild to know the truth , "" cried Eugene ; "" I will go to call on Mme . de Restaud to-morrow . "" "" Yes , "" echoed Poiret ; "" you must go and call on Mme . de Restaud . "" "" And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there , who will take payment for the assistance he politely rendered . "" Eugene looked disgusted . "" Why , then , this Paris of yours is a slough . "" "" And an uncommonly queer slough , too , "" replied Vautrin . "" The mud splashes you as you drive through it in your carriage--you are a respectable person ; you go afoot and are splashed--you are a scoundrel . You are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other belonging to somebody else , and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the Place du Palais-de-Justice ; you steal a million , and you are pointed out in every salon as a model of virtue . And you pay thirty millions for the police and the courts of justice , for the maintenance of law and order ! A pretty slate of things it is ! "" "" What , "" cried Mme . Vauquer , "" has Father Goriot really melted down his silver posset-dish ? "" "" There were two turtle-doves on the lid , were there not ? "" asked Eugene . "" Yes , that there were . "" "" Then , was he fond of it ? "" said Eugene . "" He cried while he was breaking up the cup and plate . I happened to see him by accident . "" "" It was dear to him as his own life , "" answered the widow . "" There ! you see how infatuated the old fellow is ! "" cried Vautrin . "" The woman yonder can coax the soul out of him . "" The student went up to his room . Vautrin went out , and a few moments later Mme . Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had called for them . Poiret gave his arm to Mlle . Michonneau , and they went together to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin des Plantes . "" Well , those two are as good as married , "" was the portly Sylvie's comment . "" They are going out together to-day for the first time . They are such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against each other they will draw sparks like flint and steel . "" "" Keep clear of Mlle . Michonneau's shawl , then , "" said Mme . Vauquer , laughing ; "" it would flare up like tinder . "" At four o ' clock that evening , when Goriot came in , he saw , by the light of two smoky lamps , that Victorine's eyes were red . Mme . Vauquer was listening to the history of the visit made that morning to M. Taillefer ; it had been made in vain . Taillefer was tired of the annual application made by his daughter and her elderly friend ; he gave them a personal interview in order to arrive at an understanding with them . "" My dear lady , "" said Mme . Couture , addressing Mme . Vauquer , "" just imagine it ; he did not even ask Victorine to sit down , she was standing the whole time . He said to me quite coolly , without putting himself in a passion , that we might spare ourselves the trouble of going there ; that the young lady ( he would not call her his daughter ) was injuring her cause by importuning him ( _importuning ! _ once a year , the wretch ! ) ; that as Victorine's mother had nothing when he married her , Victorine ought not to expect anything from him ; in fact , he said the most cruel things , that made the poor child burst out crying . The little thing threw herself at her father's feet and spoke up bravely ; she said that she only persevered in her visits for her mother's sake ; that she would obey him without a murmur , but that she begged him to read her poor dead mother's farewell letter . She took it up and gave it to him , saying the most beautiful things in the world , most beautifully expressed ; I do not know where she learned them ; God must have put them into her head , for the poor child was inspired to speak so nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her talk . And what do you think the monster was doing all the time ? Cutting his nails ! He took the letter that poor Mme . Taillefer had soaked with tears , and flung it on to the chimney-piece . ' That is all right , ' he said . He held out his hands to raise his daughter , but she covered them with kisses , and he drew them away again . Scandalous , is n't it ? And his great booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister . "" "" What inhuman wretches they must be ! "" said Father Goriot . "" And then they both went out of the room , "" Mme . Couture went on , without heeding the worthy vermicelli maker's exclamation ; "" father and son bowed to me , and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent business ! That is the history of our call . Well , he has seen his daughter at any rate . How he can refuse to acknowledge her I can not think , for they are as alike as two peas . "" The boarders dropped in one after another , interchanging greetings and empty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and witty . Dulness is their prevailing ingredient , and the whole point consists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture . This kind of argot is always changing . The essence of the jest consists in some catchword suggested by a political event , an incident in the police courts , a street song , or a bit of burlesque at some theatre , and forgotten in a month . Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore and shuttlecock with words and ideas . The diorama , a recent invention , which carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas , had given rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with _rama_ . The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist among the boarders . "" Well , Monsieur-r-r Poiret , "" said the _employe_ from the Museum , "" how is your health-orama ? "" Then , without waiting for an answer , he turned to Mme . Couture and Victorine with a "" Ladies , you seem melancholy . "" "" Is dinner ready ? "" cried Horace Bianchon , a medical student , and a friend of Rastignac's ; "" my stomach is sinking _usque ad talones_ . "" "" There is an uncommon _frozerama_ outside , "" said Vautrin . "" Make room there , Father Goriot ! Confound it , your foot covers the whole front of the stove . "" "" Illustrious M. Vautrin , "" put in Bianchon , "" why do you say _frozerama_ ? It is incorrect ; it should be _frozenrama_ . "" "" No , it should n ' t , "" said the official from the Museum ; "" _frozerama_ is right by the same rule that you say ' My feet are _froze_ . ' "" "" Ah ! ah ! "" "" Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac , Doctor of the Law of Contraries , "" cried Bianchon , seizing Eugene by the throat , and almost throttling him . "" Hallo there ! hallo ! "" Mlle . Michonneau came noiselessly in , bowed to the rest of the party , and took her place beside the three women without saying a word . "" That old bat always makes me shudder , "" said Bianchon in a low voice , indicating Mlle . Michonneau to Vautrin . "" I have studied Gall's system , and I am sure she has the bump of Judas . "" "" Then you have seen a case before ? "" said Vautrin . "" Who has not ? "" answered Bianchon . "" Upon my word , that ghastly old maid looks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through , give them time enough . "" "" That is the way , young man , "" returned he of the forty years and the dyed whiskers : "" The rose has lived the life of a rose -- A morning's space . "" "" Aha ! here is a magnificent _soupe-au-rama_ , "" cried Poiret as Christophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed . "" I beg your pardon , sir , "" said Mme . Vauquer ; "" it is _soupe aux choux_ . "" All the young men roared with laughter . "" Had you there , Poiret ! "" "" Poir-r-r-rette ! she had you there ! "" "" Score two points to Mamma Vauquer , "" said Vautrin . "" Did any of you notice the fog this morning ? "" asked the official . "" It was a frantic fog , "" said Bianchon , "" a fog unparalleled , doleful , melancholy , sea-green , asthmatical--a Goriot of a fog ! "" "" A Goriorama , "" said the art student , "" because you could n ' t see a thing in it . "" "" Hey ! Milord Gaoriotte , they air talking about yoo-o-ou ! "" Father Goriot , seated at the lower end of the table , close to the door through which the servant entered , raised his face ; he had smelt at a scrap of bread that lay under his table napkin , an old trick acquired in his commercial capacity , that still showed itself at times . "" Well , "" Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones , that rang above the rattle of spoons and plates and the sound of other voices , "" and is there anything the matter with the bread ? "" "" Nothing whatever , madame , "" he answered ; "" on the contrary , it is made of the best quality of corn ; flour from Etampes . "" "" How could you tell ? "" asked Eugene . "" By the color , by the flavor . "" "" You knew the flavor by the smell , I suppose , "" said Mme . Vauquer . "" You have grown so economical , you will find out how to live on the smell of cooking at last . "" "" Take out a patent for it , then , "" cried the Museum official ; "" you would make a handsome fortune . "" "" Never mind him , "" said the artist ; "" he does that sort of thing to delude us into thinking that he was a vermicelli maker . "" "" Your nose is a corn-sampler , it appears ? "" inquired the official . "" Corn _what_ ? "" asked Bianchon . "" Corn-el . "" "" Corn-et . "" "" Corn-elian . "" "" Corn-ice . "" "" Corn-ucopia . "" "" Corn-crake . "" "" Corn-cockle . "" "" Corn-orama . "" The eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the room , and the laughter that followed was the more uproarious because poor Father Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look , like a foreigner trying to catch the meaning of words in a language which he does not understand . "" Corn ? ... "" he said , turning to Vautrin , his next neighbor . "" Corn on your foot , old man ! "" said Vautrin , and he drove Father Goriot's cap down over his eyes by a blow on the crown . The poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too bewildered to do anything . Christophe carried off his plate , thinking that he had finished his soup , so that when Goriot had pushed back his cap from his eyes his spoon encountered the table . Every one burst out laughing . "" You are a disagreeable joker , sir , "" said the old man , "" and if you take any further liberties with me ---- "" "" Well , what then , old boy ? "" Vautrin interrupted . "" Well , then , you shall pay dearly for it some day ---- "" "" Down below , eh ? "" said the artist , "" in the little dark corner where they put naughty boys . "" "" Well , mademoiselle , "" Vautrin said , turning to Victorine , "" you are eating nothing . So papa was refractory , was he ? "" "" A monster ! "" said Mme . Couture . "" Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit ; she is not eating anything . Eh ! eh ! just see how Father Goriot is staring at Mlle . Victorine . "" The old man had forgotten his dinner , he was so absorbed in gazing at the poor girl ; the sorrow in her face was unmistakable , -- the slighted love of a child whose father would not recognize her . "" We are mistaken about Father Goriot , my dear boy , "" said Eugene in a low voice . "" He is not an idiot , nor wanting in energy . Try your Gall system on him , and let me know what you think . I saw him crush a silver dish last night as if it had been made of wax ; there seems to be something extraordinary going on in his mind just now , to judge by his face . His life is so mysterious that it must be worth studying . Oh ! you may laugh , Bianchon ; I am not joking . "" "" The man is a subject , is he ? "" said Bianchon ; "" all right ! I will dissect him , if he will give me the chance . "" "" No ; feel his bumps . "" "" Hm ! -- his stupidity might perhaps be contagious . """	6

811	The wind has great power as we have all experienced on particularly windy days . It can be very destructive , ripping off roofs and toppling trees , as during hurricanes and storms . But this power can be harnessed more benevolently to generate electricity . Wind turbines use the power in the wind to drive large aerodynamic blades , similar to helicopter blades , these blades turn a generator , which generates electricity . The amount of electricity generated is related to the strength of the wind , so the stronger the wind the more electricity is generated . Wind is a clean form of electricity generation , it requires no fuel at all . So once a wind generator is operational it has very low running costs . There are draw backs , the wind does not blow all of the time , so sometimes it is not possible to generate . This intermittency of electricity supply means that there has to be a backup electricity generation capacity in the system . Wind can be used at small as well as large scale and can be sited almost anywhere , depending upon the size of the installation . Larger turbines do require open space with uninterrupted wind , but small turbines can be roof mounted or placed near a building . Large scale wind can generate at close to current market price for electricity and is cheaper than some conventional fuels .	4

1138	Once Jon got his license , he began to autocross and do track days with a 1999 Honda Prelude Type SH , and then with a 1994 Mazda RX-7 R2 . After college , he joined Autoweek Magazine for 10 years reviewing and track testing cars . He 's also an avid motorsports fan who follows the Pirelli World Challenge , IndyCar and Formula One . In addition to the Prelude and RX-7 , Jon has a 2008 Honda S2000 CR and hopes to add an Acura NSX to the stable one day . See full bio Mitsubishi saves the best Lancer Evolution for last Roadshow Editors' Rating 6.2 Overall Performance 8 Features 5 Design 7 Media & Connectivity 4 The Good Mitsubishi gives a proper sendoff to the Lancer Evolution by making the Final Edition the most powerful and track-worthy production model ever . The Bad Away from the circuit , the Evolution remains difficult to live with on a daily basis , terrible on-road comfort and a dated cabin devoid of modern infotainment and safety tech . The Bottom Line Mitsubishi's Lancer Evolution is a throwback performance sedan best appreciated by hardcore enthusiasts . Mitsubishi saves the best Lancer Evolution for last The Final Edition sends the Evo out on a high note with more power and exclusive styling touches . by Jon Wong Close Drag I knew this day was coming . My last hurrah in a new Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution before it disappears from showrooms . The Japanese carmaker said this generation of the Evolution , its tenth , would be the last . For sport-compact car enthusiasts who thought that the announcement may have just been a cruel joke , the release of this special Final Edition model is proof positive that the end of Mitsubishi's rally-bred high-performance sedan has become reality . Losing the Evo bums me out even though I 've never been a huge fan of the current model . I love the Evolution IX for its emotion-rich drive character , gonzo performance and fitting boy-racer looks , yet in all my experiences with the Evo X -- mostly in MR trims with a not-so-great dual-clutch transmission -- it never quite spoke to me like its predecessor . Am I missing something about the Evo X ? I 'm using this last go with a five-speed-manual-equipped Final Edition to find out by taking it on a short road trip and to the race track . Maybe I 'll finally come to terms with this last Evo ? Or maybe I 'll still be disappointed and continue my casual search for good-condition Evo IX for my own garage . On-road brutality The drone from the drivetrain churning at 3,500 rpm in fifth gear on the expressway is headache inducing , explaining my florescent orange ear plugs as I head west across Michigan . Things like sound insulation and acoustic glass are n't always high on the requirements list for a no-nonsense performance car . Road , wind and drivetrain racket whirls constantly in the cabin making the 180-mile run to South Haven , Michigan , far from delightful . Turning up tunes on the six-speaker audio system to mask the unpleasant noises is one option . The 6 . 1-inch center infotainment touchscreen gives access to satellite radio and Bluetooth audio and phone streaming , but not much else . There 's no navigation , Apple CarPlay or Android Auto in the Final Edition , meaning techies will likely continue to be disappointed with this Evolution in that respect . How about safety tech such as automatic emergency braking , adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assistant systems ? Sorry , you wo n't find anything like that in the Evo , either . It 's too old -- in fact , you 'll note that this car wears a 2015 model year -- that 's not a misprint , Mitsubishi held over a particularly long model year to see this one through . Red accent stitching highlights the Lancer Evolution Final Edition's cabin . Nick Miotke / Roadshow Those looking for ride comfort and interior quality also need not apply . The noisy 18-inch Yokohama Advan A13 tires have cement-like sidewalls that yield a rough-and-tumble ride quality . If you 're expecting the suspension with Bilstein shock absorbers and Eibach springs to provide some damping relief , think again . There 's little give , meaning impacts from even small ruts transmit into the cabin and up your spinal cord . Since its 2008 launch , the Evo's interior has undergone a string of minor improvements . The center multi-information display is now color instead of all red , chrome accents dress the environment up some , and soft-touch upper door trims help break-up the acres of hard plastic up front . It 's a cabin that does n't look too out of place in an $ 18 , 000 compact economy sedan , but likely will disappoint many in a $ 39 , 000 machine . Got wing ? Even without a show-stopping interior , there 's no denying that the Evolution Final Edition looks the part on the outside . An aggressive front end , vented hood , wider front fenders and trademark shopping-cart rear wing are direct links to the car's World Rally Championship roots when driver Tommi Mäkinen notched four consecutive titles piloting Evolutions in the late 1990s . Some small styling alterations do set the Final Edition apart from regular Evos , with the most notable alteration being the black roof panel that contrasts nicely with this car's Diamond White paint . A black center bumper , hood vents , dark chrome grille trim and Enkei wheels complete the Final Edition touches outside . Even the spartan interior gets some Final Edition love , with red accent stitching , black headliner , sun visors , pillar trim and a numbered center console plaque denoting each car's place within the 1 , 600-unit limited-edition series . Disappointingly , the Recaro sport seats offered on some Evo models are n't part of this Final Edition package . While the basic chairs are comfortable and have respectable side bolstering , they do n't look like they belong in a model that is serving as the swan song to a noteworthy performance model .	5

Nature of problem : The program calculates elastic scattering differential cross sections , probabilities , and cross sections for inelastic scattering in nuclear collisions at intermediate and high energies ( Elab > = 50 MeV / nucleon ) . It is particularly useful in the analysis of experiments with stable and unstable nuclear beams running at several intermediate-energy heavy ion accelerators around the world . Solution method : Eikonal wavefunctions are used for the scattering . For each "" impact parameter "" entering the scattering matrix elements , one solves coupled-channels equations for the time dependent Coulomb + nuclear field expanded into multipoles . A four-point Runge-Kutta procedure is used to solve the coupled-channels equations . The elastic scattering is calculated purely with the eikonal approximation . The coupled-channels is a separate calculation for the inelastic amplitudes . The inelastic couplings , therefore , have no effect on the obtained elastic scattering cross sections . Running time : Almost all the CPU time is consumed by the solution of the coupled-channels equations . It is about 2 min on a 1GHz Intel P4-processor machine for the inclusion of 5 nuclear states ."	3

Cannabis and cannabis based medicines Potential benefits and risks to health A report of the findings of the working party has been published by The Royal College of Physicians - December 2005 The illegality of cannabis in many countries has perhaps obscured proper examination of cannabis-based medicines in clinical practice . On the one hand , many sufferers from multiple sclerosis testify to its efficacy in relieving pain and spasticity , while others have serious concerns about its ability to cause dependence and possibly lead to harder drugs . This report takes an objective and careful look at the evidence on cannabis-based medicines . Their ability to treat conditions such as multiple sclerosis and chronic pain , to reduce the sickness caused by chemotherapy , and to counteract the loss of appetite in AIDS patients , is examined . Each is considered in the light of the pharmacological effect of cannabinoids , their efficacy in comparison to other medicines , and the results of clinical trials . Their efficacy in treating a range of other conditions is also assessed , along with their overall safety , including the possible link between cannabis and psychosis . The fact that the body produces its own cannabis-like substance has raised interesting new possibilities for research into drugs for the treatment of obesity , heart disease and osteoporosis . With a clear patient information section , the report provides an informative guide in a contentious area of medicine for general practitioners , hospital doctors , psychiatrists and patients suffering from multiple sclerosis .

8	"Exchange Rate Disorder NEW YORK – Two troubling features of the ongoing economic recovery are the depressed nature of world trade and the early revival of international global payment imbalances . Estimates by the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations indicate that the volume of international trade in 2010 will still be 7 % to 8 % below its 2008 peak , while many or most countries , including industrial nations , are seeking to boost their current accounts . Indeed , if we believe the IMF's projections , the world economy 's accumulated current-account surpluses would increase by almost $ 1 trillion between 2009 and 2012 ! This is , of course , impossible , as surpluses and deficits must be in balance for the world economy as a whole . It simply reflects the recessionary ( or deflationary ) force of weak global demand hanging over the world economy . Under these conditions , export-led growth by major economies is a threat to the world economy . This is true for China , Germany ( as French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde has consistently reminded her neighbor ) , Japan , and the United States . Countries running surpluses must adopt expansionary policies and appreciate their currencies . More broadly , to the extent that major emerging-market countries will continue to lead the global recovery , they should reduce their current-account surpluses or even generate deficits to help , through increased imports , spread the benefits of their growth worldwide . But , while that implies that emerging-market currencies must strengthen , disorderly appreciations would do more harm than good . To use an American saying , it might mean throwing out the baby ( economic growth ) with the bathwater ( exchange rate appreciation ) . Consider China , which accounts for the largest share by far of world trade among emerging economies . Real appreciation of the renminbi is necessary for a balanced world economic recovery . But disorderly appreciation may seriously affect China's economic growth by disrupting its export industries , which would generate major adverse effects on all of East Asia . China needs a major internal restructuring from exports and investments , its two engines of growth in past decades , to personal and government consumption ( education , health , and social protection in the latter case ) . But this restructuring will tend to reduce , not increase , import demand , as exports and investment are much more import-intensive than consumption . Moreover , a sharp appreciation of the renminbi could risk domestic deflation and a financial crisis . Chinese authorities certainly seem to have that interpretation of the roots of Japan's malaise in mind as they seek to avoid rapid revaluation . The only desirable scenario , therefore , is a Chinese economy that transmits its stimulus to the rest of the world mainly through rising imports generated by rapid economic growth ( i . e . , the income effect on import demand ) , rather than by exchange-rate appreciation ( the substitution effect ) . This requires maintaining rapid growth while undertaking a major but necessarily gradual domestic restructuring , for which a smooth appreciation is much better suited . Now consider other major emerging markets . Here currency appreciation is already taking place , pushed by massive capital inflows since the second quarter of 2009 , and in some cases it can already be said to be excessive ( for example , in Brazil ) . These countries can , of course , resist upward pressure on their currencies by accumulating foreign-exchange reserves , like they did before the global financial crisis . The result is , of course , paradoxical : private funds that flow into these countries are recycled into US Treasury securities via investment of accumulated reserves . Why should emerging-market countries' central banks undertake this peculiar financial intermediation , which represents a major cost , as the yield of private funds is higher than that of reserves ? The implication here is that relying on free movement of capital to achieve exchange-rate appreciation and current-account deficits may generate a myriad of problems , including slower economic growth and the threat of asset bubbles and financial crises of their own . So , a more orderly way to induce current-account deficits without risking disruption of emerging economies' growth should be considered . One solution ( already advocated by some , including me , and adopted to some extent by a few countries ) is broader use of capital-account regulations . Surprisingly , however , this issue has been entirely absent from current global debates on financial reform . Fortunately , the IMF opened the door to discussion of this issue in a recent staff position paper . Equally important , a desirable global scenario is possibly one in which most developing countries run current-account deficits . But this requires major reforms in the global financial system to reduce the vulnerabilities that such deficits generated in the past , and that were reflected in major financial crises in the developing world . These past crises gave rise to a form of "" self-insurance "" among developing countries through reserve accumulation . This helped many of them weather the recent storm , but it also contributed to global payments imbalances . Recent IMF reforms are just a step in the direction of trying to create better financial instruments to help these countries . It is essential , in particular , to create reliable large-scale financing for developing countries during crises , through a mix of counter-cyclical issuance of SDRs and emergency financing without onerous conditions ."	0

1167	"Fashion and Identity essay "" ... Fashion is more powerful than any tyrant "" Malcolm Barnard For hundreds of years people have put some message in the type of clothing they wore . Long ago people started wanting to stand out from the "" crowd "" and be different from other people by means of changing their clothing . Some examples of these "" standing out "" became very popular and were followed by more people . This was the moment when fashion appeared . Nowadays , fashion is sometimes defined as a "" constantly changing trend , favored for frivolous rather than practical , logical , or intellectual reasons "" . Nevertheless , it is necessary to say that at the present moment fashion has a deeper influence on the life of people and possess more than just frivolous reasons for its existance . Clothing has become an integral part of self-realization of every person . It is no longer just an "" external shield "" and a frivolous attitude towards it may cause loosing a very important physical , psychological and social aspect of a person's life . The harmony attained by the combination of the inner world of a person and his "" exterior "" makes it very hard to say not even being a professional in this sphere that fashion is just about looks . Clothing is basically a covering designed to be worn on a person's body . This covering is a need , a necessity that is dictated by the norms of social conduct . This "" necessity "" brings a lot of variety into the lives of people and makes their image more complete . It is not about people serving fashion ; it is about fashion being a slave of people . Fashion and identity . The type of clothing completely depends on the person who is wearing it ; therefore it becomes a reflection of his perception of himself , which leads us to the term – personal identity . Lately a lot is being heard about personal identity and its meaning in the life of every single person on the planet . The choice of clothing and accessories ( clothing that is worn or carried , but not part of a person's main clothing ) is as important as identification through the color of hair , height , skin and gender . Clothing nowadays is a media of information about the person wearing it [ Barnard 21 ] . It is a cipher ; a code that needs a decryption in order to understand what kind of person is underneath it . The present time offers a great variety of these "" ciphers "" and therefore gives people a large number of opportunities to reveal their identity . As every cloth carries a strong message about its owner , every owner "" nests "" a certain value in it depending on his temperament , mindset or today's mood . Therefore , the clothing of a person is a mean of communication with the outside world . It is the way of telling people about the "" state "" and the "" status "" of it owner [ Barnes & Eicher 125 ] . Communication through fashion . Communication by its definition is supposed to be bilateral . So if a person carries a strong personal message to the people outside what is the response from their side ? The response is the reaction on the clothes the person it wearing . It can be acceptance or complete outcast and a misunderstanding . This especially touches extraordinarity in clothing ( a very expressive personal identity ) or an obvious lack of taste and vulgarity . Malcolm Barnard in his book "" Fashion as communication "" makes a great work by outlining cultural roles , rules , rituals , and responsibilities that are maintained and constructed by fashion [ Barnard 13,34 ] . Fashion is compared to art . It is like an architector that gives his creation any shape he desires and at the same time is the reflection of the architector 's belonging to a certain social level , a certain psychological condition and so on . One of the questions concerning the communication through fashion is whether the message possessed by fashion is the reflection of the internal or external identity . There are arguments that support each of the sides ; therefore it goes without saying that fashion is a "" polyhedral being "" that intersects numerous internal and external aspects of any personality . The message that clothing contains is basically a way of nonverbal communication with gender , ethical and power aspects . Impact on outer perception . Clothes have an immense impact on the perception of people around and on the perception of the person wearing them , too . A suit can make a person feel more confident and organized , which would eventually change even the gestures and the manner of talking of the person or for instance wearing jeans after a suit may change the conduct of a person to a very liberal and feeble one [ Hollander 58 ] . The perception of people around can be very predictable in terms of their reaction on a person wearing this or that style of clothing . Fashion is one of the most powerful means of communication , which sometimes may play a vital role in the life of a person ; it especially concerns the cases of getting a desired job . Therefore fashion may not only carry a message , it can also create a "" pseudo-message "" that is required by a situation the person finds himself in . This can be simply proved by analyzing the reaction of the people on the street on people wearing different types of clothing . The preference is always given to people dressed in "" business style "" , personifying their dignity and seriousness in everything . This is one of the primary reasons that even the smallest companies make wearing a suit one of their requirements for their employees . The customers feel more confident in such "" consultants "" . So , fashion is a very keen tool of manipulation while communicating besides its importance in social class , culture , sex and gender relations of people . Men , women and fashion . Clothing is a fundamental part in the image of a contemporary man or a woman [ Crane 47 ] . The image is constructed for various reasons and has various manifestations . Dressing has become a way to create , to reveal and to conceal information from the external observers . Fashion has always been considered to have more of a women based orientation . As soon as women realized that experimenting with their clothing might bring them the results they need they became the most interested consumers and the demand on women's production increased greatly . Women and clothing . In spite of all arguments fashion remains possessing an ambivalent entity . Women , have a great impact on the development of fashion worldwide . Of course one of the primary messages clothes carry is the social message . Women throughout the time have tried to make the clothing look more luxurious . Historically the social message has wildly transformed . It is very easily trace in Diana Crane's book "" Fashion and it social agendas "" . Nowadays clothing is not an attribute of belonging to a clan , or to a restrained social level though it still can tell a lot about the financial status of a person . A person , especially a women is always greeted according to the way is dressed up . Therefore women may cause desirable reaction by knowing the expectations of the "" opponent "" . Historically , women wore traditional dresses , which signified their cultural and social status [ Guy & Green 76 ] . As for now , traditional clothing has been completely subdued by "" fashionable clothing "" . Women clothing in the past had a lot to do with emphasizing femininity , neglecting man-like forms of dressing . Analyzing the way of dressing today it is necessary to say that "" fashionable clothing "" has made a great "" kick "" to femininity . Women become less ladylike but more aggressive and businesslike . A woman is opposed to a man ; it is no longer an "" addenda "" to a male , but a force able to contradict him and to compete with him . Women have accepted a lot of clothing styles that propagandize masculinity . Of course there still are women that are the embodiments of tenderness and femininity preserving women's sexuality but nevertheless the general tendency of feminization in today's society has done its work . Equality at work , business and politics has transformed the image of a woman greatly . Men and fashion . Throughout the history starting with the middle ages men's fashion has changed a lot . If the era of Renaissance was characterized by increased femininity in men's clothes , the end of the twentieth century became the moment of maximal revealing of masculinity for men . Nowadays , identity has brought a lot of specific changes in the perception of a contemporary man . An open manifestation of sexual orientation has brought the image of a feminine man into fashion . The adaptation of feminine tendencies into men's fashion is transparent . Men tend to choose practical clothes as casual clothing and suits as their "" working uniform "" [ Hollander 43 ] . The whole image of a man is not brusque and rough anymore . It has become more flexible and soft . The construction of a man's wardrobe starts with choosing from the variety of images offered by culture and class today . The gender boundary is gradually "" wiped "" off . Nevertheless , clothing remains the primary criterion of the evaluation of the opposite sex . While being very liberate towards the type of clothing of other men , they demonstrate especial criticism towards women's clothing . This happens due to the variety and abundance of women around . Analyzing men's fashion is like dealing with a complexity . This complexity is constantly changing and adjusting to the surrounding of tendencies . Symbolism of clothing . It is no surprise to any of the people who at least know what fashion is that the clothes that people wear are usually very symbolic . The symbolism of clothing is another part of delivering the message that a person tries to put into it . The symbolism may touch any sphere . For instance : music , sexual orientation , some kind of club and so on [ Barnard 62 ] . Originally , a symbol is a facility that is used to express feelings or belonging to some group of class often dealing with power and wealth . Every observable symbol may carry a deeper meaning than it is visually understandable . Expression of symbols through clothing is a very popular tendency nowadays . Symbolism in clothing may point to the profession the person is dedicated to , supporting the "" cipher "" theory . The perception of symbols is not the same as the perception of the whole clothing image of an individual , because people may interpret the same symbol differently and therefore the understanding of the carrier of the symbol will be completely different . For instance , a man with a tiger on this T-shit may seem aggressive to one person and a Green Peace member for another one . A bird may be a symbol of freedom and somebody can view it a symbol of light-mindedness . Every person has to be very careful with the symbol while visiting a foreign country , due to the double meaning of the symbols that may be offending to the culture the person is in . Though the goal of every symbol is to share information , nevertheless some symbols may be inappropriate . Particular articles of clothing also contain messages with give information about the person possessing them . For example a veil interpreted as mourning or an extreme aloofness . A walking stick may be necessary to the health condition but may also be a "" sign of luxury "" . Culture and fashion . As every person belongs to a definite culture and has the right to reveal it , personal identity may sometimes be replaced by cultural identity . Cultural identity is the type of identity that is related to a certain culture or a separate group . It brings people belonging to a culture definite highlighting differences with other people . Clothing in terms of culture is to reveal either the historical roots of a person or the roots the group he belongs to . The oriental-followers are easily defined from the crowd by the specific collars and style of dressing they hold on to . Demonstrating a belonging to a certain cultural community is the free right of every person like people that freely declare who they are going to vote for . Talking about culture it is possible to mention that nowadays exists "" material culture "" that dictates its own ways and code of dressing [ Crane 51 ] . The liberation of culture off the borders made the cultural fashion developments increase dramatically . The "" freedom of word "" has found a place in every single cultural attribute nowadays . Wearing a cowboy hat may not be a sign of being from Texas , but a sign of political preference . For instance it is very easy to distinguish a European from a Hindu by the style of dressing or an Indian woman from an oriental woman by the distinctive spot on the forehead of an Indian woman and a veil worn by Moslem woman . Fashion has taken the best part of the traditional costumes of every culture and sometimes this leads to propagandizing a definite cultural group . For instance , the brightest example is the increasing interest towards the Moslems and oriental culture nowadays . Fashion and identity are inseparable companions . Fashion with all its symbolism and attributes form an outstanding base for personal and cultural identification . Identity is a necessary process of a healthy personality as it is a part of self-realization of a person that is so much required for finding a place in life of every person . Fashion has become a tool for achieving harmony with the inner world and a way of revealing or concealing peculiarities . Fashion possesses a specific meaning and the more diverse is the society around us the more fashion-trend will appear and surprise us . As long as it does not hurt people around fashion symbols are acceptable , nevertheless while thinking about fashion and identity it is necessary to remember the ethical side of the issue . Fashion and identity through it still remains a twofold issue but there are a lot of positive aspects one can enjoy and share with other people ."	0
231	"Agenda The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The meeting was called to order at 10.45 a . m . Expression of thanks to the retiring President The President : As this is the first open meeting of the Security Council for the month of August , I should like to take the opportunity to pay tribute , on behalf of the Council , to His Excellency Sir Jeremy Greenstock , Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations , for his service as President of the Security Council for the month of July 2002 . I am sure I speak for all members of the Council in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Greenstock for the great diplomatic skill with which he conducted the Council's business last month . Adoption of the agenda The agenda was adopted . The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo The President : I should like to inform the Council that I have received letters from the representatives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Rwanda and South Africa , in which they request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda . In conformity with the usual practice , I propose , with the consent of the Council , to invite those representatives to participate in the discussion , without the right to vote , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure . There being no objection , it is so decided . On behalf of the Council , I extend a warm welcome to Her Excellency Ms. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma , Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa . At the invitation of the President , Ms. Dlamini Zuma ( South Africa ) took a seat at the Council table . The President : On behalf of the Council , I extend a warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Léonard She Okitundu , Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . At the invitation of the President , Mr. She Okitundu ( Democratic Republic of the Congo ) took a seat at the Council table . The President : On behalf of the Council , I also extend a warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka , Special Envoy of the President of Rwanda on the Great Lakes Region . At the invitation of the President , Mr. Mazimpaka ( Rwanda ) took a seat at the Council table . The President : The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda . The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations . I would like to extend a warm welcome to the Secretary-General , Mr. Kofi Annan , and to thank our special guests for having come so far at such short notice . They have shown great statesmanship by signing an Agreement that represents an important step towards ending a war that that has cost countless lives and produced immeasurable suffering . With the help of South African President Mbeki , the signatory heads of State have for the first time met to pledge to bring this difficult chapter in their history to a close . They should be applauded . The Agreement signed in Pretoria on 30 July provides a real opportunity for progress . Members of the Council want to understand fully the provisions of the Agreement and the intentions of the parties to ensure that all those who will play a role in making the Agreement work understand their responsibilities and obligations . Implementation will be a difficult and complicated task that will require unswerving commitment by the parties and by the international community . Having said that by way of introduction , I shall now give the floor to the Secretary-General . The Secretary-General : I shall be brief this morning . Let me say how happy I am to see the representatives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda here this morning , as well as , of course , Minister Dlamini Zuma , representing South Africa , which co-facilitated this agreement . I believe that the signing of the peace agreement between the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda in Pretoria on 30 July represents an important political milestone which could help pave the way towards a lasting resolution of one of Africa's most complex conflicts . The parties have indicated their determination to honour this agreement and to end the conflict . We , on our side , should do whatever we can to assist them in implementing the agreement . I applaud President Mbeki for his important contribution to the agreement in his capacity as Chairman of the African Union . The two presidents have committed themselves to achieving peace and , specifically , to working with each other to achieve it . That is very encouraging . We must now quickly approach the parties in a pragmatic manner and urge them to take the steps required to operationalize the agreement as soon as possible . I believe that the international community must provide all necessary support to ensure the success of this initiative . The momentum established must be maintained and built upon . I hope this meeting of the Council can contribute to that . I have instructed the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) to determine which actions it can take within its current mandate and resources to assist the parties to carry out the agreement . However , the parties need to be perfectly clear on the tasks to be performed and to provide the necessary information in order for MONUC to define its specific role . The Secretariat is also looking forward to receiving a team of experts from South Africa – in fact , I think they have arrived today – to discuss together the support that the process requires and how we move forward from here . I therefore expect to revert to the Council in due course with specific recommendations for MONUC after the Secretariat undertakes intensive consultations with the parties concerned . The presence with us today of the South African Foreign Minister , as well as of Mr. She Okitundu of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mr. Mazimpaka of Rwanda is particularly valuable because it enables you to engage directly with the Council and enables the Council to engage you on issues that are directly concerned with the implementation of the agreement . Of course , I look forward to a very serious dialogue not only here in the Council but also with the various United Nations departments . I think that reflects the value of the new partnership between the African Union and the United Nations . I am now eager to listen to the Foreign Minister of South Africa and to the representatives of the parties so that we can gain a full and detailed understanding of this important agreement and this implementation as soon as possible . The President : I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa . Ms. Dlamini Zuma ( South Africa ) : Mr. President , allow me to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of August . Let me also express our sincere gratitude for inviting us to address the Council on an important development in our continent . I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts and contribution to bring about peace and stability throughout the African continent . The recent launch of the African Union has highlighted our commitment to peace and development in Africa . We believe that the United Nations can be an important partner as we rebuild our continent , especially using the principles enshrined in the New Partnership for Africa's Development ( NEPAD ) . Last week , the Presidents of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Rwandese Republic took an important step by signing a peace agreement on the withdrawal of the Rwandan troops from the territory of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the dismantling of the former Rwandan Army ( ex-FAR ) and Interahamwe forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . This peace agreement assumes greater significance in that it comes in the wake of the tremendous progress that was made by the Congolese people in the inter-Congolese dialogue , which was held in our country earlier this year . This agreement is very important , and it is at the centre of the peace process . It therefore gives a strong signal of political will on the sides of both Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to expedite a peace process between themselves . It is very important that we all support and encourage the implementation of this agreement . We can not be seen to be less than enthusiastic about it . To understand the agreement before us , we must go back to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement of 1999 . In that agreement , there was a question on how to deal with the foreign forces that had come into the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Everyone acknowledged that the foreign troops would have to withdraw in order to allow the people of the country to decide on their future without any external interference . The problem remained of the presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo of the armed military groups such as Interahamwe and ex-FAR , which were implicated in the Rwandese genocide . In the years since the signing of the Lusaka Agreement , it has become even more clear that the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo could not be resolved until the matter of the armed groups was addressed . We are all aware that these armed groups operate freely within the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and not only continue to pose a real threat to the people of Rwanda but can destabilize the Democratic Republic of the Congo itself . We welcome the declared wish of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo not to have those armed groups utilize its territory for launching attacks against its neighbours . We also welcome the commitment of the Government of Rwanda to withdraw its forces from the Democratic Republic of the Congo as soon as those military groups cease to be a threat to the people of Rwanda . At the launch of the African Union , a crucial meeting was held when President Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda met for the first time . The meeting was held in the presence of President Mbeki and Secretary-General Kofi Annan , who was accompanied by senior leadership of United Nations Secretariat and of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) . Follow-up meetings were later held with ministers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda , together with MONUC . In this regard , we would like to pay tribute to MONUC for its role in supporting peace efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Despite its limited strength and the difficult conditions that prevail , MONUC has managed to carry out its duties . The Durban meeting laid the basis for the peace agreement . It was where both President Kagame and President Kabila asked President Mbeki and Secretary-General Annan to act jointly as a third party guaranteeing the agreement . From the outset we wish to make clear that the agreement signed between the two Governments is a reflection of their wishes and interests . Furthermore , it does not supplant the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement of 1999 and subsequent agreements but , rather , complements all of them . The need for this Agreement stems from the recognition that progress in establishing lasting peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo can not be registered without resolving the conflict between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda . There is no doubt that the developments of the last month have created a political momentum that must be seized and supported by all actors concerned , including the international community . That momentum , in turn , requires that every one of us do everything necessary to achieve the targets set out in the programme of implementation . This Agreement has given the rare gift of hope to the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to all the countries of the Great Lakes region . We can not , therefore , be seen to have contributed to the slowing down of the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Rwanda and , indeed , in the rest of the Great Lakes region . We therefore look forward to the discussions this morning as a step forward towards taking the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great Lakes region to higher levels . The President : I give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Mr. She Okitundu ( Democratic Republic of the Congo ) ( spoke in French ) : Mr. President , we wish to associate ourselves with earlier speakers in offering you our warmest congratulations and in saying how gratified our delegation is to see you presiding over the Security Council in this month of August 2002 . We believe that your intellectual skills and your diplomatic talents , together with your lengthy experience of international relations , will ensure the success of the work of the Council this month . We wish also to convey to your predecessor , Sir Jeremy Greenstock of the United Kingdom , our warm congratulations and our sincere thanks for having guided the work of the Security Council with a great deal of energy and skill last month . We also wish thank you , Sir , for having convened this important meeting of the Security Council on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which certainly once again has the merit of helping us better to evaluate the peace process that is under way and to welcome the recent and very significant advances made to put an end to the war of aggression that has been waged against my country for more than four years now . We hope also that it will help to pave the way towards lasting peace for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and for all the countries of the region . The Security Council has just heard a comprehensive statement by Ms. Nkosazana Clarice Dlamini Zuma , the Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa . The Minister has clearly and eloquently described the Peace Agreement that was concluded at Pretoria on 30 July between our Government and that of the Republic of Rwanda , as well as the programme for implementation covering the withdrawal of Rwandese troops from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the dismantling of the former Rwandan army ( ex-FAR ) and Interahamwe forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The Minister has described what is at stake in the Peace Agreement and the prospects for success . We fully share her vision , and – as our head of State , Major-General Joseph Kabila , President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , stated at the signing ceremony of the Agreement – the obligations and commitments undertaken by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo pursuant to this peace agreement will be scrupulously complied with . Here we wish to extend our very sincere thanks to President Thabo Mbeki , his Government and the people of South Africa for their determination , and I would even say their obstinacy , which took us from Sun City to Pretoria by way of Durban , to ensure that peace prevails once again in the Great Lakes region . We wish also to pay tribute to our regional organization , the African Union , which , through the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) , Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim , was the first to highlight the useless and senseless nature of this war of aggression . The efforts of the interim Chairman of its Commission , Mr. Amara Essy , has always been , and remains , decisive in the quest to restore peace and calm to our region . May I lastly thank Mr. Kofi Annan , Secretary-General of our universal Organization , for his important statement . We are very grateful to him for having lent his moral weight by endorsing the Pretoria Agreement . We wish in this connection to express our full appreciation for all of his endeavours , and especially for his commitment to tirelessly exploring all possibilities likely to bring about a successful and prompt conclusion of the peace process that began at Lusaka . In order to settle the question of the war of aggression once and for all , since last year our Government has been in direct contact with the leaders of countries whose forces are illegally occupying our country , pursuant to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , which call for the holding of such meetings in order to establish the necessary relations of trust in order to promote the cause of peace . For his part , the Secretary-General , Mr. Kofi Annan , has tirelessly committed himself to this process , particularly in terms of organizing meetings with the Rwandese party , the most recent of which , at which he was present , took place in Durban , in parallel with the OAU / African Union Summit . The Pretoria Agreement , which is basically bilateral and guaranteed by the third party , falls – as the South African Minister said just now – within the framework of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement . In this regard , the Pretoria Agreement is likely greatly to facilitate and speed up the completion of the remaining phases provided for in the timetable for the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement . The Pretoria Agreement is also in conformity with the provisions of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council calling for the orderly withdrawal of all foreign troops and in particular resolution 1341 ( 2001 ) , whereby the Council , for the first time , called for , among other things , the elaboration of a plan and a precise timetable which would lead to the finalization of the total and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops , as well as for disarmament , demobilization , reintegration and repatriation or resettlement ( DDRRR ) programmes . With respect to the DDRRR process , the Democratic Republic of the Congo undertakes strictly to comply with its obligations under this Agreement , inter alia , by pursuing the process of the demobilization and disarmament of Rwandese combatants which began at Kamina and by extending it to other areas of the country under foreign occupation as the authority of the State is established there . Moreover , we would like to express to the international community as a whole our trust in the fact that we will receive support from it in the simultaneous process of the withdrawal of troops and repatriation , reintegration and resettlement of combatants in their countries of origin , in conformity with international law . With respect to the withdrawal of foreign troops , it should be noted that the majority of the parties to the conflict had already submitted their plans to the Joint Military Commission and have commenced their withdrawal . Among the countries that came to the assistance of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in defending its national sovereignty and its territorial integrity – countries that we wish once again to thank on behalf of the Republic for the sacrifice of their sons and daughters to the noble cause of truth , justice and dignity – Namibia has totally withdrawn , and Angola and Zimbabwe have repatriated a large number of their contingents . As to the uninvited forces , withdrawal movements have been observed only on the part of Uganda and Burundi . Rwanda , for its part , has considerably increased its forces and remains the only country to be engaged in large-scale military operations on Congolese soil . There will be tremendous rejoicing when the Congolese people , the third party and the international community are officially informed , in a few hours , of the withdrawal plan for Rwandese troops from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , pursuant to the programme of implementation of the Pretoria Agreement . Another promising sign will be the beginning of the demilitarization of the city of Kisangani , pursuant to resolution 1304 ( 2000 ) . This city , as we have stated before , must no longer be the symbol of the martyrdom of a whole nation . It must , rather , become the political and physical symbol of renewal and return to dignity for the whole of the Congolese people , the emblem of the hope for a better life for present and future generations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . At the same time , all illegal activities to exploit the natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which feed the continued war of aggression , must end . Our Government , which is fully cooperating with the group of experts set up for that purpose , will ensure that this is done . The Agreement is certainly the most serious opportunity for peace since the beginning of the war of aggression on 2 August 1998 . It provides a response – which we hope is adequate – to Rwanda's security concerns , although it is the Democratic Republic of the Congo that has been experiencing total insecurity for four years . The Agreement also envisages the restoration of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which was gravely imperilled by the Rwandan presence . Finally , the Agreement embodies the ingredients for a return to normality for the countries and the peoples of the Great Lakes region . We must succeed , but we must be helped to succeed . The international community , which welcomed the Pretoria Agreement , must invest in it tangibly and unstintingly , on either the bilateral or the multilateral level , to assist the two signatory parties and the third parties in their determination to end a conflict that has caused the deaths of more than 3 million people in four years . For its part , the United Nations can help immediately , especially by formulating for its Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a new concept of operations that would effectively activate phase III of its deployment and would both support the verification mechanism and enable it to participate in the execution structure that the third party will put in place , within the framework of the Pretoria Agreement . Action is needed now . The situation – which continues to be fragile , as demonstrated by recent events in Kisangani and by the deadly skirmishes between the Rwandese Patriotic Army and Congolese combatants of Tutsi origin in the high plateaux of Kivu – may worsen . That would augur ill for the credibility of the United Nations as a whole . We must avoid that at all costs . The improvement in the prospects for peace in the Great Lakes region enables us to look with more serenity to the process of reconciliation and national concord in our country . The political agreement for consensual management of the transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , concluded at Sun City , has made possible the reunification of more than 70 per cent of the national territory . Talks are now under way , on the one hand , with the signatory parties to the Sun City agreement and , on the other , with the other armed component , its dissidents and the components of society and the unarmed opposition , in order to define the contours of an agreement that would be more consensual and inclusive . The essential here is that we must procrastinate no longer , but rather must decide to make headway on this issue . In that regard , we are convinced that the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General , Mr. Moustapha Niasse , will meet with success . Those working to advance the transition will certainly be political leaders of all stripes , but also leaders representing religious faiths , the academic world , the media , private and public enterprise and civil society . Leaders dedicated to the moral values of governance , their greatest virtues remain disinterest and love of country . As Mrs. Mary Robinson , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , noted in her report to the Council , impunity remains one of the principal causes of human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Putting an end to such impunity is a fundamental requirement for the return to a durable peace in the region . The choice of transition leaders should take that requirement into account . Such an approach is in conformity with the recommendations in the High Commissioner's report , namely , strengthening the rule of law and the administration of justice , and the creation of mechanisms whereby all those responsible for human rights violations and for war crimes must answer for their acts . The creation of a truth and reconciliation commission on the South African model could provide an element of response . We must do justice for the millions of Congolese dead , formulating concrete measures with a view to putting an end to impunity , compensating victims and preventing the resurgence of such acts . The process of restoring peace and establishing and consolidating relations of trust must continue and be strengthened by increased credibility for the United Nations and the Security Council , for there is a risk of seeing crumble the whole edifice of the partnership that the Council has patiently built with the parties bound by the Lusaka Agreement . The United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) needs to review its operations , particularly with regard to the protection of civilians under imminent threat of physical violence , as the Council reaffirmed in resolution 1417 ( 2002 ) . The Council must redefine the concept of MONUC's operations in order to enable it to properly carry out the mission conferred on it by the Pretoria Agreement . MONUC must be given the means to enable it to operate and have unhindered access to needy populations . For example , it is indispensable that the MONUC team be authorized without further delay to have access to the locality of Minembwe in the high plateaux . It is also imperative that the reopening of the river network for humanitarian assistance and commercial trade between Kinshasa and Kisangani become a reality and that the city of Kisangani be accessible once river traffic is opened to trade in the reunified zones , pursuant to the Sun City agreement . Here , I should like to pay tribute to our friends in MONUC , under the leadership of Mr. Amos Namanga Ngongi , Special Representative of the Secretary-General , for the quality of the work that they have done and for their total devotion to the cause of peace and the restoration of dignity to the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Their efforts deserve to be encouraged and supported . For their part , the States of the region must supplement their efforts . First , it is urgent that the Democratic Republic of the Congo conclude with the Governments of Uganda and Burundi agreements similar to the Pretoria Agreement . The Government of Burundi has , in a timely manner , informed us of its intention to do this . Contacts have already been made at the highest level . We must translate into concrete action the good will expressed on both sides . Then we must sit down together and discuss our region's future . The international conference for peace , stability , security and development that we earnestly wish for should lay the basis for a new order . The international conference could help the region's countries ensure the security of their States and of their populations so that no element can intervene to disrupt order and tranquillity , while at the same time conceiving , defining and fostering the creation and development of economic activities of common interest and , lastly , promoting and intensifying trade and the movement of persons and goods . A new order at the regional level presupposes a new order at the national level . Processes of democratic transition are under way in our country and in Burundi . We remain certain that they will succeed . Furthermore , we welcome the willingness expressed by the Rwandese authorities to hold elections in their country in the medium term . We ask the international community to assist that country's efforts so that it can restore internal peace and national concord . In saying that , the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo wishes to assure all its partners – in particular our brothers in neighbouring countries – f our fervent desire to live in perfect harmony with the whole world , in a spirit of tolerance , solidarity and frank cooperation . The Pretoria Agreement is the very foundation for restoring the trust that has been lost , on the basis of which we can together renew the bonds of friendship and good-neighbourliness that should govern our future relations . The Democratic Republic of the Congo will never serve as a channel to sow discord and desolation in any country , in particular our neighbours . That is a sacred principle of our diplomacy , which we have always wished to be constructive and not subversive . The Democratic Republic of the Congo looks forward to the advent of a region where peace , security , justice and prosperity prevail . The President : I now give the floor to the Special Envoy of the President of Rwanda on the Great Lakes Region . Mr. Mazimpaka ( Rwanda ) : It is my honour to congratulate you , Sir , as others who have spoken before me have done , on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of August . In addition , allow me , through you , to extend our recognition to your predecessor , the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom , for the way in which he conducted the affairs of the Council last month . We have come to the Council today , at its invitation , to present what we believe is an unprecedented step towards the resolution of the conflict that has afflicted Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo , in the main , and the Great Lakes Region as a whole , since the signing of the Lusaka Agreement for a ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , in 1999 . The Pretoria Agreement provides solutions for what up to now have been intractable problems in the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement . The problem of the forces that carried out genocide and then relocated to bases in Zaire , later the Democratic Republic of the Congo , has preoccupied the Council and the signatories for a long time , without their having found a clear solution . Throughout , the Council continued to urge Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to work together to resolve the root causes of the conflict , that is , to find how to dissuade the former Rwandan Army ( ex-FAR ) and Interahamwe forces from carrying out attacks on Rwanda from bases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Today we firmly believe that our plan , worked out with the help of the President of the Republic of South Africa and with the encouragement and support of the Secretary-General , has a chance to succeed . We appeal to the Council to do its utmost to assist us along this path . At the signing ceremony in Pretoria , South Africa , of what is now known as the Pretoria Agreement or the Peace Agreement between the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda , President Paul Kagame characterized the Agreement as very important . He said that because the Agreement addresses two core issues that underlie the conflict : first , how to resolve the problem of the ex-FAR and Interahamwe and , secondly , the withdrawal of all former forces from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . By addressing those two issues , the Agreement paves the way for peace and stability , which have eluded our respective countries for a long time . Those familiar with the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement , including the Council , know that we have been painfully aware of the poor record of our performance in the area of the disarmament , demobilization and repatriation of the armed groups . As crucial as that part of the Lusaka Agreement may be , the parties have so far failed to make any headway in effecting any meaningful disarmament and , hence , in reducing the security threat to affected countries , principally Rwanda . What the Pretoria Agreement brings to the process is a solemn commitment by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to track , assemble and disarm ex-FAR and Interahamwe , in collaboration with the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) , the Joint Military Commission ( JMC ) and the third party . Rwanda , in turn , undertook to withdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo as soon as this process gets under way and is judged to be irreversible . Let me recall here that Rwanda's commitment to the repatriation and reintegration of combatants has withstood the test of time , numbers and adverse conditions . Since 1994 , a large number of members of the former Armed Forces of Rwanda have rejoined the military service in our country or been demobilized like any members of the national forces . The militias who accompanied these forces in the wars in the Congo have also come home in large numbers and have been resettled into normal civilian life . The now-well-documented 2,000 captives of the 2001 war in the north-west of Rwanda have by now been settled , and some of them have actually formed a group to carry out sensitization work among those who are still in Congo , using the themes of national unity and reconciliation , which they have witnessed in the country . Recently , this group accompanied MONUC to Benin to help in confidence-building among the small group of combatants who had indicated that they wanted to go home . Unfortunately , for that particular operation , the heavy presence of detractors of this process made it impossible for the group to go home , although they had been waiting for two months to be repatriated . We hope that in the future such groups will not be exposed to so-called political leaders and other agents who interfere with their wish to return home . Through the work of MONUC and the JMC we are all aware , or will have an idea , about where the ex-Far and Interahamwe are operating from in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and how they are organized . Indeed , it is on that basis that assembly areas were planned . Those plans were approved by the signatories to the Lusaka Agreement . We need MONUC's assistance to make the assembly areas operational and secure . The repatriation exercise will require more resources , particularly for transport and resettlement . The Government of Rwanda will continue to do its part in ensuring that this process is successful . Rwanda is grateful for all the assistance the United Nations has provided in our trying times . We hope that the Council will see the resolution of the conflict in the region as a shared challenge . Rwanda is grateful to President Thabo Mbeki and the rest of the leadership of the Republic of South Africa for their commitment to peace in our region . Equally , we warmly welcome the commitment of President Mbeki as Chairman of the African Union ( AU ) , as well as that of the Secretaries-General of the AU and of the United Nations , to see the Agreement implemented as signed . We appeal for continued support for all the parties involved in the conflict , as this effort alone can not resolve all the outstanding problems – such as the need to work out an all-inclusive agreement and to achieve the withdrawal of all other foreign forces . On this occasion , Rwanda fully recognizes the problems caused by the presence and activities of our nationals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . That is why we salute and welcome the decision of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to negotiate this Agreement , as well as the leadership demonstrated by President Joseph Kabila in signing the Pretoria Agreement . In this spirit , we believe that all the other outstanding issues should find solutions through a sincere and pragmatic exchange among the countries of our region . Allow me to conclude my remarks by reiterating the commitment President Paul Kagame made on behalf of the people of Rwanda on the occasion of the signing of the Peace Agreement in Pretoria at the end of last month . "" Rwanda is ready to fulfil its part of the obligations as agreed in this Memorandum of Understanding . We are going to sign . We stand ready to work with you , our African brothers and sisters , and to work with the rest of the international community so as to bring about peace and security , which are very important to the people to Rwanda , the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the whole people of Africa . "" The President : There are no further speakers inscribed on my list for this portion of the meeting this morning . The Security Council will continue the consideration of this item on its agenda following the adjournment of the open meeting , whereupon we will enter into a private meeting . But before adjourning this portion of the meeting , I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his presence in having joined us this morning . The meeting rose at 11.35 a . m . This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages . The final text will be printed in the Official Records of the Security Council . Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only . They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service , room C-178 ."	1

56	"I Chapter Five The brick front was just in a line with the street , or rather the road . Behind the door hung a cloak with a small collar , a bridle , and a black leather cap , and on the floor , in a corner , were a pair of leggings , still covered with dry mud . On the right was the one apartment , that was both dining and sitting room . A canary yellow paper , relieved at the top by a garland of pale flowers , was puckered everywhere over the badly stretched canvas ; white calico curtains with a red border hung crossways at the length of the window ; and on the narrow mantelpiece a clock with a head of Hippocrates shone resplendent between two plate candlesticks under oval shades . On the other side of the passage was Charles's consulting room , a little room about six paces wide , with a table , three chairs , and an office chair . Volumes of the "" Dictionary of Medical Science , "" uncut , but the binding rather the worse for the successive sales through which they had gone , occupied almost along the six shelves of a deal bookcase . The smell of melted butter penetrated through the walls when he saw patients , just as in the kitchen one could hear the people coughing in the consulting room and recounting their histories . Then , opening on the yard , where the stable was , came a large dilapidated room with a stove , now used as a wood-house , cellar , and pantry , full of old rubbish , of empty casks , agricultural implements past service , and a mass of dusty things whose use it was impossible to guess . The garden , longer than wide , ran between two mud walls with espaliered apricots , to a hawthorn hedge that separated it from the field . In the middle was a slate sundial on a brick pedestal ; four flower beds with eglantines surrounded symmetrically the more useful kitchen garden bed . Right at the bottom , under the spruce bushes , was a cure in plaster reading his breviary . Emma went upstairs . The first room was not furnished , but in the second , which was their bedroom , was a mahogany bedstead in an alcove with red drapery . A shell box adorned the chest of drawers , and on the secretary near the window a bouquet of orange blossoms tied with white satin ribbons stood in a bottle . It was a bride's bouquet ; it was the other one's . She looked at it . Charles noticed it ; he took it and carried it up to the attic , while Emma seated in an arm-chair ( they were putting her things down around her ) thought of her bridal flowers packed up in a bandbox , and wondered , dreaming , what would be done with them if she were to die . During the first days she occupied herself in thinking about changes in the house . She took the shades off the candlesticks , had new wallpaper put up , the staircase repainted , and seats made in the garden round the sundial ; she even inquired how she could get a basin with a jet fountain and fishes . Finally her husband , knowing that she liked to drive out , picked up a second-hand dogcart , which , with new lamps and splashboard in striped leather , looked almost like a tilbury . He was happy then , and without a care in the world . A meal together , a walk in the evening on the highroad , a gesture of her hands over her hair , the sight of her straw hat hanging from the window-fastener , and many another thing in which Charles had never dreamed of pleasure , now made up the endless round of his happiness . In bed , in the morning , by her side , on the pillow , he watched the sunlight sinking into the down on her fair cheek , half hidden by the lappets of her night - cap. Seen thus closely , her eyes looked to him enlarged , especially when , on waking up , she opened and shut them rapidly many times . Black in the shade , dark blue in broad daylight , they had , as it were , depths of different colours , that , darker in the centre , grew paler towards the surface of the eye . His own eyes lost themselves in these depths ; he saw himself in miniature down to the shoulders , with his handkerchief round his head and the top of his shirt open . He rose . She came to the window to see him off , and stayed leaning on the sill between two pots of geranium , clad in her dressing gown hanging loosely about her . Charles , in the street buckled his spurs , his foot on the mounting stone , while she talked to him from above , picking with her mouth some scrap of flower or leaf that she blew out at him . Then this , eddying , floating , described semicircles in the air like a bird , and was caught before it reached the ground in the ill-groomed mane of the old white mare standing motionless at the door . Charles from horseback threw her a kiss ; she answered with a nod ; she shut the window , and he set off . And then along the highroad , spreading out its long ribbon of dust , along the deep lanes that the trees bent over as in arbours , along paths where the corn reached to the knees , with the sun on his back and the morning air in his nostrils , his heart full of the joys of the past night , his mind at rest , his flesh at ease , he went on , re-chewing his happiness , like those who after dinner taste again the truffles which they are digesting . Until now what good had he had of his life ? His time at school , when he remained shut up within the high walls , alone , in the midst of companions richer than he or cleverer at their work , who laughed at his accent , who jeered at his clothes , and whose mothers came to the school with cakes in their muffs ? Later on , when he studied medicine , and never had his purse full enough to treat some little work-girl who would have become his mistress ? Afterwards , he had lived fourteen months with the widow , whose feet in bed were cold as icicles . But now he had for life this beautiful woman whom he adored . For him the universe did not extend beyond the circumference of her petticoat , and he reproached himself with not loving her . He wanted to see her again ; he turned back quickly , ran up the stairs with a beating heart . Emma , in her room , was dressing ; he came up on tiptoe , kissed her back ; she gave a cry . He could not keep from constantly touching her comb , her ring , her fichu ; sometimes he gave her great sounding kisses with all his mouth on her cheeks , or else little kisses in a row all along her bare arm from the tip of her fingers up to her shoulder , and she put him away half-smiling , half-vexed , as you do a child who hangs about you . Before marriage she thought herself in love ; but the happiness that should have followed this love not having come , she must , she thought , have been mistaken . And Emma tried to find out what one meant exactly in life by the words felicity , passion , rapture , that had seemed to her so beautiful in books ."	6

791	Nature of problem : With the present program the derivation of the coefficients produced by the equation ( 14 ) is obtained . The first part of the proposed program consists of the calculation of the matrix elements which form the coefficients of the system of equations . The second part of the proposed program , as this has been explained in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] , consists of the iterative application of the L ' Hospital's rule ( to avoid coefficients of the form 0 / 0 ) for the computation of the solution of these equations that make up the coefficients of the method ( 14 ) . We note that the system of equations produced by the equation ( 14 ) is solved by an application of Cramer's rule . The above procedure is repeated for the calculation of the coefficients of the methods ( 24 ) - ( 25 ) and for the methods ( 28 ) - ( 29 ) . Solution method : Symbolic computation using Maple .

265	An Epsom mum has recently set up her own party planning company to help make children's birthday dreams come true . Marina Chalke , decided to start her business - called Littlepartyplanner - after the birth of her youngest son last year . ' Having organised my older children's parties in the past , I understood the importance of getting it just right for them ' explains Marina . ' I always wanted something special , but juggling work , a busy mum schedule and organising a party often meant I had bitten off more than I could chew ' . ' There is always so much to organise - did I go for a disco , an entertainer or bouncy castle ? What about the cake ? What about invites ? And where was I going to hold it ? Home was n ' t always a good option ! ' ' What I needed back then was an expert , who could offer advice on organising a successful party and deciding what kind of theme it should take , but there never seemed to be anyone in my local area to help with the intricate details ' . After having her little boy , Luca , in 2005 she wanted to help other busy mums so that they did not go through the same pressure . So she decided to become the expert herself . Under the guidance of national franchise company Mums in Control , she set about creating a business that meant she could work from home . ' Little Party Planners offers other busy parents the chance to hand over all the hard work that goes into organising a party for the kids , ' says Marina . ' I have a huge list of contacts in the local area , from musicians and venues to cake decorators and bouncy castles , this means the planning can be left to me . ' Parents let me have an idea of what they want and leave it to myself to organise . They just have to turn up with their children and their friends and know everything will be sorted for them . It takes so much pressure out of something that can cause so much anxiety . ' Unfortunately after all her initial hard work starting up her new venture , she stumbled across an obstacle . ' I wanted to approach mums after school , at the school gate where I could speak to them and hand out my leaflet ' she explains ' but as soon as I stepped out of my front door I could n ' t do it , my confidence had gone and I just did n't know how to conquer this fear ' . This is when the BBC came into play . They were putting together four , 6 minute programmes on going back to work after having a baby and were interested in talking to Marina . ' I was desperate to sort this glitch in my new business venture . I did n't know what had happened to me and needed guidance on how to get my confidence back ' . So with the help of TV Presenter Melinda Messenger and Careers Coach , John Lees she went ahead with the filming to help her readdress her confidence issues . ' John offered me some really good advice ' she says ' In my previous job roles I have been used to endorsing a product , this time the product was me and I was using the wrong approach ' . This realisation has helped Marina to get over the first hurdle of speaking to groups of mums and dads that she did n't know . ' I have since used Johns approach and everything is falling into place . ' Marina could n ' t be happier about how things are turning out . Being able to work from home has meant that she has been able to spend valuable time with her children . ' It 's the ideal business for anyone , like me , who wants to work but also wants to spend precious time with their children . I am able to fit in much of my planning around them , so I do n't feel I miss out on the important things , ' Marina adds . · For more details on Little Party Planners contact Marina Chalke on 0208 394 0702 or email : marinachalke @ littlepartyplanner . c o . u k .

909	"Hark , he 's singing ! Its his favorite amusement . "" And once more those shrill discordant tones rang out : -- "" He thought he saw a Banker's Clerk Descending from the bus : He looked again , and found it was A Hippopotamus : ' If this should stay to dine , ' he said , ' There wo n't be mutch for us ! ' "" Throwing away the spade , he broke into a frantic jig , snapping his fingers , and repeating , again and again , "" There wo n't be much for us ! There wo n't be much for us ! "" [ Image ... It was a hippoptamus ] Once more the Baron looked slightly offended , but the Vice-Warden hastily explained that the song had no allusion to him , and in fact had no meaning at all . "" You did n't mean anything by it , now did you ? "" He appealed to the Gardener , who had finished his song , and stood , balancing himself on one leg , and looking at them , with his mouth open . "" I never means nothing , "" said the Gardener : and Uggug luckily came up at the moment , and gave the conversation a new turn . "" Allow me to present my son , "" said the Vice-warden ; adding , in a whisper , "" one of the best and cleverest boys that ever lived ! I 'll contrive for you to see some of his cleverness . He knows everything that other boys do n't know ; and in archery , in fishing , in painting , and in music , his skill is--but you shall judge for yourself . You see that target over there ? He shall shoot an arrow at it . Dear boy , "" he went on aloud , "" his Adiposity would like to see you shoot . Bring his Highness' bow and arrows ! "" Uggug looked very sulky as he received the bow and arrow , and prepared to shoot . Just as the arrow left the bow , the Vice-Warden trod heavily on the toe of the Baron , who yelled with the pain . "" Ten thousand pardons ! "" he exclaimed . "" I stepped back in my excitement . See ! It is a bull's - eye ! "" The Baron gazed in astonishment . "" He held the bow so awkwardly , it seemed impossible ! "" he muttered . But there was no room for doubt : there was the arrow , right in the centre of the bull's - eye ! "" The lake is close by , "" continued the Vice-warden . "" Bring his Highness' fishing-rod ! "" And Uggug most unwillingly held the rod , and dangled the fly over the water . "" A beetle on your arm ! "" cried my Lady , pinching the poor Baron's arm worse than if ten lobsters had seized it at once . "" That kind is poisonous , "" she explained . "" But what a pity ! You missed seeing the fish pulled out ! "" An enormous dead cod-fish was lying on the bank , with the hook in its mouth . "" I had always fancied , "" the Baron faltered , "" that cod were salt-water fish ? "" "" Not in this country , "" said the Vice-Warden . "" Shall we go in ? Ask my son some question on the way any subject you like ! "" And the sulky boy was violently shoved forwards , to walk at the Baron's side . "" Could your Highness tell me , "" the Baron cautiously began , "" how much seven times nine would come to ? "" "" Turn to the left ! "" cried the Vice-Warden , hastily stepping forwards to show the way---so hastily , that he ran against his unfortunate guest , who fell heavily on his face . "" So sorry ! "" my Lady exclaimed , as she and her husband helped him to his feet again . "" My son was in the act of saying ' sixty-three ' as you fell ! "" The Baron said nothing : he was covered with dust , and seemed much hurt , both in body and mind . However , when they had got him into the house , and given him a good brushing , matters looked a little better . Dinner was served in due course , and every fresh dish seemed to increase the good-humour of the Baron : but all efforts , to get him to express his opinion as to Uggug's cleverness , were in vain , until that interesting youth had left the room , and was seen from the open window , prowling about the lawn with a little basket , which he was filling with frogs . "" So fond of Natural History as he is , dear boy ! "" said the doting mother . "" Now do tell us , Baron , what you think of him ! "" "" To be perfectly candid , said the cautious Baron , "" I would like a little more evidence . I think you mentioned his skill in -- "" "" Music ? "" said the Vice-Warden ."	6

142	"The first half of the twentieth century was an absolute disaster in human affairs , a cataclysm . We had the First World War , the Great Depression , the Second World War , and the rise of the communist nations . And each one of these forces split the world , tore the world apart , divided the world . And they threw up walls , political walls , trade walls , transportation walls , communication walls , iron curtains , which divided peoples and nations . It was only in the second half of the twentieth century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss . Trade walls began to come tumbling down . Here are some data on tariffs : starting at 40 percent , coming down to less than 5 percent . We globalized the world . And what does that mean ? It means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries . We made the world more cooperative . Transportation walls came tumbling down . You know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods . Today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons . It can be manned with a smaller crew , and unloaded faster than ever before . Communication walls , I do n't have to tell you , the internet , have come tumbling down . And of course the iron curtains , political walls have come tumbling down . Now all of this has been tremendous for the world . Trade has increased . Here is just a little bit of data . In 1990 exports from China to the United States -- 15 billion dollars . By 2007 , over 300 billion dollars . And perhaps most remarkably , at the beginning of the twenty-first century , really for the first time in modern history , growth extended to almost all parts of the world . So China , I 've already mentioned , beginning in 1978 , around the time of the death of Mao , growth -- ten percent a year . Year after year after year , absolutely incredible . Never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty , as happened in China . China is the world's greatest anti-poverty program over the last three decades . India , starting a little bit later , but in 1990 , begetting tremendous growth . Incomes at that time less than 1,000 dollars per year . And over the next 18 years have almost tripled . Growth of six percent a year . Absolutely incredible . Now Africa , Sub-Saharan Africa , Sub-Saharan Africa has been the area of the world most resistant to growth . And we can see the tragedy of Africa in the first few bars here . Growth was negative . People were actually getting poorer than their parents . And sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been . But at the end of the twentieth century , the beginning of the twenty-first century , we saw growth in Africa . And I think , as you 'll see , there 's reasons for optimism . Because I believe that the best is yet to come . Now why . On the cutting edge today it 's new ideas which are driving growth . And by that I mean it 's products for which the research and development costs are really high , and the manufacturing costs are low . More than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge . Now ideas have this amazing property . Thomas Jefferson , I think , really expressed this quite well . He said , "" He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself , without lessening mine . As he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me . Or to put it slightly differently , one apple feeds one man , but an idea can feed the world . Now this is not new . This is practically not new to TEDsters . This is practically the model of TED . What is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before . This provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important , more powerful than ever before , and are going to increase growth more than ever before . And to explain why this is so , I have a question . Suppose that there are two diseases . One of them is rare , the other one is common . But if they are not treated they are equally severe . If you had to choose , which would you rather have ? The common disease or the rare disease ? Common . The common . I think that 's absolutely right . Why ? Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases . The reason for this is incentives . It costs about the same to produce a new drug , whether that drug treats 1,000 people , 100,000 people , or a million people . But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people . So the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people . To put this differently , larger markets save lives . In this case misery truly does love company . Now think about the following : if China and India were as rich as the United States is today , the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now . Now we are not there yet , but it is happening . As other countries become richer the demand for these pharmaceuticals is going to increase tremendously . And that means an increase incentive to do research and development , which benefits everyone in the world . Larger markets increase the incentive to produce all kinds of ideas . Whether it 's software , whether it 's a computer chip , whether it 's a new design . For the Hollywood people in the audience , it even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies . It 's because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures . So the market for those movies is larger . People are willing to invest more , and the budgets are larger . Alright . Well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas , how do we maximize that incentive ? It 's by having one world market , by globalizing the world . The way I like to put this is , one idea , ideas are meant to be shared , so one idea can serve one world , one market . One idea , one world , one market . Well how else can we create new ideas ? That 's one reason . Globalize , trade . How else can we create new ideas ? Well , more idea creators . Now idea creators , they come from all walks of life . Artists and innovators , many of the people you 've seen on this stage . I 'm going to focus on scientists and engineers because I have some data on that , and I 'm a data person . Now , today , less than 1 / 10th of one percent of the world's population are scientists and engineers . ( Laughter ) The United States has been an idea leader . A large fraction of those people are in the United States . But the U. S. is losing its idea leadership . And for that I am very grateful . That is a good thing . It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the United States , and a handful of other developed countries , have shouldered the entire burden of research and development . But consider the following : if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing to ideas which benefit everyone , which are shared by everyone . I think of the great Indian mathematician , Ramanujan . How many Ramanujans are there in India today toiling in the fields , barely able to feed themselves , when they could be feeding the world ? Now we 're not there yet . But it is going to happen in this century . The real tragedy of the last century is this : if you think about the world's population as a giant computer , a massively parallel processor , then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been off line . But in this century China is coming on line . India is coming on line . Africa is coming on line . We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century . Here is just some data . This is China . 1996 , less than one million new university students in China , per year . 2006 , over five million . Now think what this means . This means we all benefit when another country gets rich . We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy . That is something that we should embrace -- a wealthy China , a wealthy India , a wealthy Africa . We need a greater demand for ideas , those larger markets I was talking about earlier , and a greater supply of ideas for the world . Now you can see some of the reasons why I 'm optimistic . Globalization is increasing the demand for ideas , the incentive to create new ideas . Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas . In fact if you look at world history you can see some reasons for optimism . From about the beginnings of humanity to 1500 , zero economic growth , nothing . 1500 to 1800 , maybe a little bit of economic growth . But less in a century than you expect to see in a year today . 1900s maybe one percent . Twentieth century a little bit over two percent . Twenty-first century could easily be 3.3 even higher percent . Even at that rate by 2100 , average GDP per capita in the world will be 200,000 dollars . That 's not U. S. GDP per capita , which will be over a million . But world GDP per capita , 200,000 dollars . That 's not that far . We wo n ' t make it . But some of our grandchildren probably will . And I should say I think this is a rather modest prediction . In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy . In Kurzweilian terms I 'm like the Eeyore of economic growth . ( Laughter ) Alright what about problems ? What about a great depression ? Well let 's take a look . Let 's take a look at the Great Depression . Here is GDP per capita from 1900 to 1929 . Now let 's imagine that you were an economist in 1929 , trying to forecast future growth for the United States , not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff . Not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the twentieth century . What would you have predicted not knowing this ? If you had based your prediction , your forecast on 1900 to 1929 you 'd have predicted something like this . If you 'd been a little more optimistic , say based upon the roaring 20s , you 'd have said this . So what actually happened ? We went off a cliff but we recovered . In fact in the second half of the twentieth century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted based upon the first half of the twentieth century . So growth can wash away even what appears to be a great depression . Alright . What else ? Oil . Oil . This was a big topic . When I was writing up my notes oil was 140 dollars per barrel . So people were asking a question . The were saying , "" Is China drinking our milkshake ? "" ( Laughter ) And there is some truth to this in the sense that we have something of a finite resource . And increased growth is going to push up demand for that . But I think I do n't have to tell this audience that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing . Moreover , as everyone knows , look it 's energy , not oil , which counts . And higher oil prices mean a greater incentive to invest in energy R & D. You can see this in the data . As oil prices go up , energy patents go up . The world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today , than ever in the past , because of what I 'm talking about . One idea , one world , one market . So I 'm optimistic so long as we hew to these two ideas : to keep globalizing world markets , keep extending cooperation across national boundaries , and keep investing in education . Now the United States has a particularly important role to play in this -- to keep our education system globalized , to keep our education system open to students from all over the world -- because our education system is the candle that other students come to to light their own candles . Now remember here what Jefferson said . Jefferson said , "" When they come and light their candles at ours , that they gain light , and we are not darkened . "" But Jefferson was n ' t quite right , was he ? Because the truth is , when they light their candles at ours , there is twice as much light available for everyone . So my view is be optimistic . Spread the ideas . Spread the light . Thank you . ( Applause ) </content"	0
299	Looking back at your childhood what are the earliest memories of how the washing was done ? With a scrubbing board in a tin tub , and a dolly peg in a tub , boiling in the cellar with a fire underneath the water container . Also there were conveniences for the general public at that time . The city were I lived had a lot of baths and wash houses . They were combined with the public swimming baths and they gave the service of letting people go along to use their machines , which were huge . And you could often see people with prams pushing them down the streets with ... In those days potatoes used to come in big wicker baskets , and they 'd have a wicker basket in this pram and all the family washing . As much as they could possibly get in that wicker basket was put in there , and they wheeled it to the nearest public wash house and baths , and when it came back it was dry-ish , rather than having wet washing hanging around the house , as it would have been if it had been done in the house . You mentioned a dolly peg , what was that ? Yes , a dolly peg it was a little bit ... It was , I suppose , about 4 foot high , a little bit like a milking stool at the bottom , with a long pole in the centre , two handles at the top and you agitated it : a manual agitator . And for the very dirty bits on the working shirts , or whatever there was , you 'd have a scrubbing board . And that would stand in the water and you would put the dirty part , like the collar or the cuffs , and you would rub the soap over it and get a scrubbing brush and scrub it like that . And you knew when it was wash day because you walked in and you could smell the boiling washing , the washing that had been boiled up , even if it was in the cellar ... steam everywhere . Wet clothes hanging around forever , no dryers unless of course , you know , it was a fine day . If it was a fine day they would all get pegged out on the line . Did you used to have a mangle ? Oh yes . Now you needed strong arms for that because they were ... the big mangles were very , very heavy . Cast iron and great big thick wooden rollers . Instead of soap powders , you did n't use the soap powders we have today , so what sort of things did you use ? Well , it was carbolic soap ... Right ... or green soap sometimes . I can remember Fairy , green soap coming in . Before that it was just carbolic soap . Or those who could afford it had , I think , soap flakes perhaps : soap that had been specially flaked . But it just depended on what your income was , as to what you could afford . And then of course , a little bit later on there came the Rinso . You 've heard of Rinso have n ' t you ? It was the forerunner of all the powders . Oh , right ... Rinso ... Can you remember how any of these smelt , did they have a distinct smell or ... ? Yes , which is indescribable unless you 've smelt it yourself ! I suppose the nearest thing would be to a steamy bath . So it did n't smell nice , did n't make the clothes smell nice , it was just to clean them basically ? What was to clean them ? The soap it ... they did n't smell nice ... it was just ... Oh yes , it was a good clean smell , Yes it was good clean smell . OK . When washing machines were first invented , how long did it take for you to have one in your family , and how did this changed things ? My parents never had one , never had one . And I did n't get a washing machine until the mid fifties . How did that change ? Oh , it made a big difference , but it was n ' t an automatic . Well , what did it look like , and what did you have to ... how did it work ? Well , they worked on the same principle as they work now , with electricity . But my first one was only so big , very tiny , and it had a rubber mangle on the top ; and that was made by Hoover . And how did they differ from the ones they have today ? Oh well , the ones you have today ... there 's just no work . You just throw them in , p ress a button when you 've set the ... whatever you want , and walk away . It 's taken off your hands . In comparison , it used to take a day to do the family wash . Now you can do the equivalent in a couple of hours , all washed and ironed and dry , all out of the way . It saves hours of work . Before you had Hoovers what would you use to clean the floors ? I wondered if you 'd thought of that one . Brushes : You would sweep them with stiff brushes . And if they were very dusty , they used to have a trick of having damp tea leaves , and you 'd strew them on the carpet , all over , and that would kill the dust as you brushed . Oh right - I never knew that ! Or if the carpet ... and you remember in those days not many people - well very few - had fitted carpets . In fact I ca n ' t remember ... I ca n ' t think of anyone . They were usually big carpets or rugs . If they were small rugs they would go out over the line and you 'd beat them with a beater . Did you ever have , did you get , a Hoover eventually when they came out ? Oh yes . That obviously made things easier , but what did they look like ? Well , the first Hoovers I remember were very , very heavy in weight for me , and not unlike the traditional shape they still are , except they were made in stainless steel , I suppose , but they ... of course , by that time a lot of people had carpets all over the house , and it did make a difference . When was that roughly ? Roughly towards the end of the thirties . Right , OK , what were your earliest memories of television ? My earliest memories , Oh gosh ! I suppose the first time I ever watched television was at the year of the Coronation . Like most people , unless you were very , very wealthy , you could n ' t afford a television and the only ... The first time I watched television was on a friend's television , where we were invited to go and watch the coronation . And it was a very tiny little screen perhaps from there to there . [ Gestures a few centimetres . ] And it was , I think , in a very long , tall cabinet ... Of course , in those days your eyesight quite a lot better than it is after so many years . And it was all right and because it was new and we 'd nothing to compare it to , except the cinema , which , of course , every one was used to . You were aware that it was only tiny , but because it was contained within a room it was acceptable . Now-a-days they 're used for recreational use , you just switch on and watch it ; but how does that differ from what you used to do ? I mean , you said you were invited round , so you obviously did n't get a choice of what you watched ? Oh , very limited . In fact , I do n't think they broadcast for quite a lot of the day . You see , not owning one for a long , long time , I was n ' t aware of what programs there were ; but I have a feeling that they were very , very short hours ... mostly towards the evening time , nothing in the day particularly the mornings . But I suppose they had coverage at some stages for big events , but I really could n ' t answer that one . So , when was the first time you got a television in the family ? Once again I would say the middle fifties , and that would be ... ( How many years after they sort of came out ? ) 18 nearly 20 years after they first . You see , they only broadcast , did n't they , in the London area to begin with before the war ? Well , I was living up North , and I do n't think we had the television set up in that part of the world until after the war . I 'm not sure about that though . Before television , what technology was there to entertain you and your family ? Oh the radio , technology . I would say , all I can think of is the radio . It all depended in those days on what level of society you were . Some people had cars , they could go out riding . But if you could n ' t afford a car , well you could n ' t afford a car , and that was it . In the home the radio certainly had got more or less established in everyone's home . What did they look like , and how did they work ? Well , like anything else it started off , I suppose , with dials and headphones . They had a box and they had headphones and they had dials to bring it in and get the wave band . Those were the very ... That was my memory of the very earliest radio that I can remember ; with sitting watching my father twist the dials . And then , of course , we got ... As it improved , then you could just switch on and you even got places on the dial saying ... It would pick up places from Europe which was fantastic , you know . Was n ' t just within the country . But I am sure you will be able to get a lot of information from radio buffs who 'll be able to give you all the details , but those are my earliest memories . There was one other thing , the gramophone : and the earliest one I remember was one of those where you turn the handle and had a great big horn . With His Master's Voice ... and they were portable . This was portable , and you had , I suppose you had , a few selected records and played them constantly . In fact we used to take ours into the air raid shelter , when we had to sit in the air raid shelter at night ... It was a communal one . And the gramophone used to be taken in religiously , and it would play the records and people would ... everyone was smoking their heads off : the place was like a tap room . And suddenly , when you heard the aircraft coming , the first thing we 'd do was take the record off and sit and listen . Listen to the planes ... Listen to the planes ... and wait for the bombs to go over ... hear the swish of the bombs . But yes gramophones was another one , if you were lucky enough . OK . How old were you when you first got a telephone In your family ? Well , I suppose mid fifties , in the last century , in the mid fifties again ... when we first got our ... yes early fifties . But it was n ' t ... you did have access to phones ... Quite a number of people had them already in their houses , so I was not like some people who had never had access to using a phone . Some people were afraid of using phones because they 'd never been used to using them . How did they differ from the ones today , the touch ones ? Oh , I think the dialling , of course , was the main thing ; and obviously you had you had several different kinds . There was the hand held one and you also had the one that had it hooked on to the side , where you lifted the earpiece and spoke into the speaker . But you 've seen them all on films . You 've got record of them in old films , you know . If you keep your eyes open , you 'll see all varieties of them . But there was no touch telephones ; no , nothing like that . Was it expensive to use the telephone ? I would say for the time , very little difference , very little . And did it bring the family closer together ? I mean , you could communicate easier ? That was good , because even if both ... all members of the family did n't have a phone , it did mean that there would be a point at which they could all come together . It meant that communication was n ' t as difficult . Yes . With cooking appliances changing over the years , first you had the Aga , then the cooker and then the microwave , how did the introduction of microwaves effect your family ? It did n't , because they never had one ! It 's affected mine fantastically , wonderful . I think one of the best inventions out , but what came before the Aga ? Have n ' t got a clue , I do n't know , have n ' t got a clue . What came before the Aga ? Not everyone had an Aga . Was it called a range ? A fire range . If you were lucky enough , some houses had fireplaces where they had an oven beside it , where they cooked . Some people did n't even have that , and they had little hobs on the grates , on the fire , and they turned the hob over the fire and cooked on the fire . Did n't have a cooker , kettles too always used to sit beside the fire or hang over the fire on a hook . When you first got a microwave , how did you feel about them ? There are stories that some people were scared of them because of the waves they let out . Did it bother you ? It did n't bother me because I reasoned that it would n ' t be allowed to be sold unless it had been fully tested ; and if you 're sensible and careful . But of course , remember , it had been invented and had been used in America many years before became popular in England . So we did have that knowledge , before it was more or less introduced on a big scale in this country . Very few places actually sold microwaves for quite a while , but they were used a lot more in America for years before that . OK , central heating . Can you remember when it first came out and how did you heat the house before ? Before central heating : fires hot water bottles , loads of clothes , closed windows . And did you have an open fire in every room , or just one that heated the whole house ? Unless you were poorly , then you had one in your bedroom . Did you ever work in an office or anything like that ? Yes . And how did technology change , I mean typewriters and things like that , how has that change ? Well , I was n ' t in that kind of a situation and it was n ' t for a long , long period so I could n ' t answer that one . OK , computers : what do you think of them do you have one ? I have n ' t got one , but I am like people who were first introduced to the unknown : probably have n ' t bothered because I am just a little bit afraid that I will make a fool of myself , and that 's really the top and bottom of it . Those who have confidence in new things just go all out ; and it depends too on your need . Well I 've not needed a computer since they sort of , you know , have just become so popular . But I 'd certainly like to have a go now . Now that I 've got time and it does n ' t matter , there 's no pressure . OK . Before electricity , how would you light the house and what happened when lighting was introduced ? Well before electricity , which was wonderful , there were several stages of lighting . Candles I can recall using as a child to light my way to bed , on a candlestick . Oil lamps , which had to be trimmed and cleaned and paraffin bought for them ; and kept in absolute pristine condition because the fumes from the paraffin lights could have been dangerous . So those were the first two forms of lighting that I recall . Then town gas came in ; and if you were lucky enough you you had a house with gas supplied . Usually there was a centre light , almost like an electric light positioning and this , of course , was in the main room ; perhaps not every room , but once the gas was in the house I think most rooms did have it on little side brackets in certain rooms , but the main rooms had a middle , centre light . And you used to have ... you used to have to buy what they called mantles ; and they were terribly delicate . They were small shaped , rounded with almost , I suppose , a clay type top . And you had to put them on to the ... where the gas came out , and carefully put them round to make them hold , almost like a bulb ... and if you were n ' t careful even blowing on them sometimes would break them . So they were very delicate . And then you 'd turn the gas on . It could have been a tap that screwed in , it could have been a lever where you had like a swing , a see-saw , where you pulled it down one side and it would bring the gas out and you turned / pulled it the other and that would turn the gas off . You would then light it with either a taper or with a match , and then it would give the light . I think that went on for quite a while . Now you see , the gas obviously was introduced in some houses in the 1800's , but some houses did n't even have gas until 20's . A lot of people lived in houses that did n't even have town gas , but that was n ' t the general rule ; most people by that time had . So then , of course , you could ... you could then get electricity put in once the mains had been put in . And how they did that by taking the gas out and replacing it with electricity I do not know . But they did do that , they converted gas lit houses into electrically lit houses .	1
1101	Mediolanum ( Whitchurch ) This is the British Mediolanum of the Antonine Itinerary . Ptolemy places a separate Mediolanum , sometimes identified with Meifod , in central Wales . The town was located on a major Roman routeway between Deva Victrix ( Chester ) and Viroconium Cornoviorum ( Wroxeter ) . The Romans first built a fort which has been tentatively suggested as forming part of the border defences established by Ostorius Scapula around AD 52 . By about AD 100 , however , the army had probably moved on and the surrounding civilian ' vicus ' would have taken over the site . In the mid-2nd century , the area was at least partly covered by timber-framed industrial buildings . The town reached the height of its prosperity by the early 3rd century and there was much rebuilding in stone . This continued for the next hundred years . Masonry houses with associated wooden outhouses were most common during this period . [ 1 ] Roman artefacts from the site are on display in the Whitchurch Heritage Centre . [ 2 ]	4
612	"This is the first time I have ever shared this with another human being , so it is not easy for me . I keep thinking , I am different . I am not like the others ... although perhaps I am , except I pull my hair from my head and not my eyebrows or eyelashes . Oh , this is so hard but good to have someone I hope will not think I am silly or I am going mad !!! I can remember the day I started , vividly , why I do n't know , maybe some sort of turning point in my life at the age of ten . During my teenage years while going to high school it got to the point of having bald patches behind my ears . I got my hair cut to hide it , as we always had to have out hair up and you could see the bald spots clearly . I do n't remember my parents or anybody else saying anything to me about this , they were always too busy and did n't understand . I am now 48 , never got on with my parents and ran away from home when I was 14 , never went back till I was over 21 . I have never lived at home and can only stand a day there . I find it comes and goes , depending what happens in my life . I believe stress is a big factor . When I gave up smoking several years ago I had nothing to do with my hands so I took up hair pulling again , biting my nails and the skin around them . It 's worse when I am watching TV or not busy with my hands and when I have time to sit and do nothing , boredom . I usually head for the fridge or pull my hair out . Something - I am not sure what , must be happening in my life as in the last few years my weight has ballooned and my hair pulling has been bad in the last few months . I have been dieting and have now lost a lot but have been very very unhappy for a long time . I was never sexually abused by my parents , emotionally I would say , yes . When my parents spoke of their life as children I can now understand why they were like the way there were , always aloof and just out of reach . I always thought I was strange and I did something really weird , I had no idea there was a name for it until one night they featured one brave lady on a current affairs program about pulling her hair out , then I knew . Once , while I was at the doctors with my children I asked him about trichtillomania because I had heard people who have it do the same as I did , he told me not to be so silly , how could I have ADD and did I really think at my age I had it and did I want to start on all these drugs , with no cure . Obviously , that really put me off , I felt like a real idiot . That was years ago , my children are grown up now . THEN , last night because my hair pulling has been so bad in the last month I and I was at my witts end what to do , I do n't know why but I decided to type in ' pulling your hair out and eating it "" on my computer and bingo ! I could n't believe my eyes when all this info came up on your website and I could see with my own eyes that I am not alone after all these years ! I can stop it when I really try . I tell my hands not to do it and try not to think about it and it is very hard but the urge goes away in the end . Sometimes I can be pull free for months at a time then I think ' oh I have n't done that for ages and bang away it goes again ' that 's the way I describe it anyway . It is not an easy thing to accept there is something wrong with you . I have been through all the phyciatrists when I was younger , as I can not relate emotionally to my parents or children . When my Dad died last year I could not shed a tear and still can not . My Mum can not still tell me she loves me , even though I say it to spite her . Since I have grown older I have eventually been able to come to terms with the way I am and now have my ways to get around things . I am a very happy , strong , bubbly , outgoing , person on the outside but a very miserable person on the inside , with all these problems I hide very well . THANK YOU , THANK YOU !!"	1

The freedom to run the program means the freedom for any kind of person or organization to use it on any kind of computer system , for any kind of overall job and purpose , without being required to communicate about it with the developer or any other specific entity . In this freedom , it is the user's purpose that matters , not the developer's purpose ; you as a user are free to run the program for your purposes , and if you distribute it to someone else , she is then free to run it for her purposes , but you are not entitled to impose your purposes on her . The freedom to redistribute copies must include binary or executable forms of the program , as well as source code , for both modified and unmodified versions . ( Distributing programs in runnable form is necessary for conveniently installable free operating systems . ) It is OK if there is no way to produce a binary or executable form for a certain program ( since some languages do n't support that feature ) , but you must have the freedom to redistribute such forms should you find or develop a way to make them . In order for freedoms 1 and 3 ( the freedom to make changes and the freedom to publish improved versions ) to be meaningful , you must have access to the source code of the program . Therefore , accessibility of source code is a necessary condition for free software . Obfuscated "" source code "" is not real source code and does not count as source code . Freedom 1 includes the freedom to use your changed version in place of the original . If the program is delivered in a product designed to run someone else 's modified versions but refuse to run yours – a practice known as "" tivoization "" or "" lockdown "" , or ( in its practitioners' perverse terminology ) as "" secure boot "" – freedom 1 becomes a theoretical fiction rather than a practical freedom . This is not sufficient . In other words , these binaries are not free software even if the source code they are compiled from is free . One important way to modify a program is by merging in available free subroutines and modules . If the program's license says that you can not merge in a suitably licensed existing module – for instance , if it requires you to be the copyright holder of any code you add – then the license is too restrictive to qualify as free . Freedom 3 includes the freedom to release your modified versions as free software . A free license may also permit other ways of releasing them ; in other words , it does not have to be a copyleft license . However , a license that requires modified versions to be nonfree does not qualify as a free license . In order for these freedoms to be real , they must be permanent and irrevocable as long as you do nothing wrong ; if the developer of the software has the power to revoke the license , or retroactively change its terms , without your doing anything wrong to give cause , the software is not free . However , certain kinds of rules about the manner of distributing free software are acceptable , when they do n't conflict with the central freedoms . For example , copyleft ( very simply stated ) is the rule that when redistributing the program , you can not add restrictions to deny other people the central freedoms . This rule does not conflict with the central freedoms ; rather it protects them . "" Free software "" does not mean "" noncommercial . "" A free program must be available for commercial use , commercial development , and commercial distribution . Commercial development of free software is no longer unusual ; such free commercial software is very important . You may have paid money to get copies of free software , or you may have obtained copies at no charge . But regardless of how you got your copies , you always have the freedom to copy and change the software , even to sell copies . Whether a change constitutes an improvement is a subjective matter . If your modifications are limited , in substance , to changes that someone else considers an improvement , that is not freedom . However , rules about how to package a modified version are acceptable , if they do n't substantively limit your freedom to release modified versions , or your freedom to make and use modified versions privately . Thus , it is acceptable for the license to require that you change the name of the modified version , remove a logo , or identify your modifications as yours . As long as these requirements are not so burdensome that they effectively hamper you from releasing your changes , they are acceptable ; you 're already making other changes to the program , so you wo n ' t have trouble making a few more . Rules that "" if you make your version available in this way , you must make it available in that way also "" can be acceptable too , on the same condition . An example of such an acceptable rule is one saying that if you have distributed a modified version and a previous developer asks for a copy of it , you must send one . ( Note that such a rule still leaves you the choice of whether to distribute your version at all . ) Rules that require release of source code to the users for versions that you put into public use are also acceptable . In the GNU project , we use copyleft to protect these freedoms legally for everyone . But noncopylefted free software also exists . We believe there are important reasons why it is better to use copyleft , but if your program is noncopylefted free software , it is still basically ethical . ( See Categories of Free Software for a description of how "" free software , "" "" copylefted software "" and other categories of software relate to each other . ) Sometimes government export control regulations and trade sanctions can constrain your freedom to distribute copies of programs internationally . Software developers do not have the power to eliminate or override these restrictions , but what they can and must do is refuse to impose them as conditions of use of the program . In this way , the restrictions will not affect activities and people outside the jurisdictions of these governments . Thus , free software licenses must not require obedience to any export regulations as a condition of any of the essential freedoms . Most free software licenses are based on copyright , and there are limits on what kinds of requirements can be imposed through copyright . If a copyright-based license respects freedom in the ways described above , it is unlikely to have some other sort of problem that we never anticipated ( though this does happen occasionally ) . However , some free software licenses are based on contracts , and contracts can impose a much larger range of possible restrictions . That means there are many possible ways such a license could be unacceptably restrictive and nonfree . We ca n ' t possibly list all the ways that might happen . If a contract-based license restricts the user in an unusual way that copyright-based licenses can not , and which is n't mentioned here as legitimate , we will have to think about it , and we will probably conclude it is nonfree . When talking about free software , it is best to avoid using terms like "" give away "" or "" for free , "" because those terms imply that the issue is about price , not freedom . Some common terms such as "" piracy "" embody opinions we hope you wo n ' t endorse . See Confusing Words and Phrases that are Worth Avoiding for a discussion of these terms . We also have a list of proper translations of "" free software "" into various languages . Finally , note that criteria such as those stated in this free software definition require careful thought for their interpretation . To decide whether a specific software license qualifies as a free software license , we judge it based on these criteria to determine whether it fits their spirit as well as the precise words . If a license includes unconscionable restrictions , we reject it , even if we did not anticipate the issue in these criteria . Sometimes a license requirement raises an issue that calls for extensive thought , including discussions with a lawyer , before we can decide if the requirement is acceptable . When we reach a conclusion about a new issue , we often update these criteria to make it easier to see why certain licenses do or do n't qualify . If you are interested in whether a specific license qualifies as a free software license , see our list of licenses . If the license you are concerned with is not listed there , you can ask us about it by sending us email at < licensing@gnu.org > . If you are contemplating writing a new license , please contact the Free Software Foundation first by writing to that address . The proliferation of different free software licenses means increased work for users in understanding the licenses ; we may be able to help you find an existing free software license that meets your needs . If that is n't possible , if you really need a new license , with our help you can ensure that the license really is a free software license and avoid various practical problems . Beyond Software Software manuals must be free , for the same reasons that software must be free , and because the manuals are in effect part of the software . The same arguments also make sense for other kinds of works of practical use – that is to say , works that embody useful knowledge , such as educational works and reference works . Wikipedia is the best-known example . Any kind of work can be free , and the definition of free software has been extended to a definition of free cultural works applicable to any kind of works . Open Source ? Another group has started using the term "" open source "" to mean something close ( but not identical ) to "" free software . "" We prefer the term "" free software "" because , once you have heard that it refers to freedom rather than price , it calls to mind freedom . The word "" open "" never refers to freedom ."	0

193	"COMMITTEE ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD Thirty-third session 19 May-6 June 2003 General comment No. 4 ( 2003 ) Adolescent health and development in the context of the Convention on the Rights of the Child Introduction The Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as "" every human being below the age of 18 years unless , under the law applicable , majority is attained earlier "" ( art . 1 ) . Consequently , adolescents up to 18 years old are holders of all the rights enshrined in the Convention ; they are entitled to special protection measures and , according to their evolving capacities , they can progressively exercise their rights ( art . Adolescence is a period characterized by rapid physical , cognitive and social changes , including sexual and reproductive maturation ; the gradual building up of the capacity to assume adult behaviours and roles involving new responsibilities requiring new knowledge and skills . While adolescents are in general a healthy population group , adolescence also poses new challenges to health and development owing to their relative vulnerability and pressure from society , including peers , to adopt risky health behaviour . These challenges include developing an individual identity and dealing with one's sexuality . The dynamic transition period to adulthood is also generally a period of positive changes , prompted by the significant capacity of adolescents to learn rapidly , to experience new and diverse situations , to develop and use critical thinking , to familiarize themselves with freedom , to be creative and to socialize . The Committee on the Rights of the Child notes with concern that in implementing their obligations under the Convention , States parties have not given sufficient attention to the specific concerns of adolescents as rights holders and to promoting their health and development . This has motivated the Committee to adopt the present general comment in order to raise awareness and provide States parties with guidance and support in their efforts to guarantee the respect for , protection and fulfilment of the rights of adolescents , including through the formulation of specific strategies and policies . The Committee understands the concepts of "" health and development "" more broadly than being strictly limited to the provisions defined in articles 6 ( right to life , survival and development ) and 24 ( right to health ) of the Convention . One of the aims of this general comment is precisely to identify the main human rights that need to be promoted and protected in order to ensure that adolescents do enjoy the highest attainable standard of health , develop in a well-balanced manner , and are adequately prepared to enter adulthood and assume a constructive role in their communities and in society at large . This general comment should be read in conjunction with the Convention and its two Optional Protocols on the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography , and on the involvement of children in armed conflict , as well as other relevant international human rights norms and standards . Fundamental principles and other obligations of states parties As recognized by the World Conference on Human Rights ( 1993 ) and repeatedly stated by the Committee , children's rights too are indivisible and interrelated . In addition to articles 6 and 24 , other provisions and principles of the Convention are crucial in guaranteeing that adolescents fully enjoy their right to health and development . The right to non-discrimination States parties have the obligation to ensure that all human beings below 18 enjoy all the rights set forth in the Convention without discrimination ( art . 2 ) , including with regard to "" race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , property , disability , birth or other status "" . These grounds also cover adolescents' sexual orientation and health status ( including HIV / AIDS and mental health ) . Adolescents who are subject to discrimination are more vulnerable to abuse , other types of violence and exploitation , and their health and development are put at greater risk . They are therefore entitled to special attention and protection from all segments of society . Appropriate guidance in the exercise of rights The Convention acknowledges the responsibilities , rights and duties of parents ( or other persons legally responsible for the child ) "" to provide , in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child , appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the Convention "" ( art . The Committee believes that parents or other persons legally responsible for the child need to fulfil with care their right and responsibility to provide direction and guidance to their adolescent children in the exercise by the latter of their rights . They have an obligation to take into account the adolescents' views , in accordance with their age and maturity , and to provide a safe and supportive environment in which the adolescent can develop . Adolescents need to be recognized by the members of their family environment as active rights holders who have the capacity to become full and responsible citizens , given the proper guidance and direction . Respect for the views of the child The right to express views freely and have them duly taken into account ( art . 12 ) is also fundamental in realizing adolescents' right to health and development . States parties need to ensure that adolescents are given a genuine chance to express their views freely on all matters affecting them , especially within the family , in school , and in their communities . In order for adolescents to be able safely and properly to exercise this right , public authorities , parents and other adults working with or for children need to create an environment based on trust , information-sharing , the capacity to listen and sound guidance that is conducive for adolescents' participating equally including in decision-making processes . Legal and judicial measures and processes Under article 4 of the Convention , "" States parties shall undertake all appropriate legislative , administrative and other measures for the implementation of the rights recognized "" therein . In the context of the rights of adolescents to health and development , States parties need to ensure that specific legal provisions are guaranteed under domestic law , including with regard to setting a minimum age for sexual consent , marriage and the possibility of medical treatment without parental consent . These minimum ages should be the same for boys and girls ( article 2 of the Convention ) and closely reflect the recognition of the status of human beings under 18 years of age as rights holders , in accordance with their evolving capacity , age and maturity ( arts . 5 and 12 to 17 ) . Further , adolescents need to have easy access to individual complaint systems as well as judicial and appropriate non-judicial redress mechanisms that guarantee fair and due process , with special attention to the right to privacy ( art . Civil rights and freedoms The Convention defines the civil rights and freedoms of children and adolescents in its articles 13 to 17 . These are fundamental in guaranteeing the right to health and development of adolescents . Article 17 states that the child has the right to "" access information and material from a diversity of national and international sources , especially those aimed at the promotion of his or her social , spiritual and moral well-being and physical and mental health "" . The right of adolescents to access appropriate information is crucial if States parties are to promote cost-effective measures , including through laws , policies and programmes , with regard to numerous health-related situations , including those covered in articles 24 and 33 such as family planning , prevention of accidents , protection from harmful traditional practices , including early marriages and female genital mutilation , and the abuse of alcohol , tobacco and other harmful substances . In order to promote the health and development of adolescents , States parties are also encouraged to respect strictly their right to privacy and confidentiality , including with respect to advice and counselling on health matters ( art . Health-care providers have an obligation to keep confidential medical information concerning adolescents , bearing in mind the basic principles of the Convention . Such information may only be disclosed with the consent of the adolescent , or in the same situations applying to the violation of an adult's confidentiality . Adolescents deemed mature enough to receive counselling without the presence of a parent or other person are entitled to privacy and may request confidential services , including treatment . Protection from all forms of abuse , neglect , violence and exploitation States parties must take effective measures to ensure that adolescents are protected from all forms of violence , abuse , neglect and exploitation ( arts . 19 , 32-36 and 38 ) , paying increased attention to the specific forms of abuse , neglect , violence and exploitation that affects this age group . In particular , they should adopt special measures to ensure the physical , sexual and mental integrity of adolescents with disabilities , who are particularly vulnerable to abuse and neglect . States parties should also ensure that adolescents affected by poverty who are socially marginalized are not criminalized . In this regard , financial and human resources need to be allocated to promote research that would inform the adoption of effective local and national laws , policies and programmes . Policies and strategies should be reviewed regularly and revised accordingly . In taking these measures , States parties have to take into account the evolving capacities of adolescents and involve them in an appropriate manner in developing measures , including programmes , designed to protect them . In this context , the Committee emphasizes the positive impact that peer education can have , and the positive influence of proper role models , especially those in the worlds of arts , entertainment and sports . Data collection Systematic data collection is necessary for States parties to be able to monitor the health and development of adolescents . States parties should adopt data-collection mechanisms that allow desegregation by sex , age , origin and socio-economic status so that the situation of different groups can be followed . Data should also be collected to study the situation of specific groups such as ethnic and / or indigenous minorities , migrant or refugee adolescents , adolescents with disabilities , working adolescents , etc. Where appropriate , adolescents should participate in the analysis to ensure that the information is understood and utilized in an adolescent-sensitive way . Creating a safe and supportive environment The health and development of adolescents are strongly determined by the environments in which they live . Creating a safe and supportive environment entails addressing attitudes and actions of both the immediate environment of the adolescent - family , peers , schools and services - as well as the wider environment created by , inter alia , community and religious leaders , the media , national and local policies and legislation . The promotion and enforcement of the provisions and principles of the Convention , especially articles 2-6 , 12-17 , 24 , 28 , 29 and 31 , are key to guaranteeing adolescents' right to health and development . States parties should take measures to raise awareness and stimulate and / or regulate action through the formulation of policy or the adoption of legislation and the implementation of programmes specifically for adolescents . The Committee stresses the importance of the family environment , including the members of the extended family and community or other persons legally responsible for the child or adolescent ( arts . 5 and 18 ) . While most adolescents grow up in well-functioning family environments , for some the family does not constitute a safe and supportive milieu . The Committee calls upon States parties to develop and implement , in a manner consistent with adolescents' evolving capacities , legislation , policies and programmes to promote the health and development of adolescents by ( a ) providing parents ( or legal guardians ) with appropriate assistance through the development of institutions , facilities and services that adequately support the well-being of adolescents , including , when needed , the provision of material assistance and support with regard to nutrition , clothing and housing ( art . 27 ( 3 )) ; ( b ) providing adequate information and parental support to facilitate the development of a relationship of trust and confidence in which issues regarding , for example , sexuality and sexual behaviour and risky lifestyles can be openly discussed and acceptable solutions found that respect the adolescent's rights ( art . 27 ( 3 )) ; ( c ) providing adolescent mothers and fathers with support and guidance for both their own and their children's well-being ( art . 24 ( f ) , 27 ( 2-3 )) ; ( d ) giving , while respecting the values and norms of ethnic and other minorities , special attention , guidance and support to adolescents and parents ( or legal guardians ) , whose traditions and norms may differ from those in the society where they live ; and ( e ) ensuring that interventions in the family to protect the adolescent and , when necessary , separate her / him from the family , e . g . in case of abuse or neglect , are in accordance with applicable laws and procedures . Such laws and procedures should be reviewed to ensure that they conform to the principles of the Convention . The school plays an important role in the life of many adolescents , as the venue for learning , development and socialization . Article 29 ( 1 ) states that education must be directed to "" the development of the child's personality , talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential "" . In addition , general comment No. 1 on the aims of education states that "" Education must also be aimed at ensuring that ... no child leaves school without being equipped to face the challenges that he or she can expect to be confronted with in life . Basic skills should include ... the ability to make well-balanced decisions ; to resolve conflicts in a non-violent manner ; and to develop a healthy lifestyle [ and ] good social relationships ... "" . Considering the importance of appropriate education for the current and future health and development of adolescents , as well as for their children , the Committee urges States parties , in line with articles 28 and 29 of the Convention to ( a ) ensure that quality primary education is compulsory and available , accessible and free to all and that secondary and higher education are available and accessible to all adolescents ; ( b ) provide well-functioning school and recreational facilities which do not pose health risks to students , including water and sanitation and safe journeys to school ; ( c ) take the necessary actions to prevent and prohibit all forms of violence and abuse , including sexual abuse , corporal punishment and other inhuman , degrading or humiliating treatment or punishment in school , by school personnel as well as among students ; ( d ) initiate and support measures , attitudes and activities that promote healthy behaviour by including relevant topics in school curricula . During adolescence , an increasing number of young people are leaving school to start working to help support their families or for wages in the formal or informal sector . Participation in work activities in accordance with international standards , as long as it does not jeopardize the enjoyment of any of the other rights of adolescents , including health and education , may be beneficial for the development of the adolescent . The Committee urges States parties to take all necessary measures to abolish all forms of child labour , starting with the worst forms , to continuously review national regulations on minimum ages for employment with a view to making them compatible with international standards , and to regulate the working environment and conditions for adolescents who are working ( in accordance with article 32 of the Convention , as well as ILO Conventions Nos. 138 and 182 ) , so as to ensure that they are fully protected and have access to legal redress mechanisms . The Committee also stresses that in accordance with article 23 ( 3 ) of the Convention , the special rights of adolescents with disabilities should be taken into account and assistance provided to ensure that the disabled child / adolescent has effective access to and receives good quality education . States should recognize the principle of equal primary , secondary and tertiary educational opportunities for disabled children / adolescents , where possible in regular schools . The Committee is concerned that early marriage and pregnancy are significant factors in health problems related to sexual and reproductive health , including HIV / AIDS . Both the legal minimum age and actual age of marriage , particularly for girls , are still very low in several States parties . There are also non-health-related concerns : children who marry , especially girls , are often obliged to leave the education system and are marginalized from social activities . Further , in some States parties married children are legally considered adults , even if they are under 18 , depriving them of all the special protection measures they are entitled under the Convention . The Committee strongly recommends that States parties review and , where necessary , reform their legislation and practice to increase the minimum age for marriage with and without parental consent to 18 years , for both girls and boys . The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has made a similar recommendation ( general comment No. 21 of 1994 ) . In most countries accidental injuries or injuries due to violence are a leading cause of death or permanent disability among adolescents . In that respect , the Committee is concerned about the injuries and death resulting from road traffic accidents , which affect adolescents disproportionately . States parties should adopt and enforce legislation and programmes to improve road safety , including driving education for and examination of adolescents and the adoption or strengthening of legislation known to be highly effective such as the obligations to have a valid driver's licence , wear seat belts and crash helmets , and the designation of pedestrian areas . The Committee is also very concerned about the high rate of suicide among this age group . Mental disorders and psychosocial illness are relatively common among adolescents . In many countries symptoms such as depression , eating disorders and self-destructive behaviours , sometimes leading to self-inflicted injuries and suicide , are increasing . They may be related to , inter alia , violence , ill-treatment , abuse and neglect , including sexual abuse , unrealistically high expectations , and / or bullying or hazing in and outside school . States parties should provide these adolescents with all the necessary services . Violence results from a complex interplay of individual , family , community and societal factors . Vulnerable adolescents such as those who are homeless or who are living in institutions , who belong to gangs or who have been recruited as child soldiers are especially exposed to both institutional and interpersonal violence . Under article 19 of the Convention , States parties must take all appropriate measures to prevent and eliminate : ( a ) institutional violence against adolescents , including through legislation and administrative measures in relation to public and private institutions for adolescents ( schools , institutions for disabled adolescents , juvenile reformatories , etc. ) , and training and monitoring of personnel in charge of institutionalized children or who otherwise have contact with children through their work , including the police ; and ( b ) interpersonal violence among adolescents , including by supporting adequate parenting and opportunities for social and educational development in early childhood , fostering non-violent cultural norms and values ( as foreseen in article 29 of the Convention ) , strictly controlling firearms and restricting access to alcohol and drugs . In light of articles 3 , 6 , 12 , 19 and 24 ( 3 ) of the Convention , States parties should take all effective measures to eliminate all acts and activities which threaten the right to life of adolescents , including honour killings . The Committee strongly urges States parties to develop and implement awareness-raising campaigns , education programmes and legislation aimed at changing prevailing attitudes , and address gender roles and stereotypes that contribute to harmful traditional practices . Further , States parties should facilitate the establishment of multidisciplinary information and advice centres regarding the harmful aspects of some traditional practices , including early marriage and female genital mutilation . The Committee is concerned about the influence exerted on adolescent health behaviours by the marketing of unhealthy products and lifestyles . In line with article 17 of the Convention , States parties are urged to protect adolescents from information that is harmful to their health and development , while underscoring their right to information and material from diverse national and international sources . States parties are therefore urged to regulate or prohibit information on and marketing of substances such as alcohol and tobacco , particularly when it targets children and adolescents . Information , skills development , counselling , and health services Adolescents have the right to access adequate information essential for their health and development and for their ability to participate meaningfully in society . It is the obligation of States parties to ensure that all adolescent girls and boys , both in and out of school , are provided with , and not denied , accurate and appropriate information on how to protect their health and development and practise healthy behaviours . This should include information on the use and abuse , of tobacco , alcohol and other substances , safe and respectful social and sexual behaviours , diet and physical activity . In order to act adequately on the information , adolescents need to develop the skills necessary , including self-care skills , such as how to plan and prepare nutritionally balanced meals and proper personal hygiene habits , and skills for dealing with particular social situations such as interpersonal communication , decision-making , and coping with stress and conflict . States parties should stimulate and support opportunities to build such skills through , inter alia , formal and informal education and training programmes , youth organizations and the media . In light of articles 3 , 17 and 24 of the Convention , States parties should provide adolescents with access to sexual and reproductive information , including on family planning and contraceptives , the dangers of early pregnancy , the prevention of HIV / AIDS and the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) . In addition , States parties should ensure that they have access to appropriate information , regardless of their marital status and whether their parents or guardians consent . It is essential to find proper means and methods of providing information that is adequate and sensitive to the particularities and specific rights of adolescent girls and boys . To this end , States parties are encouraged to ensure that adolescents are actively involved in the design and dissemination of information through a variety of channels beyond the school , including youth organizations , religious , community and other groups and the media . Under article 24 of the Convention , States parties are urged to provide adequate treatment and rehabilitation for adolescents with mental disorders , to make the community aware of the early signs and symptoms and the seriousness of these conditions , and to protect adolescents from undue pressures , including psychosocial stress . States parties are also urged to combat discrimination and stigma surrounding mental disorders , in line with their obligations under article 2 . Every adolescent with a mental disorder has the right to be treated and cared for , as far as possible , in the community in which he or she lives . Where hospitalization or placement in a psychiatric institution is necessary , this decision should be made in accordance with the principle of the best interests of the child . In the event of hospitalization or institutionalization , the patient should be given the maximum possible opportunity to enjoy all his or her rights as recognized under the Convention , including the rights to education and to have access to recreational activities . Where appropriate , adolescents should be separated from adults . States parties must ensure that adolescents have access to a personal representative other than a family member to represent their interests , when necessary and appropriate . In accordance with article 25 of the Convention , States parties should undertake periodic review of the placement of adolescents in hospitals or psychiatric institutions . Adolescents , both girls and boys , are at risk of being infected with and affected by STDs , including HIV / AIDS . States should ensure that appropriate goods , services and information for the prevention and treatment of STDs , including HIV / AIDS , are available and accessible . To this end , States parties are urged ( a ) to develop effective prevention programmes , including measures aimed at changing cultural views about adolescents' need for contraception and STD prevention and addressing cultural and other taboos surrounding adolescent sexuality ; ( b ) to adopt legislation to combat practices that either increase adolescents' risk of infection or contribute to the marginalization of adolescents who are already infected with STDs , including HIV ; ( c ) to take measures to remove all barriers hindering the access of adolescents to information , preventive measures such as condoms , and care . Adolescent girls should have access to information on the harm that early marriage and early pregnancy can cause , and those who become pregnant should have access to health services that are sensitive to their rights and particular needs . States parties should take measures to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in adolescent girls , particularly caused by early pregnancy and unsafe abortion practices , and to support adolescent parents . Young mothers , especially where support is lacking , may be prone to depression and anxiety , compromising their ability to care for their child . The Committee urges States parties ( a ) to develop and implement programmes that provide access to sexual and reproductive health services , including family planning , contraception and safe abortion services where abortion is not against the law , adequate and comprehensive obstetric care and counselling ; ( b ) to foster positive and supportive attitudes towards adolescent parenthood for their mothers and fathers ; and ( c ) to develop policies that will allow adolescent mothers to continue their education . Before parents give their consent , adolescents need to have a chance to express their views freely and their views should be given due weight , in accordance with article 12 of the Convention . However , if the adolescent is of sufficient maturity , informed consent shall be obtained from the adolescent her / himself , while informing the parents if that is in the "" best interest of the child "" ( art . With regard to privacy and confidentiality , and the related issue of informed consent to treatment , States parties should ( a ) enact laws or regulations to ensure that confidential advice concerning treatment is provided to adolescents so that they can give their informed consent . Such laws or regulations should stipulate an age for this process , or refer to the evolving capacity of the child ; and ( b ) provide training for health personnel on the rights of adolescents to privacy and confidentiality , to be informed about planned treatment and to give their informed consent to treatment . Vulnerability and risk In ensuring respect for the right of adolescents to health and development , both individual behaviours and environmental factors which increase their vulnerability and risk should be taken into consideration . Environmental factors , such as armed conflict or social exclusion , increase the vulnerability of adolescents to abuse , other forms of violence and exploitation , thereby severely limiting adolescents' abilities to make individual , healthy behaviour choices . For example , the decision to engage in unsafe sex increases adolescents' risk of ill-health . In accordance with article 23 of the Convention , adolescents with mental and / or physical disabilities have an equal right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health . States parties have an obligation to provide adolescents with disabilities with the means necessary to realize their rights . States parties should ( a ) ensure that health facilities , goods and services are available and accessible to all adolescents with disabilities and that these facilities and services promote their self-reliance and their active participation in the community ; ( b ) ensure that the necessary equipment and personal support are available to enable them to move around , participate and communicate ; ( c ) pay specific attention to the special needs relating to the sexuality of adolescents with disabilities ; and ( d ) remove barriers that hinder adolescents with disabilities in realizing their rights . States parties have to provide special protection to homeless adolescents , including those working in the informal sector . Homeless adolescents are particularly vulnerable to violence , abuse and sexual exploitation from others , self-destructive behaviour , substance abuse and mental disorders . In this regard , States parties are required to ( a ) develop policies and enact and enforce legislation that protect such adolescents from violence , e . g . by law enforcement officials ; ( b ) develop strategies for the provision of appropriate education and access to health care , and of opportunities for the development of livelihood skills . Adolescents who are sexually exploited , including in prostitution and pornography , are exposed to significant health risks , including STDs , HIV / AIDS , unwanted pregnancies , unsafe abortions , violence and psychological distress . They have the right to physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration in an environment that fosters health , self-respect and dignity ( art . It is the obligation of States parties to enact and enforce laws to prohibit all forms of sexual exploitation and related trafficking ; to collaborate with other States parties to eliminate intercountry trafficking ; and to provide appropriate health and counselling services to adolescents who have been sexually exploited , making sure that they are treated as victims and not as offenders . Additionally , adolescents experiencing poverty , armed conflicts , all forms of injustice , family breakdown , political , social and economic instability and all types of migration may be particularly vulnerable . These situations might seriously hamper their health and development . By investing heavily in preventive policies and measures States parties can drastically reduce levels of vulnerability and risk factors ; they will also provide cost-effective ways for society to help adolescents develop harmoniously in a free society . Nature of States' obligations In exercising their obligations in relation to the health and development of adolescents , States parties shall always take fully into account the four general principles of the Convention . It is the view of the Committee that States parties must take all appropriate legislative , administrative and other measures for the realization and monitoring of the rights of adolescents to health and development as recognized in the Convention . To this end , States parties must notably fulfil the following obligations : ( a ) To create a safe and supportive environment for adolescents , including within their family , in schools , in all types of institutions in which they may live , within their workplace and / or in the society at large ; ( b ) To ensure that adolescents have access to the information that is essential for their health and development and that they have opportunities to participate in decisions affecting their health ( notably through informed consent and the right of confidentiality ) , to acquire life skills , to obtain adequate and age-appropriate information , and to make appropriate health behaviour choices ; ( c ) To ensure that health facilities , goods and services , including counselling and health services for mental and sexual and reproductive health , of appropriate quality and sensitive to adolescents' concerns are available to all adolescents ; ( d ) To ensure that adolescent girls and boys have the opportunity to participate actively in planning and programming for their own health and development ; ( e ) To protect adolescents from all forms of labour which may jeopardize the enjoyment of their rights , notably by abolishing all forms of child labour and by regulating the working environment and conditions in accordance with international standards ; ( f ) To protect adolescents from all forms of intentional and unintentional injuries , including those resulting from violence and road traffic accidents ; ( g ) To protect adolescents from all harmful traditional practices , such as early marriages , honour killings and female genital mutilation ; ( h ) To ensure that adolescents belonging to especially vulnerable groups are fully taken into account in the fulfilment of all aforementioned obligations ; ( i ) To implement measures for the prevention of mental disorders and the promotion of mental health of adolescents . The Committee draws the attention of States parties to the general comment No. 14 on the right to the highest attainable standard of health of the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights which states that , "" States parties should provide a safe and supportive environment for adolescents that ensures the opportunity to participate in decisions affecting their health , to build life skills , to acquire appropriate information , to receive counselling and to negotiate the health-behaviour choices they make . The realization of the right to health of adolescents is dependent on the development of youth-sensitive health care , which respects confidentiality and privacy and includes appropriate sexual and reproductive health services . "" In accordance with articles 24 , 39 and other related provisions of the Convention , States parties should provide health services that are sensitive to the particular needs and human rights of all adolescents , paying attention to the following characteristics : ( a ) Availability . Primary health care should include services sensitive to the needs of adolescents , with special attention given to sexual and reproductive health and mental health ; ( b ) Accessibility . Health facilities , goods and services should be known and easily accessible ( economically , physically and socially ) to all adolescents , without discrimination . Confidentiality should be guaranteed , when necessary ; ( c ) Acceptability . While fully respecting the provisions and principles of the Convention , all health facilities , goods and services should respect cultural values , be gender sensitive , be respectful of medical ethics and be acceptable to both adolescents and the communities in which they live ; ( d ) Quality . Health services and goods should be scientifically and medically appropriate , which requires personnel trained to care for adolescents , adequate facilities and scientifically accepted methods . States parties should , where feasible , adopt a multisectoral approach to the promotion and protection of adolescent health and development by facilitating effective and sustainable linkages and partnerships among all relevant actors . At the national level , such an approach calls for close and systematic collaboration and coordination within Government , so as to ensure the necessary involvement of all relevant government entities . Public health and other services utilized by adolescents should also be encouraged and assisted in seeking collaboration with , inter alia , private and / or traditional practitioners , professional associations , pharmacies and organizations that provide services to vulnerable groups of adolescents . A multisectoral approach to the promotion and protection of adolescent health and development will not be effective without international cooperation . Therefore , States parties should , when appropriate , seek such cooperation with United Nations specialized agencies , programmes and bodies , international NGOs and bilateral aid agencies , international professional associations and other non-State actors . Notes These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women .

357	"More information on a DIY CO2 set-up What about plant fertiler ? Try the PMDD article Question - Why do most of my plants die in around a months time ? Why do I have to keep buying some more ?!! Is it plastic fantastic for the rest of my life ? Hey , calm down , you can keep some of your plants alive even though your aquarium is low-tech . Yeah , certainly some can fail , and make no mistake , plenty of mine have . I 'm not saying that unless you have a degree in botany you will be successful , but it 's a whole lot helpful if you have some knowledge about aquatic plants . Plants need these basic few things : A good substrate ( Substrate ? You what ? ) : To start off with , you 've gone and bought some nice , coarse , gravel - no wonder your plants have problems rooting . A good substrate is really needed , and 2-3 mm , low-calcium beach gravel available from your aquatic shop will be a good start . Using this sort of substrate , allows the roots to penetrate easily , and anchors the plant - a big no-no to coarse gravel , as the plants will just give up and go home . Well , they 'll die to be precise . Other types of substrate are : Laterite : Iron-rich clays , in a reddish colour , you can buy some in your local pet shop . Why bother ? You do n't have to , but this will add some iron into the substrate . You can get it in a pellet form , where you just mix it with your normal gravel , and then add a 100 % gravel top layer . The roots can go directly into the substrate . By doing this , you do n't have to use so much fertiliser in the water column , minimise the risk of algae breakouts . And does n ' t everyone just love an algae breakout ? Sand : Using sand as a 100 % substrate can be detrimental to the plants , as it can compact quite tightly , and therefore roots can rot away in dead patches . Nutrients : A good mixture is needed if the plants are to thrive . Iron is one of the important elements , for the green pigment of plants ( chlorophyll ) . Other elements include : Manganese , Zinc , Magnesium , Copper , Boron , Potassium , Sulfur , Phosphorous , Calcium , Nitrogen . No mean list there - You may thinking , "" what am I meant to do ? Go and buy a bloody laboratory to check the amount of nutrients in my water !! "" No , its not realistic is it . Many of those nutrients will be free in your tap water , and you can buy a liquid fertiliser , or 2 , to make sure you are adding enough . Plants will also use the Nitrates in your aquarium , which is no bad thing at all . You have got to try to balance the fertiliser with the plants , and it 's a bit of a tricky old situation . If you go and drown your aquarium with fertiliser , algae can come a ' calling . For instance , Iron content does n ' t need to be anymore than 1ppm . Now what about Photosynthesis - light / CO2 ? Do I need it in a aquarium ? Of course you do !! Every plant needs this little bit of magic . And how much CO2 will be needed then ? And light ? Now its 's getting a bit trickier , you start delving into the more advanced side of the hobby . The fish in your aquarium will give off CO2 ( respiration ) , but it wo n ' t be that much . If you are really going for a heavily planted tank with some tough plants , You could add some CO2 , and place some extra bulbs in your tank . And how much CO2 would be needed for the average plant ? 15 - 30 ppm wo n ' t go too far off . A bit different from iron 1ppm hey !! And you could use a CO2 injection system . No , n o , do n't all run away , if you know what you are doing , you wont kill all of your fish in one fell swoop . I 'm not going to try explaining everything on this page , as this can be quite complex . One thing is certain - do n't go out and buy 100 lamps if you have no CO2 system , as Photosynthesis will only occur if there is a balance between light / CO2 . Water conditions : Is every plant a hardy one ? Unfortunately , no . Some need quite specific conditions - say , the "" Isoetes Setacea "" , needs these properties for it to thrive : KH : 2-5 , pH : 5 . 5-6 , and needs a lot of bright light . Now if I had a tank with the specs , let us say - about 8KH ; pH 7.5 , and one bulb , theres not much chance of me keeping this plant alive for a very long time , no matter how much fertiliser , or good substrate I have . Although plants will use Nitrates as a source of food , and your tank has levels of 20-30ppm or over , some plants can be affected badly . Only 20-30ppm ? That 's not right surely ? I hear what you say , but if you look around for pics for heavily planted tanks , often there will be a smaller population of fish compared to the normal stocking level . Here 's some info on some tough , low light plants , that anyone should be able to keep alive : Java Fern ( Microsorium pteropus ) : PH : 5.5 - 7.5 Temp : 20 - 25C KH : 2 - 12 Java Fern is very popular , you 'll probably have bought some of this already . In the natural enviroment , it creeps over logs and rockwork , attaching itself by roots . Its often used to decorate bogword , where the Rhizomes can be secured by wire or a nylon thread , until they become firmly attached . It can grow in subdued light Hygrophillia polsperma : Substrate : Plain washed gravel PH : 6.5 - 7.8 Temp : 15 - 30C KH : 2 - 15 Specs look good eh ? And it 's a very attractive plant as well . It grows rapidly in a range of water conditions , perfect to start off your aquarium with . It would like quite a bit of bright light , but you can get by with 1.5 Watts per Gallon . When it actually hits the surface of the water , it will start to run horizontally , and runners will pop out . You could cut the tops and re-plant it , it helps to rejuvinate it . Vallisneria spiralis : Substrate : Plain washed gravel PH : 6.5 - 7.5 Temp : 15 - 30C KH : 5 - 12 This is a linear , grasslike plant , perfect for a backgroud aquarium . They can grow quite rapidly , and could reach up to 60cm . Its another plant that would do well in bright light , but will tolerant light shade . It can be quite indifferent to water quality in your aquarium - buy it !!"	7

1471	"Centennial : Eight reasons to vote no How can any Centennial elected official support the Home Rule Charter , up for a vote on June 10 ? The charter fails in several areas . Here are three ; the first should give all elected Centennial officials pause and the second should make you angry . 1 . Remove Each Other ? Section 2.13 of the Charter allows for the city council and mayor to remove , with "" good cause "" , any member of the council or the mayor . What is wrong with that ? Well , you voted them in , do n't you think you should reserve the power and right to vote them out ? Why should that right be taken away from you ? Imagine a scenario where your representative is tough , challenging the status quo and probing for answers and facts . You voted him into office with a strong majority and expect him to challenge when appropriate . Now imagine another who is a strong leader , someone who can pull or bully others to their point of view . This person needs only to gather five more votes ( total of six needed ) and your elected official could be removed from office and thereby trump the voice of the people – ignoring your vote that originally placed him or her in office . 2 . Eliminate Elected Positions ? Sections 8.5 & 8.7 of the charter remove the two elected positions that you , the citizens , voted to maintain just a few years ago . The majority of the charter commissioners voted that their logic to remove the elected City Clerk and City Treasurer is superior to your vote . They are sending the unintended message that you ca n't make a good decision , and will act to make it for you . Do you feel compelled to trust this charter when your vote and will is ignored ? 3 . Sky 's the Limit ? The charter codifies the idea that Centennial is not to be a virtual city – the vision initially projected when the city incorporated seven years ago . How does the charter do this ? The very essence of Home Rule grants a municipality the power to self-govern ; to become whatever the city wants to become by passing legislation . No longer constrained by state statues , the city can increase its tax base , staff , overhead , and spending . All tax increases will go to the voters for approval , but the city can commit us to spending without your vote ( e.g. public works , increased staffing , etc. ) . Still uncertain ? Here are another five other points to justify voting no . 4 . Trust . Where is your level of trust given these three points above ? Do you remember when the city incorporated , and promises were made to have low sales tax ( 1 . 5 % ) , no automobile tax , and no city hall ( "" virtual "" only ) ? All have evolved away from those initial promises . It is a matter of trust . 5 . Amendments . Supporters say "" let 's just pass this now and we 'll fix it later ... we 'll add amendments "" . In other words , the same people who do n't trust you and your vote are asking you to trust them – that they know how to handle this and that we need only to have faith that all will be well . Trust them that the will of the people will be heard – that the appropriate amendments will be added to the Charter to fix its current errors . How do you feel about that – about trusting them to do the right thing and honor your voice ? ( As you ponder this – consider the first four again . ) Bottom line : I ca n't trust that an amendment process would happen . 6 . Maturity and Vision . Because the city's 2007 vision survey only touched a tiny representation of the city ( only 400 of 103,000 residents ; or approx. 0.4 % ) , we only know the opinion of a small sampling of residents . But our city is a blend of the old and the new with visions and ideas different from one part of town to another . It is my view that we have not existed long enough to filter and vet out what "" we "" want to be . As a whole , we need more time to mature – more time to coalesce a vision that is representative of the WHOLE city and find that consensus vision . There 's no rush here ... we have all the time we need to do this right . 7 . Motive . I believe the real motive for Home Rule is NOT about self-determination . Yes , the charter will provide self-determination , but the driving motive of our mayor and his supporters in pushing Home Rule is about money . Why the big rush to pass the Charter now ? It 's all about taxes and revenue . Why more money ? To pay for more city buildings , more city staff , and more city benefits . Clearly , more money means more government . Do n't ' get me wrong – government has a place in our lives , an important role . But we do not need more government trucks or buildings . We do n't need to grow the city staff , again . We need our city officials to keep the city fiscally healthy by operating as a virtual city – the city that leaders promised you seven years ago . 8 . Next Steps . What happens if the Charter vote fails ? Several next steps will occur . First , the Charter Commission will go back to work on the Charter – hopefully to correct the gaps and errors of the current version . Also , all will hear your clear voice in the choir of the whole express the sentiment and will of the people – "" we are not to be ignored nor our votes trumped "" . Most importantly , the city does n't get more money . The city council and mayor will be forced and challenged to find ways to cut spending to meet the budget , instead of reaching to grab more revenue to grow government . I think that is a good thing . I 've outlined eight points that justify a "" NO "" vote on your mail-in ballot . This Memorial Day , as you receive your ballots , remember those who stood up for you and me – fighting to ensure that our voices and that our vote would mean something . Send a message and join me – vote "" NO "" and do not adopt this charter . Ron , Here are 8 Reasons citizens feel the charter should be passed : 1 . ) Additional and earlier campaign finance report filing than currently required as a statutory city . This way citizens will know who and which organizations are funding their campaigns in time to cast their vote . 2 . ) More Council Members to vote in agreement ( at least 5 votes to increase franchise fees and 6 votes to pass an emergency ordinance or impose eminent domain . ) Without the charter , council currently passes this level of legislation with only a vote of 3 or 4 councilmembers . 3 . ) A capital program for all long range city planning . Without this level of transparency provided in the charter , it 's very difficult for the average citizen to learn how their tax dollars are actually being spent . 4 . ) Empowering citizens to recall Council Members more efficiently than the way the city currently operates . Currently , citizens need to wait a full 180 days to initiate a recall petition . The charter cuts that time in half . 5 . ) Ensuring there will always be a vote of the people before any new taxes can be imposed or tax rates increased , even if TABOR is repealed . 6 . ) Centennial will be more able to mandate land use for special districts and government facilities . For instance , anyone who has tried to find a parking space around Arapho Park – owned by South Suburban – knows what this means . As a statutory city , the city can not require South Suburban to provide adequate parking for "" active "" uses on the park . We also can not require appropriate access , or design and landscaping meet our standards . 7 . ) Gives citizens more control over their own city government . Currently , if citizens want to change the city government in some way that is dictated in the state statutes , they must get the state legislature to write the change into law . By becoming a Home Rule city , citizens have more flexibility to propose ordinances , initiate and initiate an amendment to the Charter . 8 . ) More control over money owed the City . You ask , "" Why more money ? "" It 's not about more money – it 's about collecting money Centennial citizens have already paid ! And that will help to keep our taxes low and provide city services . Currently , Centennial can not collect its own sales tax from businesses . Since zip codes do not conform to municipal boundaries , many businesses are n't collecting Centennial city sales tax , but are collecting the higher rate of Aurora , Greenwood Village , Englewood , or Littleton and then disbursing the money to those cities . Oh , and one last reason : Remember the definition of insanity ? Doing the same old thing and expecting new results ? Remaining a statutory keeps us in the same-old , same old . SPIRIT OF 1776"	0
1487	"Drama – Dramatic activities such as skits , recitations , puppet shows and simple storytelling can let a child concentrate on being a different character for a short time . Put a costume on them and watch how quickly they start getting into character . However , it may take direction from you to keep them focused and enjoying the event . Costumes need not be elaborate to let a child be another character . It need only be representational . A single feather in a headband , a necktie , a hat , sunglasses , scrubs or even just a sign or patch fastened to clothing is enough to let a child jump into another role . Let the child use his or her imagination to help find costume pieces as part of the dramatic play process . And do n't restrict them to the costume box . Colanders make great space helmets . When Sid's children were growing up , they had a "" costume closet "" with an assortment of coats , brightly colored shirts , hats and accessories such as scarves , belts , wigs and , of course , masks . If an article of clothing became outdated , before disposing of it , they 'd consider its costume potential . Putting together a costume for Halloween was always a big event . On top of that , living in New Orleans offered them Mardi Gras as a second costuming event each year . Playhouses and play tents – Giving a child a space of his or her own is a great way to encourage imaginative pretend play . Whether it 's stretching a sheet over dining room chairs to make a house or a purchased indoor or outdoor playhouse or play tent with a theme , a child is free to role-play and make up scenarios that could happen in the space . At The Creativity Institute , we carry several types of playhouses , play tents and tunnels in themes that include a teepee , theater tent , castle and military camouflage . We also carry puppet theaters that can double as play stores and other types of play spaces . Our big foam blocks are large enough to construct make-believe buildings and tunnels a child can climb over and under . We also have play panels that can be moved around to create an ever-changing mix of play environments . This type of pretend play is also conducive to playing with others , offering an opportunity for a child to develop those all-important socialization skills . Puppet shows – Puppets allow a child to act out many different roles and have fun with character voices . There are many sources for skits that can be adapted to the puppet stage and even ready-to-perform scripts in your library and on the Web . At The Creativity Institute , we have a section devoted to puppetry with puppets and puppet theaters . You 'll find links to script resources on the Internet , puppeteer tips and even a free sample scripts we adapted for the puppet stage . To make it easier to get started , we 've bundled together puppets and puppet theater packages and even grouped puppet casts with accompanying scripts , ready to perform . There 's an Aesop's Fables Puppet Starter Set with five puppets and four fables adapted to the puppet stage . There 's also an Old MacDonald Puppet Starter Set with Farmer MacDonald and seven barnyard animal puppets and an accompanying script of the song . Again , your direction will be invaluable in providing enough structure for the event that will let the children have a greater sense of accomplishment and stay interested longer . And because puppets offer a degree of separation from real issues , they can offer lots of opportunities for learning about inappropriate behaviors . For example , if a child with ADHD has been overly aggressive with other children , acting out the consequences with animal puppets can offer a more painless and effective lesson . Record it – Getting the performances down on tape gives everyone more opportunities to laugh and enjoy it all over again . There 's a difference between taping the children playing at creating the performance and "" making a movie "" of the show , and both are wonderful to watch again and again . Taping the children at play shows their performance , as well as the behind-the-scenes preparation . Making a movie is just a matter of trying to capture what the audience would see . All you have to do is prepare the children for the scene and start and stop the camera at the right times – and move on . You can even start with a title card the children can make for the show – using their own artistic skills . If the child acts out while taping is underway , continue shooting , but keep your reprimands to a minimum . Put your energy into trying to refocus the child's attention toward continuing the performance or easing into a hastier conclusion . Later , when viewing the tape , the child may be able to see problem behaviors more clearly , rather than focusing more on your anger . Dollhouses and activity sets – Playing with dolls and action figures is another valuable opportunity for pretend play . Dollhouses , toy pirate ships , castles , firehouses , farms and other traditional activity sets have the magic to let children get lost in their imaginations . Even the more popular activity sets based on movies and TV shows allow the same opportunities . And do n't forget what imaginations can do with boxes , blocks and anything that can become the setting for a creative play session . Blocks – Toys for children with ADHD should be simple and encourage the use of their imaginations , and one of the most basic of toys is building blocks . Block play can be great for many ages . From simple stack-up and knock-over fun to imaginative building . Blocks teach problem-solving skills , because a child discovers how stacking and matching can produce different results . They can also become components of pretend play , because a child can fantasize what the structures are . There are also big foam blocks that are almost "" life size "" and let children create their own fantasy playhouses . These lightweight blocks are so versatile , they can be climbed on or tunneled under . Magnetic block and construction sets have pieces that connect in more ways than can conventional plastic snap-together blocks and allow even more imaginative opportunities . We also carry a selection of traditional and colorful wooden blocks that are full of fantasy building opportunities . Blocks , like many traditional toys , have other educational advantages for a child with ADHD . The number of positive outcomes is limitless , so children can continue playing until they 've reached a level of personal satisfaction . Whether the child is building with traditional blocks or shoeboxes , try to show interest in every structure . Encourage the child to name creations , even if it 's simply Wobbly Land or Crazy Tower . Showing interest without criticism offers your child valuable , long-lasting affirmation . Art Activities – Any medium such as crayons , markers , chalk , paint and clay can give a child a wealth of expressive opportunities . Sometimes you may want to suggest a subject idea to get them started . Art supplies are some of the least expensive educational toys you can provide . Gwynn used to bring home old stationery and unused printed samples to give her children a virtually unlimited supply of art paper . She 'd also purchase low-end copy paper , offering the kids free rein on a giant stack of blank paper . And here 's something you can try on a big scale . Sid used to get leftover paper billboards from the local outdoor company and tack them on his backyard fence , backside out , to give the children blank giant-size panels for murals . The change in scale of their artist's canvas gets them thinking of possibilities in a different perspective and keeps them intrigued for hours . Another way to give structure to art activities is with their own easel . We carry a selection of folding , double-sided and adjustable easels that provide a convenient supply of paper and drawing surfaces in a self-contained , accessible environment . One rule of thumb to follow to help inspire your kids to express themselves is to encourage all efforts . Today's crooked stick figure could lead to tomorrow's Picasso . Most important , artistic expression is highly therapeutic to your child , even if it does n't happen to please your eye . Books – There are many books that can hold a child's attention . The public library is a great start and your librarian can help you . Garage sales and community book fairs are a great way to build a library of your own . Collections of rhymes , poems or short stories are a good way to start with a child who is easily distracted . The Oppenheim Toy Portfolio listed the top toys for children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and included , among other things , a magnetic construction set , a tree-house-theme dollhouse play set , a decorate-it-yourself birdfeeder , board games and a simple , basic rubber ball . Oppenheim also suggested the toy general categories of dramatic play and artistic activities . * The National Institute of Mental Health recommends that if ADHD is suspected , the diagnosis should be made by a professional with training in ADHD . This includes child psychiatrists , psychologists , developmental / behavioral pediatricians , behavioral neurologists and clinical social workers . After ruling out other possible reasons for the child's behavior , the specialist checks the child's school and medical records and talks to teachers and parents who have filled out a behavior rating scale for the child . A diagnosis is made only after all this information has been considered ."	7

1148	"Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick lend their pipes to otherwise generic kids' movie based on vintage toy line They 're small , squat and fuzzy , with ridiculous hair and a love of anonymous mischief-making ... but enough about folks who haunt comments sections and blow up Twitter feeds . This DreamWorks animation joint revolves around a different type of troll , specifically those vintage miniature dolls blessed with drunken-pug faces and gravity-defying ' dos . Having licensed the IP for the purposes of big-screen toysploitation , the company has come up with a story in which our furry little friends are pursued by giants known as Bergens ; if these miserable , ogre-like creatures consume a troll on a holiday known as "" Trollstice , "" they allegedly experience a momentary sense of happiness . One massive underground escape later , the diminutive would-be desserts flee to the forest to live in peace , harmony and endless pop song singalongs . Years later , their trolltopia is threatened when an exiled Bergen chef ( Christine Baranski ) discovers their whereabouts and hopes to revive the tradition . Only the insanely optimistic Princess Poppy ( Anna Kendrick ) and her pessimistic friend Branch ( Justin Timberlake ) can rescue their troll-napped friends . Yadda yadda yadda . Related From Pixar landmarks to cyberpunk anime and stop-motion indies – our top non-live-action films and toons of all time Forget the story , which borrows from virtually every other feature-length cartoon you 've seen over the last decade , as well as Cinderella , Cyrano de Bergerac and the Campbellian hero's journey template . This is really just an excuse to for celebrities to nab plum voiceover paydays – an A-list roll call includes Zooey Deschanel , Russell Brand , Gwen Stefani , James Corden and Jeffrey Tambor – for directors / Shrek franchise veterans Mike Mitchell and Walt Dohrn to roll out platitudes about finding your bliss , for corporate music-licensing liasons to justify their jobs ( the soundtrack is a karaoke machine's wet dream ) and for folks to indulge in the sort of aggressively positive vibe that makes The Lego Movie feel damned near postapocalyptic . One character farts glitter and another poops cupcakes . You could not ask for better in-movie metaphors . Where Trolls does rise above your run-of-the-mill children's entertainment is its animation , which veers between artisanally crude felt-cut-out interludes and computer-rendered scenes emphasizing every strand of the trolls ' vertical , rainbow-ready hair . Rarely has so much care been made to show so much texture in an animated film , from the characters' downy skin to the background flora that seems wonderfully tactile and almost hand-made . There 's a distinct arts-and-craft look to everything . You wonder if the project was given a grant by Etsy . And to say it 's colorful is an understatement ; the variety of retina-searing primary and pastel hues hurled at your eyeballs at any and every given moment falls somewhere between a Skittles factory's inventory and a psychedelic drug trip . ( This is truly a kids' movie designed for toddlers and your uncle that did too much Orange Sunshine that one time and never fully recovered . ) If you 've ever been curious as to how far a studio toon could push the doors of perception in terms of a visual palette , or simply wondered what a Kendrick / Timberlake duet of "" True Colors "" would sound like , Trolls will answer these questions in between sandblasting you with manufactured joy . Otherwise , this is one of those time-killers that 's impossibly exuberant , insanely likable and instantly forgettable .

649	"I 'm 23 years old , I live with my parents and I am currently out of work . When I was younger , about 15 , I was a bit wayward . ( I suppose most teenagers are at some time ) . After I had left school I did n't have much going for me . One day early in 1997 I decided that I should do something with my life . I took a big step ; I went to live with some friends in Liverpool . After I had been there about two weeks I had got myself a job as a security officer , shortly after that I found myself a nice flat ( first floor ) . Things were looking up . Work was going well and I had the opportunity to apply for a site supervisor's job . I was gradually paying off my debts and everyone thought I was finally sorted out ( Including me ) . I met a man at work ; we got on well and started seeing more of each other . October 25th was his birthday and he asked me to go with him and his friends for a night out , I agreed . Whilst we were out his ex-girlfriend turned up . I was polite and tried not to upset her . The evening ended for me at the point when she attacked me . My head was bounced repeatedly off of a brick wall and as I hit the floor I was kicked in the side of my right leg . Two of his friends came with me in the ambulance to the hospital , but after I had waited about an hour I discharged myself without seeing a doctor . The next day I could hardly walk , my right knee was the size of a football and I could not turn my head . A friend came to see me and took me back to the hospital . After being kept in overnight they strapped my leg and gave me crutches put a collar on my neck and sent me home . I could n't do anything for myself , I tried to cope for about a week and then I phoned my parents and asked if I could come home . Of course two days later they came to get me . I got home on November 5th , the next day my dad took me to the local hospital . When I was finally seen by a doctor he said that the cartilage in my knee was split and that I had torn tendons and ligaments . My leg was put in a cast for three weeks to give these a chance to heal . When I had the cast removed the orthopaedic specialist was not happy , I was put on the ward and I went into surgery four hours later . I underwent an "" Arthroscopy "" , ( this is where they make two holes one each side of the knee and go inside to fix what damage there is ) . When I woke up and saw the doctor afterwards they told me that they could find no damage . I had months of physiotherapy and hydrotherapy , this helped slightly but I was still in chronic pain . For months they kept saying that they would n't give up on me , that they would find what was wrong and fix it , I believed them and lived in hope . In February 1999 a hospital specialist told me that there was nothing they could do for me , "" I 'm afraid you 'll just have to learn to live with what you 've got "" was close enough to what he said . I was angry , very angry , ( for a few days ) , then I was distraught , and as far as I could tell my life was ruined . I still suffer from severe pain and limited mobility , on a good day I only have to use one crutch but on a bad day I need both . I have to limit myself to what I can do , because there 's a lot that I would like to do but ca n't . It has taken me a long time to be able to say , "" I AM DISABLED "" and to try to believe it myself . I 've done three part-time computer courses and passed them all . I now ride a Suzuki GS750 Trike , and I also ride pillion on my fiancé's Triumph T ' Bird I can still go to rallies and shows but we have to stop quite frequently so I can rest my leg . I still have bad days ( like everyone ) but I realise now that things could be a lot worse and at least I 'm getting some of my life back ."	1
140	"I thought I 'd tell you a little about what I like to write . And I like to immerse myself in my topics . I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig . And I see my life as a series of experiments . So , I work for Esquire magazine , and a couple of years ago I wrote an article called "" My Outsourced Life , "" where I hired a team of people in Bangalore , India , to live my life for me . So they answered my emails . They answered my phone . They argued with my wife for me , and they read my son bedtime stories . It was the best month of my life , because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies . It was a wonderful experience . More recently , I wrote an article for Esquire called -- about radical honesty . And this is a movement -- this is started by a psychologist in Virginia , who says that you should never , ever lie , except maybe during poker and golf , his only exceptions . And , more than that , whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth . I decided I would try this for a month . This was the worst month of my life . ( Laughter ) I do not recommend this at all . To give you a sense of the experience , the article was called , "" I Think You 're Fat . "" ( Laughter ) So , that was hard . My most recent book -- my previous book was called "" The Know-it-All , "" and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world , or more precisely from A-ak , which is a type of East Asian music , all the way to Zwyiec , which is -- well , I do n't want to ruin the ending . ( Laughter ) It 's a very exciting twist ending , like an O. Henry novel , so I wo n ' t ruin it . But I love that one because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb , although , listening to Kevin Kelly , you do n't have to remember anything . You can just Google it . So I wasted some time there . I love those experiments , but I think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that I 've done is my most recent experiment , where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible -- "" The Year of Living Biblically . "" And I undertook this for two reasons . The first was that I grew up with no religion at all . As I say in my book , I 'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian . ( Laughter ) So , not very . But I 've become increasingly interested in religion . I do think it 's the defining issue of our time , or one of the main ones . And I have a son . I want to know what to teach him . So , I decided to dive in head first , and try to live the Bible . The second reason I undertook this is because I 'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism , religious fundamentalism , and people who say they take the Bible literally , which is , according to some polls , as high as 45 or 50 percent of America . So I decided , what if you really did take the Bible literally ? I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally , without picking and choosing . The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles . I had Christian bibles . I had Jewish bibles . A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible , where the 23rd Psalm is rendered as , "" The Lord is all that , "" as opposed to what I knew it as , "" The Lord is my shepherd . "" Then I went down and I read several versions , and I wrote down every single law that I could find . And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules . And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of -- The Ten Commandments , love your neighbor , be fruitful and multiply . So I wanted to follow those . And actually I take my projects very seriously because I had twins during my year , so I definitely take my projects seriously . But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible . There is the law in Leviticus -- "" You can not shave the corners of your beard . "" I did n't know where my corners were , so I decided to let the whole thing grow , and this is what I looked like by the end . As you can imagine , I spent a lot of time at airport security . ( Laughter ) My wife would n ' t kiss me for the last two months . So , certainly the challenge was there . The Bible says you can not wear clothes made of mixed fibers , so I thought , "" Sounds strange , but I 'll try it . "" You only know if you try it . I got rid of all my poly-cotton t-shirts . The Bible says that if two men are in a fight , and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man , then her hand shall be cut off . So , I wanted to follow that rule . ( Laughter ) That one I followed by default , by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby , looking like she had a strong grip . ( Laughter ) So -- oh , there 's another shot of my beard . I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life-changing , and incredibly challenging . And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging . The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day . You know , I could spend a year not killing , but spending a year not gossiping , not coveting , not lying -- you know , I live in New York , and I work as a journalist , so this was 75 , 80 percent of my day I had to do it . But it was really interesting , because I was able to make some progress because I could n ' t believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts . This was one of the huge lessons of the year , is that I almost pretended to be a better person , and I became a little bit of a better person . So I had always thought , you know , "" You change your mind , and you change your behavior , "" but it 's often the other way round . You change your behavior , and you change your mind . So , you know , if you want to become more compassionate , you visit sick people in the hospital , and you will become more compassionate . You donate money to a cause , and you become emotionally involved in that cause . So , it really was cognitive psychology -- you know , cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing . The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology , very primitive cognitive psychology . In the Proverbs , it says that if you smile , you will become happier , which , as we know , is actually true . The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in 21st-century America . And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers . ( Laughter ) But it 's a big part of the Bible , so I figured I had to address it . So , I was able to stone one adulterer . It happened -- I was in the park , and I was dressed in my biblical clothing -- sandals and a white robe -- you know , because again , the outer affects the inner . I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind . And this man came up to me and he said , "" Why are you dressed like that ? "" And I explained my project , and he said , "" Well , I am an adulterer , are you going to stone me ? "" And I said , "" Well , that would be great ! "" ( Laughter ) And I took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks , hoping for just this interaction -- and , you know , they were pebbles -- but he grabbed them out of my hand . He was actually an elderly man , mid-seventies , just so you know . But he 's still an adulterer , and still quite angry . He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face , and I felt that I could -- eye for an eye , I could retaliate , and throw one back at him . So that was my experience stoning , and it did allow me to talk about in a more serious way these big issues . How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places , and yet so incredibly wise in others ? How should we view the Bible ? Should we view it , you know , as original intent , like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible ? How was the Bible written ? And actually , since this is a tech crowd , I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of Wikipedia because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years . And it 's sort of evolved . It 's not a book that was written and came down from on high . So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-away , the bigger lessons that I learned from my year . The first is -- Thou shalt not take the Bible literally . This became very , very clear , early on . Because if you do , then you end up acting like a crazy person , and stoning adulterers , or -- here 's another example -- well , that 's another -- I did spend some time shepherding . ( Laughter ) It 's a very relaxing vocation . I recommend it . But this one is , the Bible says that you can not touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you can not sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat . And my wife thought this was very offensive , so she sat in every seat in our apartment , and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around . So , you know , I met with creationists . I went to the creationists' museum . And these are the ultimate literalists . And it was fascinating , because they were not stupid people at all . I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist . It 's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model . And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this . And I will say , though , the museum is gorgeous . They really did a fantastic job . If you 're ever in Kentucky , there 's -- you can see a movie of the flood , and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes . So , whatever you think of creationism , and I think it 's crazy , they did a great job . ( Laughter ) Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks . And this one was a big lesson because I was praying , giving these prayers of thanksgiving , which was odd for an agnostic . But I was saying thanks all the time , every day , and I started to change my perspective , and I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day , that I did n't even notice , that I took for granted -- as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong . So , this is actually a key to happiness for me , is to just remember when I came over here , the car did n't flip over , and I did n't trip coming up the stairs . It 's a remarkable thing . Third , that thou shall have reverence . This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic , and by the end of the year I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic , which I love . And I 'm trying to start it as a movement . So if anyone wants to join , the basic idea is , whether or not there is a God , there 's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness , and that our rituals can be sacred . The Sabbath can be sacred . This was one of the great things about my year , doing the Sabbath , because I am a workaholic , so having this one day where you can not work -- it really , that changed my life . So , this idea of sacredness , whether or not there is a God . Thou shall not stereotype . This one happened because I spend a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey . I wanted it to be about religion in America . So I spent time with evangelical Christians , and Hasidic Jews and the Amish . I 'm very proud because I think I 'm the only person in America to out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness . ( Laughter ) After three and a half hours , he looked at his watch , he 's like , "" I gotta go . "" ( Laughter ) Oh , thank you very much . Thank you . Bless you , bless you . But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about , for instance , evangelical Christianity , and I found that it 's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it . There 's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians , and they focus on the red words in the Bible , which are the ones that Jesus spoke -- that 's how they printed them in the old bibles . And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality . They have a pamphlet that says , "" Here 's what Jesus said about homosexuality , "" and you open it up , and there 's nothing in it . So , they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts , helping poor people . So this was very inspiring to me . I recommend Jim Wallace and Tony Campolo . They 're very inspiring leaders , even though I disagree with much of what they say . Also , thou shalt not disregard the irrational . This one was very unexpected because , you know , I grew up with the scientific worldview , and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces . And the thing is , if they 're not harmful , they 're not to be completely dismissed . Because I learned that -- I was thinking , I was doing all these rituals , these biblical rituals , separating my wool and linen , and I would ask these religious people "" Why would The Bible possibly tell us to do this ? Why would God care ? "" And they said , "" We do n't know , but it 's just rituals that give us meaning . "" And I would say , "" But that 's crazy . "" And they would say , "" Well , what about you ? You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake . If a guy from Mars came down and saw , here 's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics , would the Martians say , ' Well , that guy , he makes sense , but that guy 's crazy ? ' "" So no , I think that rituals are , by nature , irrational . So the key is to choose the right rituals , the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed . And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose . And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible . And I failed miserably . Because you ca n ' t . You have to pick and choose , and anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing . The key is to pick and choose the right parts . There 's the phrase called cafeteria religion , and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way , and they 'll say , "" Oh , it 's just cafeteria religion . You 're just picking and choosing . "" But my argument is , "" What 's wrong with cafeterias ? "" I 've had some great meals at cafeterias . I 've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave . So , it 's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion , about tolerance , about loving your neighbor , as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin , or intolerance , or violence , which are very much in the Bible as well . So if we are to find any meaning in this book , then we have to really engage it , and wrestle with it . And I thought I 'd end with just a couple more . There 's me reading the Bible . That 's how I hailed taxi-cabs . ( Laughter ) Seriously , and it worked -- and yes , that was actually a rented sheep , so I had to return that in the morning , but it served well for a day . So , anyway , thank you so much for letting me speak . </content"	1
1437	"RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT & RESULTS from Extensive Studies by GolfScape Artificial Turf Manufacturers FACTS & FOES of Nylon vs. Artificial Grass Deep Infill "" Artificial Grass Deep Infill "" Systems vs. Nylon Synthetic putting greens are manufactured with several different materials . Two of the most common materials are polypropylene and nylon . A green made with nylon typically does not take an infill product , whereas a polypropylene green does . It is this artificial grass deep infill process that determines whether you birdie or bogey your game because of the advantage way that a surface , with artificial grass deep infill , reacts to your golf ball while putting and chipping onto the green . Non-filled synthetic putting greens obviously do not require infill . These greens are typically made of the nylon fiber . Nylon is what you see on miniature golf courses . Disadvantages of Nylon Problems with nylon synthetic putting greens : Nylon , a more porous fiber , will absorb water , retain odors , and lead to mold , mildew and fungus growth . Because a nylon green does not normally take an infill material , the fibers will "" mat down "" in a given time . When this happens the ball roll becomes very fast and there 's nothing that can be done to remedy the problem . In an attempt to resolve this issue , some companies will add infill to the turf , but because nylon is not designed to take an infill product , it just wo n't work . Many companies claim nylon fiber is "" heat set "" with "" memory "" and will not mat down . It simply makes sense that if there is nothing to support the fibers upright , they will mat down over time . Also , read the "" fine print "" of these companies' warranties on their nylon greens - "" normal matting or compression of fiber or compression of rubber and foam backing or padding is expressly excluded from the warranty "" . Draw you own conclusion from such contradicting statements . Nylon is a stiffer , more rigid fiber . A rigid fiber can also make the ball "" bounce "" or "" hop "" and not hold the green well . Furthermore , it has to be virtually flat for a nylon green to hold a golf ball . Although nylon greens should be built over a concrete slab , you might as well just take your penalty stroke and start over . Concrete will always crack or will always need joint for contraction and expansion . Joints and cracks will eventually agitate the green's surface creating visible ridges . Vice-versa , nylon turf with urethane backing will actually "" crawl "" across the surface creating wrinkles . A latex backing wo n't do this , but it will retain water and odors and lead to mold , mildew and fungus growth . For sure Stimp speed is not adjustable and undulations are almost nonexistent for a green built on a concrete slab . A concrete slab must have a slope for water drainage . The slope has to funnel water somewhere , which usually means towards the putting holes or all to one side of the green , resulting in puddles of stagnant water ; again leading to rot , mold and growth of fungus . If the nylon turf has a latex or rubber backing or padding , the problem is compounded . Rubber padding will compact and break down , forming irregular dips in the green , similar to what happens to an old worn out couch cushion . Stagnant water can accumulate under those too . Add that to the matted down fibers and you 've scored a "" double-bogey "" of a problem . Nylon fibers tend to be darker . A darker color gives the surface an unnatural blue-green appearance . Do n't take our word for it . Go to the internet and look at the photo galleries of companies selling nylon greens . You will notice greens that are abnormally dark or greens that actually look blue-green . Putting greens should "" accentuate , enhance and blend "" into the surrounding landscape , not detract from it . Nylon has streak lines caused either by inconsistencies of the dye lot or during the shearing process , which runs the length of the turf and can seriously hamper true ball roll . Final Note : Nylon greens cost almost twice as much as polypropylene . But because of the problems associated with nylon greens , you 're getting half of the product for twice the price . All of these problems combined are sure to handicap your short game . After extensive research of the fiber and manufacturing process , we have determined that the technology for nylon putting greens has yet to produce a putting surface that consistently provides true ball roll and holding characteristics of a real grass green . Polypropylene greens are the most realistic looking and have the most consistent surfaces . Its durable fiber can withstand all inclement weather conditions that Mother Nature can hurl at it . This increases the longevity of the green's life . They provide many more options for designing undulations , especially when built over a crushed sub-base . The fibers of an artificial grass deep infilled green are pre-bent and will not mat down over time They are maintenance free - : blow debris off with a leaf blower . Polypropylene greens have proven performance . Some companies claim that the taller the turf , the better the ball roll . They use a 1-1 / 2 turf , which requires much more infill product . More infill means that the fibers will be further apart . More distance between the fibers means the ball can roll on between fibers and infill , which is not a true and consistent ball roll . Usually a 1-1 / 2 fiber is used for the installations of synthetic football and soccer fields . These companies will try to adapt that fiber to a putting green surface , which signals the beginning to a multitude of frustrating problems . Some of these companies claim to be the manufacturer of their products . Buyer beware ! Most companies are simply the "" middlemen "" who sell products that they never actually see for themselves or who will sell factory "" seconds "" . A product may be classified as a second if there is color difference in the yarn used , a flaw or streak in the length of the material , or the backing is defective . Their "" manufactured "" products are not fully inspected for quality . Facts About Nylon Nylon golf greens offer the worst of all possible combinations . They are sold by "" sales people "" , not textile experts . At one time Dupont's nylon 6.6 dominated the sport field market place but was never intended for golf course applications . Except for commercial driving range golf mats , new fiber and infill technologies have virtually eliminated nylon from the sports turf and golf green scene . American Sports & Recreational Surfaces manufactures range mats with SFI monofilament nylon ( SFI is the available source for monofilament nylon in the United States ) . Golf greens using this nylon have "" streak "" lines . If you absolutely have to purchase a nylon golf green demand "" in writing "" that the turf will not have "" streaked "" lines in it . Nylon should be installed over concrete , not nailed down over sand or crushed stone . Nylon with a urethane secondary backing will expand and contract as the ambient temperature changes . This will cause the turf to "" crawl "" on top of the sub-base . Using spikes to hold down the perimeter edges will create bubbles and wrinkles in the turf . You are probably not installing the green for "" goofy golf "" but that is exactly what you will get when the turf bubbles , wrinkles or covers half the cup due to shifting . This is why outdoor nylon turf installations have always been a total direct glue down onto concrete , asphalt . E-Layer or other stabilized substrate . Nylon Golf Greens Will Not Hold A Shot Some companies are still selling nylon turf with an attached expanded urethane foam cushion for outdoor golf greens . These cushions are open cell products that absorb water , retain odors and have a fatigue factor . This will accept short chip shots until your golf green rots or your wife demands it 's removal . If you topdress this nylon turf with the sand these same sales people recommend you will have a nice hard surface to park your boat on . Nylon turf golf greens seem attractive because they are quick to install but the fact is that nylon should be limited to indoor installations where entertainment is the primary objective , rather than a tool to improve your golf game and your home value , if "" streaks "" are not a concern ."	2
1385	"If a cracker is trying to break into the account by trying to guess the password , a changed password makes it difficult for the attacker . If an account has already been breached , the password expiration will help prevent or at least raise suspicions that there is an issue . With a good enterprise password management tool , such as Avatier's Password Station , the real user will get notifications about needing to change their password before it is expired which the cracker may never see . Finally , if the account has been breached and the cracker changes the password , the user may notice they ca n't get into their account anymore and this may lead to an investigation . Those are all good and valuable benefits . However , on the other side are a few major problems : Many users will start using passwords like "" howdy1 "" . Then , when the expiration hits , they just change it to "" howdy2 "" . This means that if the password is ever cracked , it is likely the cracker will be able to guess future passwords as well . Other users will start writing down their passwords because they ca n't remember them anymore . The shorter the password expiration , the greater the number of Help Desk calls related to forgotten passwords will be . So what can be done to get the benefits of an enterprise password manager while minimizing the problems ? First , the number of different passwords in the organization needs to be considered . A company with one Windows domain is going to have fewer issues than a company with a mix of Windows , ERP , Databases , Unix , Mainframe , and so on . When multiple systems are in play , the first thing to do is to implement a password synchronization product , such as Password Station . This will enable users to only need to remember one password for all the systems instead of several passwords . This increases the likelihood of a good password being chosen and remembered . Second , password history can be used to prevent a user from reusing the same few passwords over and over again . Some systems can enforce this natively , but having your password synchronization software handle this capability will ensure all systems are in scope . The appropriate strength of the enterprise password management software policy is also critical to success . A product like Password Bouncer allows admins to utilize an automated password reset tool to enforce policies that prevents users from setting very simple passwords that are easy to crack yet simple enough that users will not have to write them down to be remembered . Finally , the time frame of the password expiration needs to be considered . Obviously , a password policy that is daily or weekly is going to lead to problems . At the other extreme , a policy that only enforces changes yearly is probably not strong enough . A reasonable time frame of password expiration is anywhere from 1 to 6 months depending on the compliance and cyber security threats to an organization . The complexity of the enterprise password management software policy needs to be factored in . If the policy is complex , the password expiration could be longer . If the policy is very simple , then the expiration should be shorter ."	2

Nicky Buss , UK client services director of WPP customer marketing giant Research International , has been linked to the role . She was global strategic planning director of WPP's Red Cell Network . The National Heart Forum , an alliance of health , medical and consumer organisations , yesterday ( Monday ) said it was preparing an application for a judicial review against the broadcast regulator , Ofcom , claiming its crackdown on junk food advertising does not go far enough . The heart charity alleges that it is unlawful and unfair of the regulator to exclude bringing in a 9pm watershed for junk food advertising in its ongoing consultation from "" full and fair consideration "" . NatMags has appointed Niall Hogan , former sales director at Emap Interactive , as its first digital ad director . Hogan joins ahead of the launch of websites for Country Living , Cosmopolitan and Good Housekeeping and six category-branded websites . The Independent's sales for the 16 May issue , guest edited by Bono , were up by more than 30 % , producing its best sale since 9 / 11 , according to editor-in-chief Simon Kelner . The paper has also partnered with Renault and Rough Guide travelbooks to produce a guide to Mediterranean festivals , which it will give away on Saturday . Spending on digital and direct media rose by 22 % year on year in the first three months of 2006 , with the two media now accounting for a quarter of all ad media spend , a study by KPMG and Thomson Intermedia claims . Though traditional media spend fell year on year for the first time in three years , overall ad spend was up 3.2 % . Benchmark Capital , the venture capitalist behind Irish pay-TV group Setanta , eBay , Betfair and MySQL , has invested £ 8m in social networking site Bebo . c om .

The campaign , which breaks on 29 May , will run in magazines including Grazia , OK ! and Glamour as well as supermarket titles and websites ."	8
176	"Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify the overwhelming complexity and richness that we experience at the conference in a project called Big Viz . And the Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches that were made by two visual artists . David Sibbet from The Grove , and Kevin Richards from Autodesk made 650 sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter's ideas . And the consensus was , it really worked . These sketches brought to life the key ideas , the portraits , the magic moments that we all experienced last year . This year we were thinking , "" Why does it work ? "" What is it about animation , graphics , illustrations , that create meaning ? And this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning , the better we can communicate , and I also think , the better we can think and collaborate together . So this year we 're going to visualize how the brain visualizes . Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain does n ' t actually see the world as it is , but instead , creates a series of mental models through a collection of "" Ah-ha moments , "" or moments of discovery , through various processes . The processing , of course , begins with the eyes . Light enters , hits the back of the retina , and is circulated , most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain , at the primary visual cortex . And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry , just the simplest of shapes . But it also acts like a kind of relay station that re-radiates and redirects information to many other parts of the brain . As many as 30 other parts that selectively make more sense , create more meaning through the kind of "" Ah-ha "" experiences . We 're only going to talk about three of them . So the first one is called the ventral stream . It 's on this side of the brain . And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is . It 's the "" what "" detector . Look at a hand . Look at a remote control . Chair . Book . So that 's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something . A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream . And what it does is locates the object in physical body space . So if you look around the stage here you 'll create a kind of mental map of the stage . And if you closed your eyes you 'd be able to mentally navigate it . You 'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that . The third part that I 'd like to talk about is the limbic system . And this is deep inside of the brain . It 's very old , evolutionarily . And it 's the part that feels . It 's the kind of gut center , where you see an image and you go , "" Oh ! I have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever I 'm seeing . "" So the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways . So what can we learn about this ? How can we apply this insight ? Well , again , the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at . The brain processes this in parallel , the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create a unified mental model . So , for example , when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around , to selectively create a visual logic . So the act of engaging , and looking at the image creates the meaning . It 's the selective logic . Now we 've augmented this and spatialized this information . Many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with Perceptive Pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall . And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas . So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning . It activates a different part of the brain . And then the limbic system is activated when we see motion , when we see color . and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors that we 've heard about before . So the point of this is what ? We make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual interrogation . The lessons for us are three-fold . First , use images to clarify what we 're trying to communicate . Secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully . And the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence . These are techniques that can be used to be -- that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving . So the low-tech version looks like this . And , by the way , this is the way in which we develop and formulate strategy within Autodesk , in some of our organizations and some of our divisions . What we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall . And it 's very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else . There 's always a room , always a place to be able to make sense of all of the components in the strategic plan . This is a time-lapse view of it . You can ask the question , "" Who 's the boss ? "" You 'll be able to figure that out . So the act of collectively and collaboratively building the image transforms the collaboration . No Powerpoint is used in two days . But instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on . And this can be enhanced and augmented with some emerging digital technology . And this is our great unveiling for today . And this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible . Here what we can do is look at sustainability , quite literally . So a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen . So making images meaningful has three components . The first again , is making ideas clear by visualizing them . Secondly , making them interactive . And then thirdly , making them persistent . And I believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today . Thanks so much . ( Applause ) </content"	0

91	"Budapest Open Access Initiative An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an unprecedented public good . The old tradition is the willingness of scientists and scholars to publish the fruits of their research in scholarly journals without payment , for the sake of inquiry and knowledge . The new technology is the internet . The public good they make possible is the world-wide electronic distribution of the peer-reviewed journal literature and completely free and unrestricted access to it by all scientists , scholars , teachers , students , and other curious minds . Removing access barriers to this literature will accelerate research , enrich education , share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich , make this literature as useful as it can be , and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge . For various reasons , this kind of free and unrestricted online availability , which we will call open access , has so far been limited to small portions of the journal literature . But even in these limited collections , many different initiatives have shown that open access is economically feasible , that it gives readers extraordinary power to find and make use of relevant literature , and that it gives authors and their works vast and measurable new visibility , readership , and impact . To secure these benefits for all , we call on all interested institutions and individuals to help open up access to the rest of this literature and remove the barriers , especially the price barriers , that stand in the way . The more who join the effort to advance this cause , the sooner we will all enjoy the benefits of open access . The literature that should be freely accessible online is that which scholars give to the world without expectation of payment . Primarily , this category encompasses their peer-reviewed journal articles , but it also includes any unreviewed preprints that they might wish to put online for comment or to alert colleagues to important research findings . There are many degrees and kinds of wider and easier access to this literature . By "" open access "" to this literature , we mean its free availability on the public internet , permitting any users to read , download , copy , distribute , print , search , or link to the full texts of these articles , crawl them for indexing , pass them as data to software , or use them for any other lawful purpose , without financial , legal , or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself . The only constraint on reproduction and distribution , and the only role for copyright in this domain , should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited . While the peer-reviewed journal literature should be accessible online without cost to readers , it is not costless to produce . However , experiments show that the overall costs of providing open access to this literature are far lower than the costs of traditional forms of dissemination . With such an opportunity to save money and expand the scope of dissemination at the same time , there is today a strong incentive for professional associations , universities , libraries , foundations , and others to embrace open access as a means of advancing their missions . Achieving open access will require new cost recovery models and financing mechanisms , but the significantly lower overall cost of dissemination is a reason to be confident that the goal is attainable and not merely preferable or utopian . To achieve open access to scholarly journal literature , we recommend two complementary strategies . I. Self-Archiving : First , scholars need the tools and assistance to deposit their refereed journal articles in open electronic archives , a practice commonly called , self-archiving . When these archives conform to standards created by the Open Archives Initiative , then search engines and other tools can treat the separate archives as one . Users then need not know which archives exist or where they are located in order to find and make use of their contents . II . Open-access Journals : Second , scholars need the means to launch a new generation of journals committed to open access , and to help existing journals that elect to make the transition to open access . Because journal articles should be disseminated as widely as possible , these new journals will no longer invoke copyright to restrict access to and use of the material they publish . Instead they will use copyright and other tools to ensure permanent open access to all the articles they publish . Because price is a barrier to access , these new journals will not charge subscription or access fees , and will turn to other methods for covering their expenses . There are many alternative sources of funds for this purpose , including the foundations and governments that fund research , the universities and laboratories that employ researchers , endowments set up by discipline or institution , friends of the cause of open access , profits from the sale of add-ons to the basic texts , funds freed up by the demise or cancellation of journals charging traditional subscription or access fees , or even contributions from the researchers themselves . There is no need to favor one of these solutions over the others for all disciplines or nations , and no need to stop looking for other , creative alternatives . Open access to peer-reviewed journal literature is the goal . Self-archiving ( I. ) and a new generation of open-access journals ( II . ) are the ways to attain this goal . They are not only direct and effective means to this end , they are within the reach of scholars themselves , immediately , and need not wait on changes brought about by markets or legislation . While we endorse the two strategies just outlined , we also encourage experimentation with further ways to make the transition from the present methods of dissemination to open access . Flexibility , experimentation , and adaptation to local circumstances are the best ways to assure that progress in diverse settings will be rapid , secure , and long-lived . The Open Society Institute , the foundation network founded by philanthropist George Soros , is committed to providing initial help and funding to realize this goal . It will use its resources and influence to extend and promote institutional self-archiving , to launch new open-access journals , and to help an open-access journal system become economically self-sustaining . While the Open Society Institute's commitment and resources are substantial , this initiative is very much in need of other organizations to lend their effort and resources . We invite governments , universities , libraries , journal editors , publishers , foundations , learned societies , professional associations , and individual scholars who share our vision to join us in the task of removing the barriers to open access and building a future in which research and education in every part of the world are that much more free to flourish .

"" This was , it transpires , the beginning of an anti-Cuban campaign or an act of vengeance for the extraordinary debacle of the fascist coup which he had orchestrated , or both . When challenged publicly by the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday , 7 May , the State Department said that it had no firm information , and did not wish to discuss the matter any further . The idea of destroying Cuba , an obsession which has lasted more than 43 years , has led and continues to lead United States policy down a tortuous path of lies , fiascos and blunders . The discrepancy between what the United States Government is telling the world today and what it is actually doing with Cuba represents the most egregious and demoralizing contradiction of its foreign policy . Never before has this super-Power found itself in such a compromising situation , which has left it no choice but to lie , lie and lie again . There is no shortage of unscrupulous characters in high public office prepared to do this , or of press spokesmen painfully contorting themselves to disavow the wrongdoings of their superiors and to explain the inexplicable in their statements . Even a man like Colin Powell , the son of Jamaican immigrants , who , notwithstanding his military training - or perhaps because of it - is not considered to be a warmonger since he knows war and has seen men die , a man whom many Americans have come to look on as a potential presidential candidate , has found himself embroiled by these characters in squalid machinations that do him little credit . He better than anyone else knows how inexperienced they are and can see what little political and intellectual worth they have . As for this new character who has entered the scene with his sinister manoeuvres against Cuba , whom is he hoping to deceive ? We refer to John Bolton , Under-Secretary of State , responsible for nothing less than arms control . What exactly is this official hoping to achieve with his inflammatory and aggressive speech against Cuba given at the Heritage Foundation , well known for its ultra-right stance ? These statements , purportedly an analysis of the dangers of terrorism threatening the United States , began by saying : "" In addition to Libya and Syria , there is a threat coming from another signatory to the Biological Weapons Convention , and one that lies just 90 miles from the United States mainland - namely , Cuba . "" Then , after the usual name-calling and absurd allegations filled with loathing that are so typical of arrogant and uninformed people , Mr Bolton added , this time off his own bat : "" We know that Cuba is collaborating with other State sponsors of terror . "" Castro has repeatedly denounced the United States' war on terrorism . He continues to view terror as a legitimate tactic to further revolutionary objectives . Last year , Castro visited Iran , Syria and Libya - all designees on the same list of terrorist-sponsoring States . At Tehran University , these were his words : ' Iran and Cuba , in cooperation with each other , can bring America to its knees . The United States regime is very weak , and we are witnessing this weakness from close up . ' "" But Cuba's threat to our security often has been underplayed . An official United States Government report in 1999 concluded that Cuba did not represent a significant military threat to the United States or the region . It went only so far as to say that ' Cuba has a limited capacity to engage in some military and intelligence activities which could pose a danger to United States citizens under some circumstances . ' "" Mr. Bolton then immediately started casting about for some explanation for the suspicious fact that no United States Government official had ever before thought to level such a deplorable accusation against Cuba . Bolton blames this weakness on William Cohen , who was United States Defence Secretary four years earlier when the much criticized report was issued . Bolton omitted to mention the fact that , a mere five months and two weeks before , on 19 November 2001 , he himself had not made the slightest reference to Cuba in his address to the Fifth Review Conference of the Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention in Geneva , when he cited many countries that were of concern to him as potential producers of biological weapons . So why this sudden and unexpected change ? Mr. Bolton's scurrilous remarks of 6 May conclude with the allegation : "" For four decades Cuba has maintained a well developed and sophisticated biomedical industry , supported until 1990 by the Soviet Union . This industry is one of the most advanced in Latin America and leads in the production of pharmaceuticals and vaccines that are sold worldwide . Analysts and Cuban defectors have long cast suspicion on the activities conducted in these biomedical facilities . "" Here is what we now know : The United States believes that Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research-and-development effort . Cuba has provided dual-use biotechnology to other rogue States . We are concerned that such technology could support biological weapons programmes in those States . We call on Cuba to cease all biological weapons-applicable cooperation with rogue States and to comply fully with all of its obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention . "" Just as he had hoped , Mr. Bolton's string of barefaced lies was immediately picked up by the international press . "" Washington , 6 May ( ANSA ) . Under-Secretary of State John Bolton today accused Cuba of helping ' enemy Governments ' with biological weapons programmes . "" ' Cuba has at least an offensive biological weapons programme and could be transferring its results to other States hostile to the United States ' , said Bolton . "" Under-Secretary Bolton was speaking to the Heritage Foundation , one of the ultra-conservative groups in Washington . "" "" Washington , 6 May ( DPA ) . The United States today accused Cuba of developing offensive biological weapons and of providing information about these weapons to States hostile to the United States , and urged President Fidel Castro's Government to cease this cooperation . "" "" Washington , 6 May ( Reuters ) . On Monday , the United States accused three countries - Cuba , Libya and Syria - of trying to develop weapons of mass destruction and warned that it would take steps to prevent them from providing these arms to terrorist groups . "" ' States that sponsor terrorism and seek to obtain weapons of mass destruction must cease these activities ' , he said . ' States that renounce terror and abandon weapons of mass destruction can become part of our effort . But those which do not can expect to become our targets . ' "" "" Washington , 6 May ( EFE ) . The United States today added Cuba , Libya and Syria to the list of countries which form the ' axis of evil ' intent on manufacturing weapons of mass destruction , and warned that it would take steps to prevent them from supplying such weapons to terrorist organizations . "" "" Washington , 6 May ( Notimex ) . The United States today included Cuba on the so-called ' axis of evil ' , because it believed that it has the capacity to develop biological weapons which would pose a threat to its security , greater than that posed by Iraq , Iran and North Korea . "" "" Washington , 6 May ( AFP ) . On Monday , the United States warned Cuba against any proliferation of biological weapons , urging the island's Government to cease any supplies of biotechnological equipment to countries that Washington considers potentially dangerous , such as Iraq and Libya . "" The list of such articles and reports on this issue could be continued indefinitely . So , the deed has already been done ! The whole world , and in particular the American public , which is constantly bombarded with shameless lies , has been fed the necessary information and is now ready to believe that Cuba is a biological power , that it has a programme for the production of such weapons and that it poses a danger to the United States . And , as this has been stated by Mr. John Bolton , the very distinguished Under-Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security , we have to believe it . Tired old tricks and stupid arguments As the old saying goes , it is easier to catch a liar than a lame man . Some people in the United States itself find all this simply too hard to believe and are beginning to read between the lines . "" Washington , 7 May ( Notimex ) . The United States today refused to produce the evidence it claimed to have to back up accusations it had made against Cuba to the effect that the island had a limited capacity to develop chemical and biological weapons . "" The spokesmen of both the White House and the State Department maintained that the accusation against Cuba was not based on assumptions but on confidential information about the biological and chemical potential of the Cuban pharmaceutical industry . "" This accusation came as a surprise not only to the international community , but even to members of the United States Congress . According to the same dispatch , "" Political analysts pointed out that the accusation against Cuba by the Bush administration could form part of a White House strategy to justify moves to tighten its isolationist policy on Cuba . "" The statement that Cuba could pose a terrorist threat to United States security was made at a time when several proposals to relax Washington's Cuba policy were being studied on Capitol Hill . "" Political analysts believe , however , that , given this possibility , and bearing in mind that his brother Jeb will be seeking re-election as Governor of Florida this year , President Bush is hoping to ingratiate himself with the Cuban exile community . "" Given that more than four decades of economic blockade against Cuba have not succeeded in removing Fidel Castro from power in Havana , the only people who want this isolationist policy to remain in effect and to be tightened are the great majority of the Cuban exile community in the United States . "" The possibility of including Cuba as a member of the so-called ' axis of evil ' , with Iraq , Iran and North Korea at its head , would make it easier for Bush to obtain Congress backing for moves to increase - rather than decrease - the economic stranglehold which it has on the island . "" "" Washington , 7 May ( AP ) . ' I think that it will hold up the adoption of any new steps towards an opening up of trade , ' said Bob Graham , chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence . ' Unilateral steps will be most affected . ' "" Graham did not hide his amazement at Bolton's accusation , however . He said that , in March , the Committee he chairs had held a secret hearing on security-related issues and that the administration had made no mention of biological weapons . "" On 7 May , when a journalist asked White House spokesman Ari Fleischer : "" Is there any proof of this or is this an assumption by the United States ? "" Fleischer replied : "" No , it 's not an assumption . I assure you that Secretary Bolton would not have said it if he did not have good cause , reasons and facts to base it on . It was based on sound analysis and on information available to the United States Government , which it has studied . "" This is a typical reply by someone who has no grounds or substance for what he says . The only things being carefully studied are falsehoods and deceitful ploys . One pities this spokesman for the job he has to do . Besides , why should we believe Mr. Bolton anyway ? Anyone who remembers the 15 incredible pretexts , which have come to light today in declassified official documents , that were devised at the end of 1961 by the powers that be in the United States with the aim of launching a direct military attack against Cuba in 1962 , would find nothing surprising in this sinister fabrication . But we demand proof . Let them produce even the smallest shred of evidence ! They do not have any and they can not have any since there is not and can not be any such evidence . As there is not so much as an atom of truth in what they say , they should not now try and hide behind the alleged sensitivity of their sources . This is a worn out old trick and an extremely stupid argument , which only serves to show in what very low esteem they hold the American public , whose intelligence deserves greater respect . I will also say this : If Cuban scientists from any of our biotechnology institutes had been cooperating with any country in the development of biological weapons , or had tried to create such weapons on their own initiative they would immediately be hauled before a court of justice on a charge of treason . The Acts of Terrorism Act passed by the National Assembly of Cuba stipulates , in its article 10 : "" Anyone who manufactures , facilitates , sells , transports , transfers , introduces into the country or keeps in his or her possession , under any form or in any place [ ... ] chemical or biological agents , or any other substance from which any product that fits this description can be derived through research , design or a combination thereof "" shall be liable to penalties of between 10 and 30 years privation of liberty , life imprisonment or death . This is , without question , a total fabrication , a treacherous blow against the sale of food to Cuba authorized by a law passed in 2000 , which has subsequently undergone countless modifications and amendments , introduced by those bitterly opposed to any lifting of the blockade , rendering it virtually unworkable , even when - despite everything - it was finally passed . Efforts are also being made to mislead and discourage the growing number of Americans who are increasingly repelled by the cruel and inhuman measures taken against the Cuban people , which fly in the face of the idealism and ethics of a nation which , for years and years , has been fed nothing but lies about Cuba . The only truth in Bolton's falsehoods was the geographical fact that Cuba lies 90 miles from the continental territory of the United States . Slanderous invention , born of falsehood and deception It is false and a total distortion to assert that our country has repeatedly denounced the United States' war against terrorism . I have said , and I stand by it , that the solution to this scourge will not be attained through war , which will serve only to breed hatred and fanaticism , but through sincere and determined cooperation among all countries in the world and by building a truly universal culture and mindset against terrorism . We were the first to suggest this form of cooperation , the very day of the tragedy in New York . It was a slanderous invention , born of falsehood and deception , to assert that Castro considers terrorism a legitimate tactic for furthering revolutionary objectives , since , as everyone knows , our revolutionary movement never practised any methods which were not consistent with our doctrine , our principles and our perception of armed struggle . You should get your facts straight , Mr. Bolton , and you should not be misled by the fictions narrated by your good friends in the Foundation . The civilian population and innocent people have never been the victims of our actions . Our tactic was always to fight against fully equipped enemy units . These days you seem to want to label as terrorism any armed resistance , regardless of the legitimate causes that may justify it . Applying this logic , you would be quite capable of describing as terrorism the struggle of the American colonists who rebelled and fought against English domination . George Washington and those who , after long years of war and enormous sacrifices , finally secured the independence of the United States were not terrorists . Your people led you astray , Mr. Bolton , when they told you about my address at the University of Tehran . It was not one address , but two , in two universities , and a few remarks which I made at the end of my visit to the mausoleum in which the body of the late Imam Khomeini lies . I have gone over them all in detail . In my address to the students in Tehran , there does not seem to be a single paragraph resembling that mendaciously cited in your statement on 6 May to the Heritage Foundation . At no point did I say that "" Iran and Cuba , in cooperation with each other , can bring America to its knees "" . I did say , in one of the three statements I made during the visit , that imperialism was bereft of ideas , that ideas were more powerful than weapons and that one day imperialism would collapse . I also said that the Shah "" was overthrown by the Iranian people through their heroism , and without weapons , which demonstrated the power of ideas and showed that there could never be any person in the world so powerful that he could not be brought down by ideas . This is our hope "" . And , at the end , I added : "" there is one super-Power which has thousands of nuclear weapons , aircraft , battleships , aircraft carriers , smart missiles [ ... ] . However many weapons it may possess and however great its wealth , it will never be able to defeat the human spirit "" . I did not make the slightest allusion to the use of weapons in this struggle . Indeed , I said just the opposite . That is what I think , that is how I saw it then and that is what I said . I am not in the habit of hiding my thoughts or twisting my words . My three statements in the Iranian capital were broadcast on Cuban radio and television . Thus , Mr. Bolton did not uncover anything , nor do I renounce any of my ideas . I said some other things about political beliefs and principles . I have all the tapes and the transcripts of those statements and I can prove what I said . I should also point out that , when I visited Iran , I had the honour of discovering a country with a culture thousands of years old , with deep religious convictions and great spiritual strength ; a country anxious to eradicate poverty , to fight against drug trafficking and other such plagues , a country determined to bring education , health , employment and well-being to more than 65 million people . Not one of the many leaders with whom I talked said anything to me about biological weapons or weapons of any other kind . I was able to see what an immense difference there is between the culture and customs of that country and those of the West . Iran was not the only country I visited : I went also to Algeria , Malaysia , Qatar , Syria and , finally , Libya , where I was shown how Qadaffi's family home had been destroyed and I heard about the loss of human life - including that of a little girl - inflicted by the brutal F-16 air raid . Those parts of the world which I visited possess a wealth of history thousands of years old , which must not be destroyed and neither must their populations be annihilated . Thousands of millions of people throughout the world have watched with profound indignation the televised images of the horrendous events in Palestine . When he referred to my statement in Iran , Mr. Bolton irresponsibly and dishonestly mixed up excerpts of what I had said with bits and pieces of statements made by other people and reported by foreign press agencies and information from other sources picked up from wire-service cables or material simply concocted by himself . He made such a dog's breakfast of all this material that he himself can no longer make head or tail of it . My clear , precise and transparent statements can be found in the speeches I have mentioned and in the press communiqué of 10 May 2001 issued by both delegations , which , in paragraph 6 of the agreed document , sets out the Cuban position against terrorism , which states , and I quote : "" While condemning the phenomenon of terrorism in all its forms , especially State terrorism , the two parties agreed to cooperate closely at bilateral and international levels to fight against and eliminate this terrible phenomenon , to cooperate in efforts to combat international organized crime and drug trafficking , being always mindful of the cardinal principles of international law , and in particular those of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States . "" This statement was issued 127 days before 11 September . I must thank Mr. Bolton for the praise which he heaps on our pharmaceutical industry : "" one of the most advanced in Latin America [ , which ] leads in the production of pharmaceuticals and vaccines that are sold worldwide , "" as he said in his own words . If only it were more advanced . Even his country could benefit from some of its attainments , but they would not permit it . He lies shamelessly , however , when he tells the American public and the world at large that the United States believes that Cuba is engaged in at least a limited offensive biological warfare research-and-development effort . This statement is as false as it is serious . Our researchers and doctors are educated in such a way as to instil in them a strong sense of solidarity and ethics . Millions of people in the world can testify to this . They work for the well-being and health of humankind . Over the last 40 years , 34,307 Cuban doctors and health workers have provided their services , free of charge , in a large number of poor countries , saving lives and safeguarding the health of millions of people . No one in the world could surpass them in their dedication and willingness to make sacrifices . At this very time , 2,671 of them are working in isolated and inhospitable areas of Latin America , the Caribbean and Africa . It would be very difficult to persuade these men and women to manufacture viruses and bacteria to kill children , women , old people or the citizens of any country . The pride and high moral standards of our people , which have enabled them to withstand 43 years of attacks and blockade , rest on the sound basis of a policy which is entirely consistent with all their ethics and principles . In all , some 39,800 young people from more than 120 Third-World countries have graduated in Cuba in 33 specialized academic and technical fields . Even under the prevailing conditions during this special period , induced by the cruel economic blockade , there are 8,053 young people from Latin America , the Caribbean and Africa following medical degree courses in our country - receiving training which , in the United States , costs more than $ 200 , 000 , without paying a single cent . Despite the lying allegations of Bolton and many others of his ilk , Cuba enjoys great recognition for the health services which it has rendered to humankind . These constitute a true fight against another form of terror , which many choose to ignore : the diseases which every year kill more than 11 million children , whose lives could be saved were it not for the selfish attitude of the industrialized world . An incalculable number of people survive or recover their health thanks to the selfless efforts of doctors from a small and poor country , who treat them with vaccines and preventive methods or therapies developed by Cuba . We would like to know if the United States Government is doing something similar or if it would be prepared to cooperate in such programmes for the benefit of what it euphemistically terms the "" emerging countries "" , since we have not excluded any economically developed country from participating in these programmes . We have offered hundreds of scholarships at the Latin American School of Medical Sciences to American youngsters who lack the funds to study medicine in their own country . Cuban children are vaccinated against 13 diseases and enjoy splendid health . The infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births is lower than that of the United States . Medical care is guaranteed to 100 per cent of the population and is provided absolutely free of charge . The sorry situation in the United States , with its more than 280 million inhabitants , where 16 per cent of the population , including more than 10 million children , have no medical insurance , is quite unknown in Cuba . In such an immensely rich and scientifically advanced country , where hundreds of thousands of citizens die every year for these reasons , who is held to blame ? Who kills these people and who denounces these deplorable facts ? How can they concoct such lies ? With what moral right dare they affirm from over there that we , in Cuba , are developing biological warfare ? Who is going to believe their monstrous slanders ? On the other hand , never over the 43 years of its history since the revolution has anyone in our country launched or taken part in any terrorist act mounted from our territory against the United States . Not a single drop of United States blood has been shed , nor has any company lost so much as a simple screw as a result of any terrorist act hatched in Cuba . This can not be said about Cuba by those in the United States who accuse our country of terrorism , or of supporting or sponsoring terrorism . Thousands of our compatriots have died and tens of thousands of acts of sabotage have been recorded as part of terrorist activities and aggression mounted from the United States against Cuba . How can their spokesmen deny these glaring facts ? I am not referring here to the American public : I am referring to their Governments . Not the slightest attempt has been made to clarify the overriding question of the powers granted to United States Government officials to conduct extrajudicial executions and to kill people anywhere in the world . I myself have often been the target of their sinister plans . That was how they operated in the past . Have they or have they not now reverted to those repugnant methods ? Why does Mr. Bolton not tell us something about that instead ? Cuba's irreproachable policy on weapons of mass destruction Where weapons of mass destruction are concerned , Cuba's policies have been irreproachable . No one has ever produced a single shred of evidence that our country has embarked on a programme to develop nuclear , chemical or biological weapons . Even people who have no comprehension of the ethics , the attachment to the truth and the transparency which informs the conduct of a Government like that of Cuba will be able to understand at least that for Cuba to have acted in any other way would have been an act of immense stupidity . Any such programme would ruin the economy of a small country : Cuba would never have been able to transport such weapons and it would have been a further mistake to have used them in combat against an enemy which had thousands more such weapons and would have been only too delighted for an excuse to use them . From the political standpoint , we are living in an age that will bring weapons far more powerful than any that technology can produce : namely , the weapons of morality , reason and ideas . Without these , no country is powerful ; with them , no country is weak . To adhere to this maxim , any country needs to be extremely motivated , clear-headed and perspicacious . Let it be known that the Cuban people revere above all other things on earth the ideals that inspire freedom , dignity , love of their country , their identity and their culture , and the strictest possible adherence to justice . These are not weapons of mass destruction : they are weapons of mass moral defence and we are willing to fight and die for them . I understand that , for a man like Bolton , intoxicated with the military , economic and technological might of the super-Power on whose behalf he speaks , it might be difficult to understand these things . It would , however , be a good thing for him to try . Cuba has absolutely nothing to hide . On the contrary , it is proud of its progress in the field of biomedical research . Let us briefly review its history : 1979 : The Genetic Engineering Group was set up in the National Centre for Scientific Research ; 1981 : The first biotechnological scientific production institution designed for the manufacture of the Leukocyte Interferon was set up ; The pharmaceutical and biotechnological industry programme came into being as a result of the country's scientific , economic and social development ; The necessary standards were set in place for inspection and certification by international agencies and the regulatory bodies of those countries with which Cuba was to have trade relations ; The period between 1990 and 1997 saw the development of the bulk of the investment programme , comprising 40 separate facilities ; An exclusively humanitarian industry is being developed , dedicated to the development and manufacture of medicines designed to prevent illnesses and to save lives , as well as to food production ; Technology and equipment used everywhere in the world is being purchased from commercial companies with international standing ; Under agreements entered into by Cuba with the Biological Weapons Convention , Cuba's biotechnology , health system and civil defence sectors submit annual reports to the United Nations on confidence-building measures ; Regulatory bodies from many different countries have visited Cuban biotechnology production facilities as a prerequisite for the marketing of our products in their countries ; Over the next few years , more than 50 new products , including biopharmaceuticals , vaccines and diagnostic kits , will come onto the market ; Cuba already possesses a wealth of intellectual property , comprising more than 150 inventions and over 500 patents registered abroad . The results of Cuban scientific research are published in leading international journals ; 1990 : First exports of Cuban products , which have increased every year since ; 1992 : Cuba signed the Convention on Biological Diversity and ratified it in 1994 ; 1995 : Landmark forms of marketing are introduced : technology transfers , risk contracts for development projects with foreign companies , manufacturing and trading partnerships ; Today , products and technology of the Cuban biotechnology industry are to be found in more than 40 countries . Technology transfer agreements or negotiations have been concluded or are under way with 14 countries : India : 4 transfers , 4 products ; China : 2 transfers , 4 products ; Brazil : 2 transfers , 2 products ; Egypt : 4 transfers , 1 product under negotiation ; Malaysia : 6 transfers ; Iran : 4 transfers , 4 products ; Russia : 1 transfer , 1 product ; South Africa : 1 transfer , 1 product ; Tunisia : 1 transfer , 1 product ; Algeria : 1 transfer , 3 products ; United Kingdom - Belgium : 1 transfer , 1 product ; Venezuela : 1 transfer , 2 products under negotiation ; Mexico : 1 transfer , 1 product . New trade and production negotiations are under way with 10 countries : Malaysia , Netherlands , Spain , Brazil , Venezuela , Viet Nam , Mexico , Ukraine , Germany and the United States ( negotiations are under way with the United States on the use of the Cuban anti-meningitis vaccine and the first steps have been made towards possible clinical trials with the EGF vaccine for lung cancer ) . Cuba's biotechnology centres have already registered : 24 products , including both biopharmaceuticals and vaccines ; 49 state-of-the-art generic medicines ; 5 products for treating AIDS ; 15 new types of medical equipment ; 24 diagnostic systems . In addition to these achievements , scientists and researchers are continuing work on 60 more projects , prominent among which are the following : 29 new vaccines , including 8 cancer vaccines , 4 of which are already undergoing clinical trials , not only in Cuba but also in Canada , Argentina and the United Kingdom ; 21 innovative products for treating cancer , which supplement the 28 cytostatic drugs that have already been identified and which a new plant will soon begin manufacturing . Cuba's biotechnology centres have applied for patents for 150 inventions , which will bring the total of such patents to 505 . Four of these have been awarded medals by the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) . Countless prominent politicians , scientists and industrialists have visited Cuba's biotechnology institutions . One of its main centres alone played host in 2000 to 1,520 visitors , 484 of whom came from the United States . The doors of our research centres are open to any international institution . In an official , public letter , Cuba has written to the Government of the United States to propose three major draft agreements , which are of greater benefit to the United States than to Cuba itself , given the very different magnitude of the problems in each of the two countries . The first is a draft agreement on immigration issues ; the second , a draft agreement on cooperation in controlling the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the third , a draft bilateral cooperation programme to combat terrorism . We have not received any reply . Does this mean that we are being accused of manufacturing biological weapons ? Whom do they hope to intimidate in this way ? We are urged to cease any biological weapons-related cooperation with "" rogue "" States and to comply with all our obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention . Which is the international organization that decides whether or not a country is a "" rogue "" State ? Precisely which rule of the Biological Weapons Convention has Cuba violated ? Is it that , on top of the criminal blockade , they would now ban us from marketing our medicines and using the most beneficial , the most noble products of the talents and hard work of our scientists , they would prevent us from placing these at the service of the health of people anywhere in the world ? Or could it be that the United States Government is seeking another bilateral agreement , in addition to those proposed by Cuba , namely , on cooperation in efforts to combat the production of biological weapons ? Please propose it . We would be happy to include it in our list of projects under consideration . We are sorry , Mr. Bolton . After the lies , slander , fabrications and insults promulgated in your statement on 6 May , we regret to have to tell you that you have no moral ground to harangue Cuba on this subject , still less to do so in a threatening tone and language . Nor can you presume to give Cuba any lessons in politics and ethics . In any event , you and your Government should draw inspiration from Cuba's decent and honourable behaviour . I can assure you that , for this technology transfer , we shall be making no charge ."	0

1390	Feeds Minutes from Mar 2007 Exec Minutes - Planning Meeting 14th March 2007 Present All except Bruce who is in London , Candle who had no apologies and Morlark who 's location is unknown . Agenda Previous Minutes Commercial Websites on Tov Exec / TechTeam Policy Guidelines Planning Meeting Previous Minutes All accept previous minutes without problem . General agreement that minutes will be accepted unless anyone objects before hand . Commercial Websites on Tov Tim told the exec that there was one commercial website being hosted out of Tov that he knew about . He asked whether this was firstly sensible and secondly whether this broke any terms of service either we or the user had to agree to . General exec opinion was that this was a difficult topic , potential problems included legal action for downtime which could be a large amount if there was a significant problem . This was even a problem despite terms of service not guaranteeing any service level . Action Si is to email Union with regards this issue and obtain a legal clarification Exec / TechTeam Policy Guidelines Si presented this point stating that under Equal Ops and he felt obligations to members , there were certain areas which the Exec needed to produce a guidelines or ' policy ' for the TechTeam to ensure that problems were minimised . Several issues were given for instance the recent tech team decision on hardware needed to go through the Exec since it was a finance decision and not an entirely Tech Team area , secondly the potential for Equal Ops problems with regards IRC administration needed to be clarified and finally , as part of membership drive we present the services we offer as a reason to join , therefore there needed to be some cohesion to how we provide those and how we communicate to members if they are not going to be available . For instance , a warning on IRC 5 minutes before is not enough if this can be helped in some way . There seemed to much unease about this particularly from Exec members who were also on the Tech Team . Dan , Polar Bucko both stated that Si was trying to remove the fun from the Tech Team's role and effectively move into a situation where TechTeam was a boring entity . Si and Mullet both stated that they did n't want this to be the outcome , Si explicitly stating he did n't really care precisely about how tech problems were sorted but that there was no ramifications of unelected tech team members making a decision which affects membership or Union rules . The central problem is that unelected members are interpreting situations and making policy how they see fit rather than enforcing an enacting an agreed set of rules . Bucko suggested that we develop an ad-hoc arrangement to policy making whereby we react to a problem rather than attempt to develop policy for it beforehand . Most members felt this was sensible . More conversation followed . Following more heated discussion , Bucko took the constructive step of leaving to read Sanctuary in his paper . The end result is ultimately that the status quo will continue without any change since all Tech Team members on the Exec seemed to state that they felt there was no need for any development of policy . Planning Meeting This went on for a number of hours and raised various issues / plans the Exec want to look into . These are currently being actioned and where necessary will be discussed at future meetings or through email conversations with members . A.O.B. Exec Minutes - 9th March 2007 Present All , Candle and Bucko slightly late but participate in all discussions Agenda Previous Minutes Future Newsletters Week 10 Socials Sponsorship Gaming A.O.B Previous Minutes Generally previous minutes had been somewhat of a disaster due to use of PDF and unavailability due to a bad URL . Simon said he would try to sort this out and use Textile but generally would be helpful if people could pass on information before it became a problem with general membership . This will be improved in future . Action : All to read minutes with next 2 days ( via PDF ) and email exec with any problems . Future Newsletters Had also been a considerable problem due to formatting and missing information . Si also promised to try to improve these in future , if only to remove all the complains emails in his inbox . Action : Network Cable information to be included in future emails Action : Tech Team to provide script for news letters Action : Disk quota to be included in future newsletters Action : Newsletters to be sent to exec before being sent out Exec Minutes - 2nd March 2007 Exec List – Public or Private The group discussed various aspects of the issue which had been raised via email conversations over the week . Richard proposed we could adopt one of two existing styles – the WUGLUG discussion list style or alternatively a public read system . Fred stated that he preferred to have a public and private system – there could be a private list for closed communication , a public list for everything else . Dan stated that he would prefer a WUGLUG style system to be used in addition to the existing system . Bucko suggested that the exec list email goes private and external email goes public – with the intention of improving transparency . Richard proposed to have a public list and a private for closed businesses such as society communications and funding arrangements . Tim stated that he believed there was a perceived problem that the exec did not communicate to members well . Richard stated that it was every Exec members responsibility to try to communicate with the membership and answer their queries as much as possible . In particular , if perception was an issue then we needed to confront it head on . It was concluded to leave the exec list as is . Social with VGDSoc Richard said that conversations with VGDSoc had led to Tuesday Week 10 being suggested for a social . Action : Bucko to book rooms for Social Richard discussed a Laptop LAN and a Console session . Action : TechTeam to be ready for a Laptop LAN Action : Bucko to book two adjacent B rooms if possible . Schedule for 2007-2008 Richard said that we need a meeting to plan for the 2007-2008 academic year . Candle said we should do this at an exec meeting . Action : Next week's exec meeting to discuss 2007-2008 . Report on term 3 socials Bucko said he had completed the form for the term 3 BBQ but had not picked up the form yet . We would need to find a fire extinguisher . He had also agreed the Paintball Social times with Paintball soc . Bots of IRC Discussion centred around a private incident that had occurred on IRC recently . Details are not included in the minutes for privacy . T-shirts for Programming Competition Entrants Andrew said that he had not yet done anything with regards t-shirts . Their location was currently unknown . Action : Andrew to find t-shirts and to put them in the CompSoc cupboard . Email exec when this has been done . Prizes for Programming Competition Entrants Arun stated that we had promised exciting prizes but this was difficult to justify given the number of entrants . Nursery Project Richard explained that the nursery project had made some progress . In particular a number of developers had met the customer and she seemed happy with the product so far . It was also concluded that we should only accept a contract to maintain the product if sufficient financial incentive was available for the society , and also only for a period of one year , however the o ? cer seemed unlikely since ITS seemed likely to takeover maintenance of the product . Action : Andrew and Richard : to work on database over weekend . CompSoc Library Dan explained that OâReily were offering free evaluation copies and a 35 % discount to CompSoc members provided we wrote small reviews on the book . We are also obliged to place a banner on the CompSoc website . Action : Tech Team to inform Dan of what books are needed for upgrades . Action : Tech Team to place referral link on website . Action : Dan to investigate if we can donate books to library after review . Introduction to CompSoc PDF Arun introduced the topic ( which had also been discussed with the Tech Team . The idea is how to obtain services from CompSoc for new members . Agenda : Material for CompSoc PDF 07 Action : Arun in charge of PDF and Wiki Action : Arun to complete list of what the PDF will contain .

139	"Performance of a Contrarotating Small Wind Energy Converter 1 . Introduction Wind energy has been shown to be one of the most feasible sources of renewable energy . It presents attractive opportunities to a wide range of people , including investors and entrepreneurs . The main goal of wind energy industry is to minimize the cost of wind energy in order to make it more competitive compared to other energy sources . How to reduce the cost of wind energy is a vital engineering challenge presented by the interlocking disciplines of aerodynamics , structure , control , electrical conversion , and electronics . In fact , technologies in these related areas are still under active research and development to achieve high efficiency and low cost . In the shadows of advancing multimegawatt wind turbines is another growing sector within this industry , the small wind turbines . Small wind energy converters ( SWECs ) for urban or rural applications range in size from a few hundred watts to thousands of watts ( usually with a rated capacity of less than 100 kW ) and can be applied economically for a variety of power demands . These systems can be used in connection with an electricity transmission and distribution system , or in stand-alone applications that are not connected to the utility grid and are appropriate for homes , farms , or even entire communities . Investments in this sector are feasible not as stand-alone only , but as components of an integrated power-generating system that include various forms of energy resources . The main technical challenges for SWECs are the design of a system that has maximum efficiency in turbulent low speed winds ; ability to comply with both efficiency expectations and the requirements of grid utilities ; and have the minimum environmental and health impacts in terms of noise and vibration . Two facts characterize the urban environment for wind energy : lower annual mean wind speed ( AMWS ) compared to rural areas or to sea shores and more turbulent flow . The low AMWS is related to the uneven ground created by buildings and other features of the urban landscape , which causes wind speeds to increase with height above the ground more slowly . The turbulent flow is a result of the wind interacting with landscape obstacles , the fact that applies extra stress on the turbine blades . The challenge is to develop wind turbines that operate at lower speeds and cope with the turbulent . The wind generating technology development is leading to improved performance and efficiency . Most wind turbines are single-rotor systems , which provide simplicity , reliability , and durability . Along the years , improvements have enhanced energy conversion efficiency of these single-rotor systems . For example , blades have better aerodynamic characteristics , gears with reduced noise have better torque transmission efficiency , and alternators have better electrical efficiency . However , despite these improvements , single-rotor systems are able to convert only a small fraction of the total wind stream energy into electrical energy . Moreover , such a system requires high wind velocity ( above 4 m / s ) which is not available in many places , a part from costal regions . This low velocity and seasonal winds imply a high cost of exploitation of wind energy . Thus , the challenge lies with the design of a wind generator which can operate at lower speeds and be used in a small-scale manner in remote and rural areas . This paper investigates the performance of the SWEC basing on wind tunnel tests . The paper is organized as follows . Section 2 discusses the contrarotating concepts and provides a literature review on the subject , while Section 3 presents the theory of rotor torque and power . Section 4 describes the wind tunnel experimental setup , and Section 5 presents the rotor performance results . Finally , conclusions are drawn in Section 6 . 2 . Contrarotating Blade System The prime mover in wind energy system is the wind turbine . One prevailing trend in wind turbine technology throughout the past couple of decades has been growth in the size of the rotor to realize the advantages of scale and the generally higher winds available at greater heights . Geometrically , consistent upscaling of blade length shows that the surface stresses at the blade surface , vibratory loads , and loading noise due to aerodynamical and gravitational loads grow in proportion to the length of the blade [ 1 ] . However , an alternative mean of overcoming the limitation of the efficiency of a single-rotor system without increasing the size of the rotor and consequently the stress on blades could be through the adoption of a dual-rotor ( contrarotating ) blade system . In addition , the acceptance of wind turbines by the public depends strongly on achieving low noise levels in operation , which largely depends on the level of stress on the blades . According to Betz theory , the maximum power that can be extracted from the wind is about 59 % of the available energy in the wind when the axial wind speed is reduced by two-thirds across a single rotor disc . However , practical wind turbines convert less than 40 % of the wind energy into electrical energy . Hence , nearly 60 % of the potential wind energy escapes without being harnessed . In reality , the energy in the wake behind a single rotor is not very small . Part of this energy may be extracted further by installing a second rotor in the wake . As the wake behind the first rotor is rotating in the opposite direction to the rotational direction of the rotor , the second rotor should rotate in the same direction as the wake in order to extract efficiently the available energy in the wake . The contrarotating system is a very old concept that was initially proposed more than 100 years ago . A friend of Betz who is sometimes described as the "" father of modern wind energy collection theory , "" Hans Honneff , wrote a book on the use of contrarotation , using two rotors one behind the other , driving the two halves of an electrical generator , therefore creating a true wind turbine [ 2 ] . Currently , the contra concept is used on airplanes , boats , and submarines to increase efficiency while eliminating the asymmetrical torque faced by conventional rotors . A dual-rotor system can be described as a system consisting of two rotors separated by an appropriate distance ( Figure 1 ) . One of the rotors is rotating in counterclockwise direction and the other in clockwise direction on the same axis . The relative size as well as the appropriate distance between the two rotors should be identified for best performance . Drawbacks of the dual-rotor system come from mechanical complexity based on the fact that in order to reverse direction of rotation of one rotor , a gearbox is required . This may increase weight or maintenance and spare parts cost for the system . Based on evidence in literature , aerodynamic research is poised between experimental and computational : either the wind turbine is studied experimentally in a wind tunnel , or the turbine is investigated computationally using methods that belong to the field of computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) . The two are closely linked , and as progress is made in the development of more advanced computational fluid models , more comprehensive wind tunnel experimental data is required to validate the models . Experimental and computational research provide results for better understanding of the flow physics and enable investigation of wind energy performance , a requirement in order to adjust the design of wind turbines to the unique aerodynamic conditions in the environment . As with all methods of analysis , the CFD approach has limitations which are essentially related to turbulence modeling . Sumner et al. [ 3 ] review the development of CFD as a virtual , multiscale wind tunnel applied by the wind energy community from small to large scale . Although the cost of a CFD analysis may be comparable to that of a wind tunnel experiment , we considered the wind tunnel experimental option for the current study emphasizing on the importance of transition to turbulence effects . Typically , wind tunnel tests overstate performance , and consumers will never see the performance measured in a wind tunnel . However , such tests are good indicators of performance . To our knowledge , only a limited number of wind tunnel studies can be found in literature [ 2 , 4 ] . In order to study the streamlines and obtain the detailed information of flow around the wind turbine , a flow visualization and velocity measurement are important . Investigation [ 5 ] has been carried out for this sake . Considerable improvements in the understanding of contrarotating wind turbine system can be achieved through proper instrumentation and experimental measurements . According to [ 6 ] , the maximum power that can be extracted from a dual-rotor system increases up to 64 % of the available energy . It continues to reach 66.7 % for an infinite number of rotors [ 7 ] . A contrarotating wind turbine equipped with two 500 kW turbines performed quite well at high wind speeds . The turbine can produce 43.5 % more annual energy than a single-rotor turbine of the same type . The performance of the system can be improved if it is operated for low wind speeds at the tip-speed ratio where a maximum Cp is obtained [ 8 ] . Research studies provide sufficient evidence to look closer at the concept of contrarotating system to eventually produce quantifiable comparisons to other turbines [ 9 , 10 ] . A smaller gear ratio is needed because of higher tip speeds achieved by smaller blade length in comparison with the conventional system in case of the same power output . Energy capture in the rotor holds the greatest potential for long-term reduction of the cost of wind energy . A feasibility study [ 11 ] provides sufficient evidence to look closer at the concept of contrarotating to eventually produce quantifiable comparisons to other turbines . Their field tests showed that a dual-rotor turbine produces 43.5 % more annual energy than a single-rotor turbine of the same type . In addition , a smaller gear ratio is needed because of higher tip speeds achieved by smaller blade length in comparison with the conventional system in case of the same power output [ 12 ] . According to a field test demonstrated in California [ 13 ] , energy extraction from a wind turbine using contrarotating system increased by up to 40 % over an equivalent wind turbine with only one rotor . Power conversion efficiency was high at low rotor speeds , suggesting applicability of contrarotating turbines to large utility-scale wind turbines that rotate at 16 – 20 rpm . In addition , the bending stress on the supporting tower was reduced by the contrarotating system over the single-rotor system . This reduced bending stress results when the torques produced by two rotors counterbalance each other . The contrarotating SWEC clearly has a promise for wind energy , and after preliminary research and field studies [ 6 – 13 ] , it was decided to proceed with a small SWEC prototype for testing and evaluation . 3 . Rotor Torque and Power The motion of any fluid can be derived from the basic physical principles of mass , momentum , and energy interchange . The torque responsible for power production of the wind turbine mostly arises due to the forces produced by interaction of blades with the wind . The output power P T from a turbine rotor and the wind kinetic energy per unit time P W are given as follows : P T = T m P × ω , W = 1 2 ρ × V 3 0 × A , ( 1 ) where T m is the mechanical torque at the turbine side , ω is the angular rotation of the shaft , ρ is the air density at the hub height , V 0 is the wind velocity , and A is the swept area of the blades . If momentum equation is solved across an idealized control volume about the turbine rotor , it can be shown that the percentage of the total power available that can be extracted by a turbine is 16 / 27 or 59 % . This limit is known as the Betz limit . Therefore , the maximum power that a turbine can produce is expressed as follows [ 14 ] : P W = 1 6 1 2 7 2 ρ × V 3 0 × A. ( 2 ) Most turbines extract the maximum possible energy as defined above for lower wind speeds but gradually become less efficient as the on-coming wind speed increases and the flow condition across the blades approaches the stall condition . The rotor power coefficient C p is defined as the ratio between the rotor output power and the dynamic power of the air as shown in the following : C p = P T P W = T m × ω ( 1 / 2 ) ρ × V 3 0 × A. ( 3 ) The power coefficient is a nonlinear function of the tip speed-ratio λ , which depends on the wind velocity and the rotation speed of the shaft V λ = T i p V 0 = r × ω V 0 , ( 4 ) where r is the rotor radius . The rotor power coefficient is regarded as the energy transformation efficiency . Note that C p is usually precomputed based on the theoretically expected performance of the turbine system . The wind turbine mechanical characteristics are described by the following equation ( where the turbine rotor friction is ignored ) : T m − T g = J d ω d t , ( 5 ) where T g is the load torque , and J is the turbine inertia moment . The incoming wind flow rate should be equal to the outgoing flow rate to satisfy the mass conservation law if a control volume around a turbine is assumed . The outgoing wind-speed distribution and its direction strongly determine the turbine efficiency . Figure 2 shows the geometry of the stream tube through the disk . Neglecting fluid drags , the power extracted from the air stream can be written as 1 P = ( 6 ) where V , and V are the flow velocity components along the axis of the stream tube . The power coefficient is obtained by nondimensionalizing the above power equation as C , ( 7 ) where a is the axial induction factor . 4 . Wind Tunnel Experimental Setup In this section , laboratory measurement techniques are discussed ; however , some of the methods used are conventional and require little elaboration . 4.1 . Wind Tunnel Facility An open-return type wind tunnel is used in the present study . A contrarotating model 3-blade wind turbine was placed in the boundary-layer wind tunnel with the goal of studying power performance , turbulence effect , and flow visualization . Figure 3 shows the schematic of the wind tunnel experimental setup where the contraction and test sections are on the right hand side , and the motor and fan are in the left hand side . Air enters the fan from the laboratory through a large gate covered by a filter , held by wire meshes . The air flow is driven by a propulsion system made of an axial fan to provide the dynamic pressure for compensating viscous losses . There are smooth glass walls on both sides of the tunnel , and access is possible through the plywood ceiling and floor . Any large obstruction placed within a wind tunnel will alter the characteristics of the flow to some degree . The wind tunnel is capable of generating wind speeds up to 30 m / s. This suction type wind tunnel has a cross-section of 0.61 m width by 0.9 m height . The tunnel has a working ( test ) section of length 3.6 m . As the test section is the narrowest part of the circuit , it is also the part where the air velocity is the highest and , therefore , by Bernoulli's principle , where the pressure is the lowest . The main distinguishing feature of this wind tunnel is that it was designed to produce a low level of turbulence in the test section . Power for the tunnel comes from a three-phase AC motor of 30 hp at 1800 rpm with a maximum speed of 1170 rpm , driving a 10-bladed fan of 54 inches diameter with blade setting of 23 ° , mounted in a cylindrical steel casing . To minimise noise and vibration , the casing is supported on rubber shock mounts and is connected by flexible seals to the tunnel on either side . The air speed does not change as the air passes through the fan . The rotational speed of the fan is controlled by a regulated magnetic field and solid-state power supply . In order to control the ambient turbulence level , turbulence manipulators are placed upstream of the rotor , including a fine mesh screen and an aluminum honeycomb section . Smoothing is provided by the fine mesh screen . The honeycomb plays the role of a flow straightener . When the wind turbine is stopped , the mean velocity over the center portion of the wind tunnel is uniform and almost steady . 4.2 . Instrumentation A small model SWEC with two blade sets of 23 cm diameter and a varying distance between the blade sets of 7 – 54 cm has been built and tested over a range of operating conditions . In order to introduce some degree of uniformity into the way in which users of the wind tunnel record their data , an instrumentation system to measure and display a number of variables that are normally required for all experiments was installed . Two guide rails were used to hold the SWEC inside wind tunnel floor along the centreline using a steel mounting system . The steel mounting system ensured that the system did not move during testing . Measuring sensors were mounted at different locations of the setup . The upwind and downwind velocities are measured by pitot tubes , which use Bernoulli's principle to convert pressure to velocity readings . The tubes are attached to 2 sensors to convert pressure in volts to velocities in m / s. For measuring the rotational speed of the rotor , two infrared detector and emitter units ( photogate sensors ) were used . They were mounted behind the rotor . Measurement depends largely on a data acquisition system utilizing electronic measuring to read instantaneous power produced by the generating system , as various parameters are varied on the turbine or in the environment . The parameters varied include the distance between the two sets of blades , blade profiles , number of blades , wind speeds , and size ratios . To accomplish the objective of this test , three aspects of experimental setup are needed : mechanical , electrical , and measurement software . All sensors are powered , grounded , and connected to the data acquisition board . All wires are shielded for protection against noise . Measurements are monitored directly and instantaneously in the Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) of LabView . The user enters numerical values of the blade distance , blade pitch , and blade diameter for the front and back and the relative humidity and temperature . The circuit has 5 sets of measurements on both the front and the back of the generating system . The voltages are measured directly from the potentiometers ; these are the total voltages of the circuits . The currents are obtained by measuring the voltages from fixed resistors and dividing that by the resistance . The power is the product of the voltage and the calculated current . The rpm signals go through a frequency measurement tool in LabView and are then multiplied by 60 to obtain the angular velocity in revolutions per minute ( rpm ) . All lines of measurements are connected to the National Instruments Data Acquisition Board NIDAQ USB-6210 . Each line is connected to an analog pin which is fed into the LabView program with a USB connection to the computer . At the beginning of the measurement process , all sensors were checked and calibrated . The pitot tubes are corrected by the offset values to give zero when there is no wind in the tunnel . When starting the program , a path is requested for an Excel file to record the data ."	3
1536	CORE MESSAGE AREA : READING / LITERACY Introduction : The revision of the Reading / Literacy Core Messages was based on significant advances in the national research community concerning best practices to improve reading and literacy ( reading , writing , speaking , and listening across the curriculum areas ) . Two critical examples are the National Institute of Education Sciences 1 and the What Works Clearinghouse 2 , which provide resources to objectively evaluate programs and practices according to accepted rules of science . In addition , the creation of national Common Core Standards 3 along with the move towards organizing interventions in a Response to Intervention ( RTI ) 4 framework have created exciting and challenging new opportunities for improving outcomes for California's students . It is important to note that Reading is a part of the larger context of Academic Literacy . Academic Literacy is defined as the skills of reading / writing / speaking and listening that all work together across the content areas . This unified concept is clearly aligned with the Common Core Standards that use reading and literacy across the curricular areas and present both as a shared teaching responsibility .	4

171	"This is my first time at TED . Normally , as an advertising man , I actually speak at TED Evil , which is TED's secret sister organization -- the one that pays all the bills . It 's held every two years in Burma . And I particularly remember a really good speech by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again . ( Laughter ) But , actually , it 's suddenly come to me after years working in the business , that what we create in advertising , which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value , you might call it badge value , subjective value , intangible value of some kind -- gets rather a bad rap . If you think about it , if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods , you basically have two choices . You can either live in a world which is poorer , which people in general do n't like . Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value , that actually intangible value , in many ways is a very , very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things . Here is one example . This is a train which goes from London to Paris . The question was given to a bunch of engineers , about 15 years ago , "" How do we make the journey to Paris better ? "" And they came up with a very good engineering solution , which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from London to the coast , and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time . Now , call me Mister Picky . I 'm just an ad man ...... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter . Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks ? Here is my naive advertising man's suggestion . What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels , pay them to walk the length of the train , handing out free Chateau Petrus for the entire duration of the journey . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , you 'll still have about three billion pounds left in change , and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down . ( Laughter ) Now , here is another naive advertising man's question again . And this shows that engineers , medical people , scientific people , have an obsession with solving the problems of reality , when actually most problems , once you reach a basic level of wealth in society , most problems are actually problems of perception . So I 'll ask you another question . What on earth is wrong with placebos ? The seem fantastic to me . They cost very little to develop . They work extraordinarily well . They have no side effects , or if they do , they 're imaginary , so you can safely ignore them . ( Laughter ) So I was discussing this . And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog by Tyler Cowen . I do n't know if anybody knows it . Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further , and actually produce placebo education . The point is that education does n ' t actually work by teaching you things . It actually works by giving you the impression that you 've had a very good education , which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted self confidence , which then makes you very , very successful in later life . So , welcome to Oxford , ladies and gentlemen . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But , actually , the point of placebo education is interesting . How many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception , rather than that tedious , hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality ? Here 's a great example from history . I 've heard this attributed to several other kings , but doing a bit of historical research it seems to be Fredrick the Great . Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very very keen for the Germans to adopt the potato , and to eat it . Because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate , wheat and potatoes , you get less price volatility in bread . And you get a far lower risk of famine , because you actually had two crops to fall back on , not one . The only problem is : potatoes , if you think about it , look pretty disgusting . And also , 18th century Prussians ate very , very few vegetables -- rather like contemporary Scottish people . ( Laughter ) So , actually , he tried making it compulsory . The Prussian peasantry said , "" We ca n ' t even get the dogs to eat these damn things . They are absolutely disgusting and they 're good for nothing . "" There are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes . So he tried plan B. He tried the marketing solution , which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable . And none but the royal family could consume it . And he planted it in a royal potato patch , with guards who had instructions to guard over it , night and day , but with secret instructions not to guard it very well . ( Laughter ) Now 18th century peasants know that there is one pretty safe rule in life , which is if something is worth guarding , it 's worth stealing . Before long , there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in Germany . What he 'd effectively done is he 'd re-branded the potato . It was an absolute masterpiece . I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said , "" Very , very good marketer , Fredrick the Great . But not a patch on Ataturk . "" Ataturk , rather like Nicolas Sarkozy , was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil , in Turkey , to modernize it . Now , boring people would have just simply banned the veil . But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback and a hell of a lot of resistance . Ataturk was a lateral thinker . He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I ca n ' t verify that fully . But it does not matter . There is your environmental problem solved , by the way , guys : All convicted child molesters have to drive a Porsche Cayenne . ( Laughter ) What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things . Which is that , actually , first one , all value is actually relative . All value is perceived value . For those of you who do n't speak Spanish , jugo de naranja -- it 's actually the Spanish for "" orange juice . "" Because actually it 's not the dollar . It 's actually the peso in Buenos Aires . Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment to any passing gringo tourists . As an advertising man , I have to admire that . But the first thing this all shows is that all value is subjective . Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion . These funny signs that flash your speed at you , some of the new ones , on the bottom right , now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face , to act as an emotional trigger . What 's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera . But they prevent twice as many accidents . So , the bizarre thing which is baffling to conventional , classically trained economists , is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a £ 60 fine and three penalty points . Tiny little behavioral economics detail : in Italy , penalty points go backwards . You start with 12 and they take them away . Because the found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people's behavior . In Britain we tend to feel , "" Whoa ! Got another three ! "" Not so in Italy . Another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value , which remember , is what , after all , the environmental movement needs to be about : This , again , is from Prussia , from , I think , about 1812 , 1813 . The wealthy Prussians , to help in war against the French , were encouraged to give in all their jewelry . And it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron . Here 's one : "" Gold gab ich für Eisen , 1813 . "" The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence , the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia was n ' t made of gold or diamonds . It was made of cast iron . Because actually , never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry . This actually had symbolic value , badge value . It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past . So , the modern equivalent would of course be this . ( Laughter ) But , actually , there is a thing , just as there are Veblen goods , where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare -- there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous , classless and minimalistic . If you think about it , Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement . Adam Smith talks about 18th century America where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great , it was almost a block in the economy in New England , because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on , without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors . It 's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to more egalitarian societies . What 's also interesting , if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value , a high component of intangible value , versus their intrinsic value : They are often quite egalitarian . In terms of dress , denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value . Coca-Cola . A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos , and you may not like the Coca-Cola company . But it 's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke . What Warhol said about Coke is , he said , "" What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States ca n ' t get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street . "" Now , that is , actually , when you think about it , we take it for granted -- it 's actually a remarkable achievement , to produce something that 's so democratic . Now , we basically have to change our views slightly . There is a basic view that real value involves making things , involves labor . It involves engineering . It involves limited raw materials . And that what we add on top is kind of false . It 's a fake version . And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it . It patently veers toward propaganda . However , what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value . And it 's much fairer . When I grew up , this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food . You had a monopoly supplier . On the left , you have Rupert Murdoch , or the BBC . ( Laughter ) And on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it . ( Laughter ) Nowadays , the user is actually involved . This is actually what 's called , in the digital world , "" user-generated content . "" Although it 's called agriculture , in the world of food . ( Laughter ) This is actually called a mash-up , where you take content that someone else has produced and you do something new with it . In the world of food we call it cooking . This is food 2.0 , which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people . This is mobile food . British are very good at that . Fish and chips in newspaper , the Cornish Pastie , the pie , the sandwich . We invented the whole lot of them . We 're not very good at food in general . Italians do great food , but it 's not very portable , generally . ( Laughter ) I only learned this the other day . The Earl of Sandwich did n't invent the sandwich . He actually invented the toasty . But then , the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name . ( Laughter ) Finally , we have contextual communication . Now , the reason I show you Pernod -- it 's only one example . Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink . In France it 's Pernod . It tastes great within the borders of that country . But absolute shite if you take it anywhere else . ( Laughter ) Unicum in Hungary , for example . The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina , which even tastes shite when you 're in Greece . ( Laughter ) But so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people , for giving them better information -- B. J. Fogg , at the University of Stanford , makes the point that actually the mobile phone is -- He 's invented the phrase , "" persuasive technologies . "" He believes the mobile phone , by being location-specific , contextual , timely and immediate , is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented . Now , if we have all these tools at our disposal , we simply have to ask the question , and Thaler and Sunstein have , of how we can use these more intelligently . I 'll give you one example . If you had a large red button of this kind , on the wall of your home , and every time you pressed it it saved 50 dollars for you , put 50 dollars into your pension , you would save a lot more . The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior . Okay ? Now , marketing has done a very very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying . Yet we 've never created the opportunity for impulse saving . If you did this , more people would save more . It 's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions . And the very nature of the decisions changes . Obviously , I do n't want people to do this , because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed . ( Laughter ) But if anybody did want to do that , that 's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about , actually : fundamental opportunities to change human behavior . Now , I 've got an example here from Canada . There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada called Hunter Somerville , who was working in improv in Toronto , and got a part-time job in advertising , and was given the job of advertising Shreddies . Now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible added value , without changing the product in the slightest . Shreddies is a strange , square , whole-grain cereal , only available in New Zealand , Canada and Britain . It 's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown . ( Laughter ) In working out how you could relaunch Shreddies , he came up with this . Video : ( Buzzer ) Man : Shreddies is supposed to be square . ( Laughter ) Woman : Have any of these diamond shapes gone out ? ( Laughter ) Voiceover : New Diamond Shreddies cereal . Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape . ( Applause ) Rory Sutherland : I 'm not sure this is n't the most perfect example of intangible value creation . All it requires is photons , neurons , and a great idea to create this thing . I would say it 's a work of genius . But , naturally , you ca n ' t do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research . Man : So , Shreddies is actually producing a new product , which is something very exciting for them . So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies . ( Laughter ) So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that , when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there . ( Laughter ) Woman : Were n ' t they square ? Woman # 2 : I 'm a little bit confused . Woman # 3 : They look like the squares to me . Man : They -- Yeah , it 's all in the appearance . But it 's kind of like flipping a six or a nine like a six . If you flip it over it looks like a nine . But a six is very different from a nine . Woman # 3 : Or an "" M "" and a "" W "" . Man : An "" M "" and a "" W "" , exactly . Man # 2 : [ unclear ] You just looked like you turned it on its end . But when you see it like that it 's more interesting looking . Man : Just try both of them . Take a square one there , first . ( Laughter ) Man : Which one did you prefer ? Man # 2 : The first one . Man : The first one ? ( Laughter ) Rory Sutherland : Now , naturally , a debate raged . There were conservative elements in Canada , unsurprisingly , who actually resented this intrusion . So , eventually , the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise , which was the combo pack . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) If you think it 's funny , bear in mind there is an organization called the American Institute of Wine Economics , which actually does extensive research into perception of things , and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people , there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine , except when you tell the people how expensive it is , in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more . So drink your wine blind in the future . But this is both hysterically funny -- but I think an important philosophical point , which is , going forward , we need more of this kind of value . We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists , and less time agonizing over what else we can do . Two quotations to more or less end with . One of them is , "" Poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new . "" Which is n't a bad definition of what our job is , to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar , but also to gain a greater appreciation , and place a far higher value on those things which are already existing . There is some evidence , by the way , that things like social networking help do that . Because they help people share news . They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities . So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display , and increase the kind of third-party enjoyment you can get from the smallest , simplest things in life . Which is magic . The second one is the second G. K. Chesterton quote of this session , which is , "" We are perishing for want of wonder , not for want of wonders , "" which I think for anybody involved in technology , is perfectly true . And a final thing : When you place a value on things like health , love , sex and other things , and learn to place a material value on what you 've previously discounted for being merely intangible , a thing not seen , you realize you 're much much wealthier than you ever imagined . Thank you very much indeed . ( Applause ) </content"	0

1668	"Tibbetts Brook , originally Tippett's Brook or Tibbitt's Brook , is a stream in the southern portion of mainland New York , flowing north to south from the city of Yonkers in Westchester County into the borough of the Bronx within New York City . Originally emptying into Spuyten Duyvil Creek as part of the Harlem River system , the stream is now partially subterranean , ending above ground at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake within Van Cortlandt Park . There it proceeds into city sewers , draining into either the northern end of the Harlem River or the Wards Island Water Pollution Control Plant . The brook provides significant watershed to both Van Cortlandt Park at its south end and Tibbetts Brook Park at its north end . There have been modern proposals to daylight the southern portion of the brook back onto the surface . Contents Top : The original course of Spuyten Duyvil Creek and its junction with Tibbetts Brook , and the island of Paparinemo ( now Kingsbridge , Bronx ) Bottom : An 1895 map of Van Cortlandt Park , showing the course of Tibbetts Brook through the park lake , and its original crossing point with Broadway . Tibbetts Brook originates at H.F. Redmond Junior Memorial Park just north of Yonkers Avenue in Dunwoodie , Yonkers . It proceeds south through two artificial lakes in Tibbetts Brook Park , on a course parallel and adjacent to the Saw Mill River Parkway and the former New York and Putnam Railroad ( now a park trail ) . South of the park the brook runs in a channel directly adjacent to the northbound side of the parkway , then crosses the Yonkers / Bronx border into Van Cortlandt Park . It runs through the center of the Van Cortlandt Golf Course , then empties into Van Cortlandt Lake , an artificial lake created in 1699 by damming the stream . The brook currently ends at the south edge of the lake , at approximately West 242nd Street . Several storm drains feed excess rainwater into the brook within Yonkers . At the brook's mouth , the water from the brook proceeds into a brick sewer tunnel , which later merges with the major city sewer underneath Broadway that carries rainwater , household wastewater , and industrial sewage . The tunnel primarily drains into the Wards Island Water Pollution Control Plant where city sewage is treated . During rainy conditions the sewer overflows into the north end of the Harlem River , via a drain pipe at about West 192nd Street ( Heath Avenue ) . Due to modern development , the brook runs through underpasses and culverts at various points along its course . As recently as the early 20th Century , Tibbets Brook had two northern tributaries which merged at the north end of modern Tibbets Brook Park . The easternmost began in Redmond Park , while the western stream extended as far as Runyon Heights . The two streams originally merged at Peckham's Lake , later converging at the lakes of Tibbets Brook Park following the completion of the park . The Saw Mill Parkway was built over the western stream in the late 1920s . Until the end of the 19th century , the brook extended past the south end of Van Cortlandt Park . It ran southwest through the site of the current Van Cortlandt Stadium , crossed Broadway at around West 240th Street , then continued southwest through the Kingsbridge neighborhood , running a twisty course along the right-of-way of modern Tibbett Avenue . At approximately West 230th Street , just north of the current site of John F. Kennedy High School , the brook drained into Spuyten Duyvil Creek , which at the time separated the Bronx from Marble Hill , Manhattan . Until the 1700s , Tibbets Brook split into two smaller streams at around West 237th Street , the westernmost and primary stream along modern Tibbett Avenue feeding into the Spuyten Duyvil , and the easternmost along the right-of-ways of the Putnam Railroad and current Major Deegan Expressway feeding into the Harlem River . The two streams formed a triangular island called Paparinemo that constitutes much of today's Kingsbridge neighborhood . The brook had numerous tributaries , including several within modern Van Cortlandt Park . The north end of the brook within Yonkers and the park is entirely fresh water , while south of the park it was a tidal estuary lined with salt marshes . The watershed from the brook created wetlands surrounding the stream , and formed a northern extension of the Harlem River valley . The original Spuyten Duyvil Creek course has since been filled in , replaced by the Harlem River Ship Canal . An 1867 map of Yonkers and Western Bronx , showing the course of Tibbetts Brook ( in red ) prior to modern development . Tibbetts Brook was originally referred to as Mosholu by local Lenape Native Americans , an Algonquin word meaning "" smooth stones "" or "" small stones "" . The Mosholu name was later given to Mosholu Parkway . The label Tibbetts Brook was applied by European settlers , named after George Tippett who held property between the Hudson River and Bronx River in the late 17th Century , with the brook running through the center . Although often considered a corruption of the name Tippett , the label may be a combination of the name of Tippett and that of his father-in-law William Betts , who owned the land along with him . The brook has also been referred to as the Yonkers River or Yonkers Creek in the past , previously written as Jonckers or Uncas . During at least three glacial periods , including the Wisconsin glaciation around 20,000 years ago , ice sheets advanced south across North America carving moraines , valleys , and hills across present-day Bronx and Westchester . As the glacial ice melted , rivers and creeks were formed within valleys , including Tibbetts Brook . Prior to European colonization , the local Lenape population utilized the brook for drinking water and fishing . Trout swam up the Harlem River in order to use the freshwater portion of the brook as a spawning site . The salt marshes along the stream housed fish and migratory birds , along with mussels , oysters , and crabs . In the 1690s , Jacobus Van Cortlandt acquired property near Tibbetts Brook from his relative Frederick Philipse , located in modern Van Cortlandt Park . This area was called "" George's Point "" , where the brook turned west towards Broadway . In 1699 , Van Cortlandt dammed the stream in order to power a gristmill and sawmill , creating Van Cortlandt Lake as a mill pond in the process . By the 19th Century , the eastern stream was filled in , connecting Kingsbridge to the rest of the Bronx . From 1872 to 1880 , the New York and Putnam Railroad was built along the Tibbetts Brook valley . The construction of the railroad altered the natural drainage pattern of the brook , leading new marshes to develop around it . In 1888 , the New York City Parks Department acquired the land to create Van Cortlandt Park . The Parks Department began draining the brook wetlands for recreational areas , creating the park's parade ground in 1888 and the Van Cortlandt Golf Course in 1895 . The lake flows south into a drain pipe to the Broadway sewer Between the late 1890s and the early 1910s , around the time the original course of Spuyten Duyvil Creek was filled in and replaced by the Harlem River Ship Canal , the double-arched Broadway sewer was constructed , as was the tunnel at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake to funnel water from the brook into the sewer . The marshlands created by the brook and lake had drawn the ire of local residents and property owners , who believed them to be "" unsightly and unsanitary "" . Of particular concern was the threat of the wetlands serving as breeding grounds for malaria - borne mosquitoes . The Broadway Outlet Sewer was completed in 1907 . In conjunction with the sewer project , from 1903 to 1911 the Parks Department completed a cleaning and improvement project for the Van Cortlandt Lake . This involved removing the original earthen dam and emptying the lake in order to dredge the lake bed to a lower depth . A new dam was installed to reform the lake . The drain pipe between the lake and Broadway sewer was constructed from 1911 to 1912 . It was originally envisioned as cast-iron , but built using brick . Around this time , Tibbett Avenue was laid out and opened , while much of the marshland within the park and along the former river course was filled in . On June 25 , 1927 , Westchester County opened Tibbetts Brook Park near the northern end of the brook , on land previously confiscated from the Tippett estate . Much of the site had been a Yonkers city garbage dump located on the banks of the western brook tributary . The garbage and residential sewage seeped into the stream , which fed polluted water into Peckham's Lake . The lake had been used by residents as a swimming hole in spite of recommendations against it by health officials . The area immediately south of the lake had been a swamp which was a haven for mosquitoes . As part of the creation of the park , the original lake was filled in , while the swamp was dredged to form the current Tibbetts Lake . The brook , meanwhile , was diverted into a paved channel . The eastern tributary had been protected by fences and infrastructure from the nearby Old Croton Aqueduct . At the time the park was constructed , the southern portion of the Saw Mill River Parkway was built on top of the dump along the western tributary course . Between the 1930s and 1960s under the supervision of Robert Moses , several highways including the Henry Hudson , Saw Mill and Mosholu Parkways were constructed within Van Cortlandt Park , requiring Tibbetts Brook to be diverted into culverts under the roadways . The creation of the sewer at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake and the construction of the highways induced siltation of the stream , leading to further creation of marshes . In addition , pollution from upstream and the highways , and spillover of chemicals used in the golf course led to the death of fish inhabiting the lake . In 1978 , the fish population of the lake was restored . In 1979 , four storm sewers along Midland Avenue in Yonkers ( which forms the eastern boundary of Tibbetts Brook Park ) were found to be illegally connected to the brook , pumping raw sewage into it which proceeded to enter Van Cortlandt Lake downstream . That year , another storm drain located at approximately Lawton Street and McLean Avenue near the Saw Mill Parkway , 1,300 feet ( 400 m ) north of the Yonkers / Bronx border , was found to be leaking household sewage into the brook . In 1984 , sewage from Yonkers was again found to be contaminating Van Cortlandt Lake , due to the crossing of raw sewage pipes and storm sewers which feed into Tibbetts Brook . This included water from the Lawton Street drain pipe . The same sewage pipe was found to be the cause of pollution of the lake in 2016 . In the 21st century , it has been proposed to daylight the southern portion of Tibbetts Brook back onto the surface , and to restore and defragment the portions of the stream within Van Cortlandt Park . Proposals to daylight the stream have existed since the 1990s . Around 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 US gallons ( 15 , 000 , 000 to 19,000,000 l ; 3,300,000 to 4,200,000 imp gal ) of fresh water from the brook enter the sewer system on a daily basis , a total of 2,000,000,000 US gallons ( 7 . 6 × 10 9 l ; 1.7 × 10 9 imp gal ) annually . The additional water from the brook also contributes to the further overflowing of raw sewage into the Harlem River during rainy conditions . Meanwhile , the lack of natural drainage points within Van Cortlandt Park leads to the flooding of recreational areas within the park . The New York City Parks Department plans to daylight the brook as part of their "" Van Cortlandt Park Master Plan : 2030 "" . The plan also proposes further dredging the lake and stream within the park , and rerouting the stream away from the highways and pedestrian paths to minimize the use of culverts , as well as restoring the natural wetlands created by the brook . The primary route proposed for bringing the brook above ground is the former Putnam Railroad right-of-way , which is currently owned by CSX Transportation but is largely abandoned between the park and the Harlem River . This portion of the Putnam Railroad is directly adjacent to the southbound lanes of the Major Deegan Expressway . The routing would provide a more natural drainage path for the brook into the Harlem River , with none of the water entering the sewer system on a normal basis . ^ Cook , Lyman ( September 5 , 1820 ) .

361	"Recorder players are most likely to be familiar with Robin Walker's A Book of Song and Dance ( both the edition published by Forsyth Brothers and a recording of the collection have been reviewed in The Recorder Magazine ) pieces from which have been included in grade exam syllabuses . This CD provides an opportunity to hear two more of Walker's recorder pieces together with a selection of other instrumental works composed during the last twenty years . Mr Gilbert dines at the Modern Hindu Hotel for descant recorder and piano was composed in 1994 to celebrate composer Anthony Gilbert's 60th birthday . Lasting a little under three minutes and certainly an occasional piece , it is nevertheless a significant work , exploring textures and sonorities found also in Rite in A Book of Song and Dance composed at around the same time . His Master's Voice for sopranino recorder and piano was written in 2001 for Walker's composition teacher David Lumsdain on his 70th birthday . It proceeds in alternate calm and energetic sections that achieve further contrast by setting the recorder very effectively against the piano's higher and lower registers . This and the above are two recorder works striking in their originality that leave you eager to hear more of walker's work for the instrument . His years as a chorister in York Minster under the direction of Francis Jackson clearly gave Walker a strong sense of organ sonorities that is very evident in two impressive works for the instrument , Dances with Chant and Chorales and Invention . The earliest composition on the disc is Dance / Still for the unusual ensemble of flute , clarinet , violin , cello , guitar and percussion ( two players ) written in 1982 . Here , the influence on Walker of his study-visits to India is particularly evident in the rhythmic freedom and expressiveness . The piano piece At the Grave of William Baines was written for the centenary of the Yorkshire composer ( 1899-1922 ) . Lasting nearly fifteen minutes , it captures something of the spirit of Baines' own works for piano , but also reflects Walker's own response to the instrument . In total contrast is the work for pianola , Halifax . The composer describes it as a mechanical fantasy , and as the piece progresses , an almost musical box-like quality takes over from and contrasts with the heavier almost mill-like sounds of the opening . The most personal work on the disc is the short , single movement string quartet , I Thirst , from 1994 . Walker reflects on one of Christ's Seven Last Words in a work of extraordinary atmosphere , beginning and punctuated with viola solos and making use of chords in quiet harmonics for the entire quartet . The performances by all involved are impressive . Walker's music engages the performer ( and the listener ) and is clearly born out of inspiration rather than formulation . This is something in which Walker believes passionately and about which he has written in his contribution in the symposium Reviving the Muse , ( edited by Peter Davison and published by Claridge Press ) . A disc revealing a very original musical personality who composes for the recorder with the same creativity he brings to all his instrumental works - Andrew Mayes Review by Roger Carpenter in The British Music Society In an age when so much - too much - new music is hardly more than soulless note-spinning striving for effect , Robin Walker stands apart , a classicist at heart , who writes from the heart in a wholly contemporary idiom , at once distinctive and attractive ; in short , he is that modern rara avis , a composer whose music leaves you wanting to hear more . This impeccably produced , performed and recorded disc presents a conspectus of his developing work over two decades , ever subject to experiment and expansion into new fields , ranging from Dance / Still , the chamber piece which first brought him to public notice , to the neatly titled His Master's Voice , a 70th birthday tribute to his composition teacher , David Lumsdaine . One could say that Walker is Robert Simpson's natural successor in his command of large organic structure juxtaposing vitality with stasis in the true sense of both words . Like Roussel , following two study visits to India he has drawn inspiration , particularly rhythmically , from the culture of that continent , and overall one senses a French provenance ( or as the composer himself puts it , a precession ) , matching the timeless strength of Varèse , Messiaen and , to my ears particularly , Koechlin . Remarkably Robin himself is not familiar with Koechlin , yet he aspires to the same fusion of energy and stillness ; listen to the opening of the second part of Dance / Still - for a moment , it could almost be from Le livre de la jongle . This comes across again awesomely in the organ work , Dances with Chant and Chorales , filtered through the prism of childhood recollection as a York Minster chorister of the grandeur of the Minster organ's Full Swell , and equally in the string quartet , I Thirst , with its clouds of natural harmonics . A further organ piece , Invention , takes as its starting point a very different French idiom , that of the virtuoso tradition of Dupré et al , not to mention Walker's first and much revered teacher at the Minster , Francis Jackson , whilst Halifax , written by contrast unusually and most effectively for the pianola , reveals an unexpected vein of Yorkshire humour beneath its celebration of a native heritage . Living as he now does just across the Pennines in Lancashire , it is no surprise that Walker has responded to another more recent virtuoso tradition , that established by the Manchester-based recorder player , John Turner , for whom he has written ten pieces ; two of these , stunningly played , are included on this CD . Readers of British Music volume 21 may recall Robin's account of how he grew up on the very road in York in which William Baines had lived and died at the age of 23 some thirty-odd years before . The spiritual affinity between these two composers of different eras goes far deeper than that simple coincidence , and the extended piano work , At the Grave of William Baines , is a direct response to a pilgrimage made to the grave on the 100th anniversary of Baines's birth . There is no superficial homage here replete with quotations - this is pure Robin Walker , albeit infused throughout with Baines's spirit , and the emotion is intense , filled with frustration , and ultimately resignation , at the waste of creative instincts thwarted by ill health . It is played magnificently by Peter Lawson . David Fanning calls Walker's half-hour symphonic poem The Stone Maker "" one of the outstanding achievements in British music of the 1990s "" , and , objectively setting aside my own Bainesian associations , I can not but think that the same applies to this piano work , at least as significant in the context of 1999 as was the impact of Baines's own Paradise Gardens exactly eighty years previously . Where next ? There are hopes of a recording of Walker's 40-part madrigal , recently broadcast by the Tallis Scholars on BBC Radio 3 , and meanwhile the world of opera beckons .

159	"We 're 25 , 26 years after the advent of the Macintosh , which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human-machine interface , and in computation in general . It fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation , thought about computers , how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them . It was such a radical change , in fact , that the early Macintosh development team in ' 82 , ' 83 , ' 84 , had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up . Now , this is an interesting little message , and it 's a lesson that has since , I think , been forgotten or lost or something . And that is , namely , that the OS is the interface . The interface is the OS . It 's like the land and the king ( i . e . Arthur ) they 're inseparable , they are one . And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter . It was n ' t just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines . There were no graphics routines . There were no mouse drivers . So it was a necessity . But in the quarter century since then , we 've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk . So memory capacity and disk capacity have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million . Same thing for processor speeds . Networks , we did n't have networks at all at the time of the Macintosh's introduction . And that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers . And , of course , graphics : today $ 84 . 97 at Best Buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago . So we 've got that incredible ramp-up . Then , on the side , we 've got the Web and , increasingly , the cloud , which is fantastic , but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental -- kind of a distraction . So we 've forgotten to invent new interfaces . Certainly we 've seen , in recent years , a lot of change in the regard . And people are starting to wake up about that . So what happens next ? Where do we go from there ? The problem , as we see it , has to do with a single , simple word , "" space "" or a single , simple phrase , "" real world geometry . "" Computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in , that we teach them in , are hideously insensate when it comes to space . They do n't understand real world space . It 's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well . They also do n't understand time , but that 's a matter for a separate talk . So what happens if you start to explain space to them ? One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room . The Luminous Room is a system in which it 's considered that input and output spaces are co-located . That 's a strangely simple , and yet unexplored idea , right ? When you use a mouse , your hand is down here on the mouse pad . It 's not even on the same plane as what you 're talking about : the pixels are up on the display . So here was a room in which all the walls , floors , ceilings , pets , potted plants , whatever was in there , were capable , not only , of display , but of sensing as well . And that means input and output are in the same space enabling stuff like this . That 's a digital storage in a physical container . The contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers . Has to come back out , whatever you put in . This little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well . If you presented it with a chess board , it tried to figure out what you might mean by that . And if there was nothing for them to do , the chess pieces eventually got bored and hopped away . The academics who were overseeing this work thought that was too frivolous , so we then built deadly serious applications like this optics prototyping workbench in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box becomes a laser . The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects , and the system projects down the laser beam path . So you 've got an interface that has no interface . You operate the world as you operate the real world , which is to say , with your hands . Similarly , a digital wind tunnel with digital wind flowing from right to left . Not that remarkable in a sense ; we did n't invent the mathematics . But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display , it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object , a real world object on it . Here , the real world merges with the simulation . And finally , to pull out all the stops , this is a system called Urp , for urban planners , in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use CAD systems . And we make the machine meet them half way . Urp projects down digital shadows , as you see here . And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock , then you can control the sun's position in the sky . That 's 8 : 00 AM shadows . They get a little shorter at 9 : 00 AM . There you are , swinging the sun around . Short shadows at noon and so forth . And we built up a series of tools like this . There are inter-shadowing studies that children can operate , even though they do n't know anything about urban planning , to move a building , you simply reach out your hand and you move the building . A material wand makes the building into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions . Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways ? A zoning tool connects distant structures , a building and a roadway . Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission ? and so forth . Now , if these ideas seem familiar or perhaps even a little dated , that 's great ; they should seem familiar . This work is 15 years old . This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab under the incredible direction of Prof. Hiroshi Ishii , director of the Tangible Media Group . And it was that work that was seen by Alex McDowell , one of the world's legendary production designers . Alex was preparing a little , sort of obscure , indie , arthouse film called "" Minority Report "" for Steven Spielberg , and invited us to come out from MIT and design the interfaces that would appear in that film . And the great thing about it was that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude , the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable , that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an R & D effort . And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual . People still reference those sequences in "" Minority Report "" when they talk about new UI design . So this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the Spatial Operating Environment , we call it . So here we have a bunch of stuff , some images . And , using a hand , we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom , six degrees of navigational control . And it 's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye . And you can come back out through the scary orangutan . And that 's all well and good . Let's do something a little more difficult . Here , we have a whole bunch of disparate images . We can fly around them . So navigation is a fundamental issue . You have to be able to navigate in 3D . Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial . And the part that is n't spatial can often be spatialized to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it . Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways . So we can throw it out like that . Let 's reset it . We can organize it this way . And , of course , it 's not just about navigation , but about manipulation as well . So if we do n't like something , or we 're intensely curious about Ernst Haeckel's scientific falsifications , we can pull them out like that . And then if it 's time for analysis , we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution . Let 's just come down a bit and fly around . So that 's a different way to look at stuff . If you 're of a more analytical nature then you might want , actually , to look at this as a color histogram . So now we 've got the stuff color-sorted , angle maps onto color . And now , if we want to select things , 3D , space , the idea that we 're tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in , not in 2D , not in fake 2D , but in actual 3D . Here are some selection planes . And we 'll perform this Boolean operation because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass . So , from there to the world of real work . Here 's a logistics system , a small piece of one that we 're currently building . There 're a lot of elements . And one thing that 's very important is to combine traditional tabular data with three-dimensional and geospatial information . So here 's a familiar place . And we 'll bring this back here for a second . Maybe select a little bit of that . And bring out this graph . And we should , now , be able to fly in here and have a closer look . These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States . One thing that three-dimensional interactions and the general idea of imbuing computation with space affords you is a final destruction of that unfortunate one to one pairing between human beings and computers . That 's the old way ; that 's the old mantra , one machine , one human , one mouse , one screen . Well , that does n ' t really cut it anymore . In the real world , we have people who collaborate ; we have people who have to work together . And we have many different displays . And we might want to look at these various images . We might want to ask for some help . The author of this new pointing device is sitting over there , so I can pull it from here to there . These are unrelated machines , right ? So the computation is space soluble and network soluble . So I 'm going to leave that over there because I have a question for Paul . Paul is the designer of the wand , and maybe its easiest for him to come over here and tell me in person what 's going on . So let me get some of these out of the way . Let 's pull this apart : I 'll go ahead and explode it . Kevin , can you help ? Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board . Mind you , it 's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise , but we do it in the lab all the time . All right . So collaborative work , whether it 's immediately co-located or distant and distinct , is always important . And again , that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space . And finally , I 'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery . This is a system called TAMPER , which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be . We at Oblong believe that media should be accessible in much more fine-grained form . So we have a large number of movies stuck inside here . And let 's just pick out a few elements . We can zip through them as a possibility . We can grab elements off the front , where upon they reanimate , come to life , and drag them down onto the table here . We 'll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well . We may need more than one . And we probably need , well , we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest . ( Laughter ) Yeah , let 's take that one . ( Laughter ) You see , cowboys and French farce people do n't go well together , and the system knows that . Let me leave with one final thought , and that is that one of the greatest English language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift . And he was n ' t talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 , or whether you have to spring 70 million bucks to buy the stolen Vermeer ; he was talking about the circumstances of its creation and of its existence . And I think that it 's time that we asked for the same from technology . Technology is capable of expressing and being imbued with a certain generosity , and we need to demand that , in fact . For some of this kind of technology , ground center is a combination of design , which is crucially important . We ca n ' t have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start . And , as well , of efficacy , agency . We 're , as human beings , the creatures that create , and we should make sure our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image . So I will leave you with that . Thank you . ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So to ask the obvious question -- actually this is from Bill Gates -- when ? ( John Underkoffler : When ? ) CA : When real ? When for us , not just in a lab and on a stage ? Can it be for every man , or is this just for corporations and movie producers ? JU : No , it has to be for every human being . That 's our goal entirely . We wo n ' t have succeeded unless we take that next big step . I mean it 's been 25 years . Can there really be only one interface ? There ca n ' t . CA : But does that mean that , at your desk or in your home , you need projectors , cameras ? You know , how can it work ? JU : No , this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display . It 'll be built into architecture . The gloves go away in a matter of months or years . So this is the inevitability about it . CA : So , in your mind , five years time , someone can buy this as part of a standard computer interface ? JU : I think in five years time when you buy a computer , you 'll get this . CA : Well that 's cool . ( Applause ) The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used . What do you think , what in your mind is the first killer app for this ? JU : That 's a good question , and we ask ourselves that every day . At the moment , our early-adopter customers -- and these systems are deployed out in the real world -- do all the big data intensive , data heavy problems with it . So , whether it 's logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction , financial services , pharmaceuticals , bioinformatics , those are the topics right now , but that 's not a killer app . And I understand what you 're asking . CA : C ' mon , c ' mon . Martial arts , games . C ' mon . ( Laughter ) John , thank you for making science-fiction real . JU : It 's been a great pleasure . Thank you to you all . ( Applause ) </content"	3

Check out some of the most-impressive physical features found in Africa . Congo River Coursing through the heart of Africa , the Congo is the continent's second longest river , after the Nile . It is contained primarily in , or marks the border of , the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The river is approximately 2,900 miles ( 4 , 700 km ) long and , with its many tributaries , forms the largest network of navigable waterways in Africa ; this is in spite of the difficulty in navigating the lower course of the river , which has 32 cataracts ( waterfalls ) . The Congo River is home to hundreds of species of fish , many of which are endemic to the river . There are few aquatic mammals in the river , but various types of reptiles , such as crocodiles , semiaquatic tortoises , and water snakes , reside there . Georg Gerster / Comstock Inc. The Sahara The Sahara , which takes its name from the Arabic word for "" desert , "" is the largest hot desert in the world . With a total approximate area of 3.32 million square miles ( 8 . 6 million square km ) , it encompasses almost all of northern Africa , spanning from the Atlantic Ocean on the western side of the continent to the Red Sea on the eastern side . About one-fourth of the Sahara's surface consists of sand sheets and dunes ; other principal features include sand seas , gravel-covered plains , rocky plateaus , abrupt mountains , shallow basins , and large oases . In general , vegetation in the Sahara is limited to areas around oases , wadis ( riverbeds that are usually dry outside the rainy season ) , and the highlands .

205	"Nineteenth session * Nairobi , 5 - 9 May 2003 Item 4 of the provisional agenda ** Activities of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme : progress report Report of the Executive Director Addendum World Summit on Sustainable Development Introduction The World Summit on Sustainable Development ( Johannesburg , 26 August - 4 September 2002 ) marked the culmination of a process that had started in early 2001 with progress reports prepared by United Nations system task managers on the implementation of Agenda 21 ( the reports were compiled by the end of 2001 into a formal report of the Secretary-General - Implementing Agenda 21 : E / CN . 17 / 2002 / PC . 2 / 7 ) and that had involved four meetings of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the Summit . The Summit itself which was presided by President T. Mbeki of South Africa , received 21,000 registered participants ( 9,000 government delegations including 104 heads of State and numerous ministers ; 8,000 representatives of intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations ; and 4,000 journalists ) and adopted two negotiated documents : ( a ) The Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development ; 1 ( b ) The Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development . 2 In addition to the plenary and negotiation sessions as well as the high-level round-table discussions , the Summit provided a framework for exhibitions and over 500 side and parallel events at various sites . General world opinion of the negotiated results of the Summit and its preparatory process ( type one outcomes ) was not very positive for the following reasons : The negotiated texts barely confirm previous agreements , and , with very few exceptions , do not commit Governments to new goals , targets and time frames ( one such rare exception is the target to halve the number of people without access to sanitation by 2015 , but this target is only a step forward from the related millennium development goal on drinking water , adopted two years ago ) ; There is general disappointment over the lack of implementation of Agenda 21 and related international agreements with calls for postponement of any future summits until Governments have demonstrated a willingness and ability to implement agreements already reached . There were some positive views of the Summit with regard to the awareness-raising on the social , economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and the broader involvement of both non-governmental organizations and the business community in partnerships with Governments and intergovernmental organizations through tangible implementation initiatives ( type two outcomes ) . Outcomes for the United Nations Human Settlements Programme The United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN-HABITAT ) , with its own special concerns and task-manager responsibilities for chapters 7 , 21 and 28 of Agenda 21 ( sustainable settlements , waste and sanitation , local authorities ) , has participated actively in the Summit process . Its normative and operational mandate is reflected in the type one outcome of the Summit ( negotiated text ) . The Plan of Implementation contains important references to UN-HABITAT's work in the sections on poverty eradication , changing unsustainable patterns of consumption and production , protecting and managing the natural resource base of economic and social development , sustainable development in Africa , means of implementation , and institutional framework for sustainable development . The following commitments expressed in the Plan are of special interest : Halve the number of people without access to drinking water and sanitation by 2015 ( paragraph 7 ( a )) ; Improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers by 2020 , with respect to land , adequate shelter and the role of local authorities ( paragraph 11 ) ; Support African countries in their efforts to implement the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , in the areas of sustainable urbanization , adequate shelter , basic services , governance systems in cities and other human settlements , and national or local institutional capacities ( paragraph 71 ) ; Strengthen UN-HABITAT ( jointly with the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in its role to build capacities at all levels for implementing Agenda 21 ; Enhance the role of local authorities and partnerships involving local authorities and other levels of government as called for in the Habitat Agenda ( Paragraph 167 ) . Furthermore , there are numerous other references relevant to UN-HABITAT's work , including the following : transport ( para . 21 ) ; waste management ( para . 22 ) ; water resource management ( paras . 26 and 28 ) ; coastal area management and land-based marine pollution ( paras . 30 and 32 ) ; disaster management ( paras . 37 and 64 ) ; lead pollution ( para . 7 ) ; capacity-building in the geographic information system , indicators , planning and management methodologies ( para . 136 ) ; and good governance and broad-based decision-making ( paras . 138 and 141 ) . The Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development is a political statement agreed at the highest level and is not meant to repeat the much more detailed Plan of Implementation . However , even at this general policy level , the Declaration contains explicit reference to UN-HABITAT's areas of responsibility , placing them at the top of the agenda , effectively updating the water and sanitation , energy , health , agriculture and biodiversity ( WEHAB ) list of priorities : "" 18 . We welcome the focus of the Johannesburg Summit on the indivisibility of human dignity and are resolved , through decisions on targets , timetables and partnerships , to speedily increase access to such basic requirements as clean water , sanitation , adequate shelter , energy , health care , food security and the protection of biodiversity . "" The responsibilities of UN-HABITAT are also well reflected in the type two outcome of the Summit ( partnership implementation commitments ) . The Coalition for Sustainable Urbanization , developed by UN-HABITAT with more than 40 Habitat Agenda partners and posted on the official World Summit web site , was formally announced by the Executive Director in her plenary address , and was launched in a half-day "" corporate event "" involving the full range of partners . The Coalition has been praised by partners as a coherent cluster of mutually supportive initiatives linked by the common conceptual framework of sustainable urbanization . At the same time , individual components of the Coalition for Sustainable Urbanization have gained prominence in their own rights . Among them , and most importantly , the Water for Asian Cities partnership between UN-HABITAT , the Asian Development Bank , the Government of the Netherlands , and Governments of Asian countries , has received much attention . With its agreed $ 10 million in grants and $ 500 million in fast-track credit , the initiative is expected to demonstrate the complementarity between capacity-building and lending operations , between the United Nations and development finance institutions . Other noteworthy components of the Coalition for Sustainable Urbanization include close operational partnerships with global associations of local authorities ( individual or through the World Association of Cities and Local Authorities Coordination - WACLAC ) for strengthening local capacities for sustainable urbanization . These partnerships , also involving partner organizations such as UNEP , the United Nations Institute for Training and Research ( UNITAR ) , the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , the United Nations Volunteers ( UNV ) programme and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , focus on thematic issues such as HIV-AIDS , or on modalities for capacity development such as demonstration and replication , training , best practices , and city-to-city cooperation . Prominent among these partnerships is the next phase of the Sustainable Cities Programme with funding from the Government of the Netherlands and the Partnership for Local Capacity Development a result of joint work on city-to-city cooperation in which the international associations of local authorities place high expectations . Activities of UN-HABITAT in Johannesburg A focused and coherent message was prepared and agreed with Habitat Agenda partners from the beginning of UN-HABITAT's preparations for the Summit in early 2002 . This message was consistently promoted by all . It has the following two dimensions that parallel the two types of interrelated outcomes expected from the overall Summit process ( i . e . , type one , negotiated norms and policies ; and type two , partnership implementation commitments ) : Sustainable urbanization ( policy framework ) : There will be no sustainable development without sustainable urbanization Local capacities are key for sustainable urbanization . Coalition for Sustainable Urbanization ( 11 partnership implementation commitments ) : Millennium Cities Partnership Developing Local Capacities for Global Agendas Partnership for Local Capacity Development Model City-to-City Cooperation Partnerships Demonstrating Local Environmental Planning and Management National Capacities for Upscaling Local Agenda 21 Demonstrations Local Capacity-building and Training for Sustainable Urbanization Learning From Best Practices , Good Policies and Enabling Legislation in Support of Sustainable Urbanization Water for Asian Cities Partnership for Sustainable African Cities Partnership for Managing HIV / AIDS at the Local Level . Over the preparatory period , UN-HABITAT and its partners were relatively successful in ensuring that the key messages on sustainable urbanization and the key thematic areas addressed by the Coalition for Sustainable Urbanization would be reflected in the negotiated text of the Summit . This political work resulted in the UN-HABITAT related text mentioned in section A above , and was completed by the end of the fourth session of the preparatory committee in Bali . The remaining negotiations held in Johannesburg did not for the most part deal with text directly related to the mandate of UN-HABITAT - with the important exception of the political declaration , which was drafted from scratch in Johannesburg . The extraordinary achievement of getting "" adequate shelter "" mentioned as a priority concern in the Johannesburg Declaration was due to the constructive relationship between the Executive Director and her team , members of the Committee of Permanent Representatives to UN-HABITAT and concerned government representatives . During the 10 days of the World Summit itself , the work of the UN-HABITAT secretariat focused primarily on delivering the UN-HABITAT message and making best use of a variety of special opportunities presented by the Summit . These opportunities included plenary statements by the Executive Director , side and parallel events organized by UN-HABITAT , events organized by UN-HABITAT partners , press conferences , book launches , exhibitions , bilateral meetings , etc. Those events included the following : The Executive Director addressed close to 20 events during the 10-day Summit . This included two statements in the plenary and participation in a - level round table with Heads of State ; The Executive Director gave two official press briefings and close to 20 one-on-one interviews ; UN-HABITAT organized with various partners a dozen side and parallel events including : A "" corporate event "" on the Coalition for Sustainable Urbanization ; A partnership event on Sustainable African Cities ; Several partnership events on Water for Cities ; A meeting of the United Nations Advisory Committee of Local Authorities ( UNACLA ) ; UN-HABITAT organized a major exhibition on water and sanitation ; UN-HABITAT launched three publications : Sustainable Urbanization : Achieving Agenda 21 ( based on the outcome of the first World Urban Forum , in cooperation with the British Department for International Development ( DFID ) , providing the unifying framework for the Coalition , 1000 copies distributed in Johannesburg and 2000 copies distributed worldwide ) ; Coalition for Sustainable Urbanization : Partnership Commitments for Implementing Agenda 21 ( prepared with more than 40 Habitat Agenda partners , following the first World Urban Forum , 500 copies distributed at the Summit , 500 copies distributed worldwide ) ; Sustainable Urbanization : Bridging the Brown and the Green Agendas ( 260 pages , in cooperation with DFID and the Development Planning Unit ) ; UN-HABITAT staff participated in various roles - chairperson , keynote speaker or speaker - in numerous events organized by partners such as the following : Several meetings held in the context of the local government session organized by the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives ( ICLEI ) ; An event organized by the Global Lead Network ; An official side event organized by UNITAR ; and A WHO launch of the "" Healthy Environment for Children "" programme . C. Follow-up Only time will tell whether the World Summit has been a real success . As far as UN-HABITAT is concerned , initial assessment indicates that the Habitat Agenda has fared quite well in the Summit process , considering the generally acknowledged limitations of this process . UN-HABITAT made good use of the worldwide momentum created by the process , the worldwide sense of urgency of the need to address sustainable development in all its dimensions , and the heightened spirit of partnership that emerged . Accordingly , UN-HABITAT and its partners successfully used the process to make significant progress in three areas : There is sharper focus on what must be done in human settlement policies to achieve sustainable development . This has resulted in the policy framework of sustainable urbanization developed , agreed , published , and applied to partnership implementation agreements ; There has been a building of awareness of the important role of cities and other human settlements for sustainable development . This has resulted in enhanced recognition of the issue globally and among Habitat Agenda partners who are using sustainable urbanization as a unifying framework for joint normative and operational activities ; The momentum , heightened interest in sustainable development and partnership spirit have led to the development of implementation initiatives , complete with concrete work plans , agreed responsibilities and funding commitments . This has resulted in the Coalition for Sustainable Urbanization and its component initiatives ( e . g . , the Water for Asian Cities programme ) . UN-HABITAT's participation in the World Summit was in keeping with the plan developed , refined and implemented over the eight months preparatory period in the context of close and systematic collaboration among UN-HABITAT's senior management and professional staff , the Committee of Permanent Representatives to UN-HABITAT , and the full range of Habitat Agenda partners . Follow-up , in broad terms , is part of a similar broad based plan with three basic components : Follow-up on the Summit's political outcome for UN-HABITAT , especially the recognition of "" adequate shelter "" as a thematic priority and "" framework for action "" at par with the other WEHAB areas ( paragraph 18 of the Johannesburg Declaration ) ; Administrative and managerial follow-up to enable UN-HABITAT fulfil its Summit mandates and commitments , especially with respect to institutional structures and capacities ; and Operational follow-up , including the further development and implementation of the Coalition for Sustainable Urbanization and its component initiatives . With regard to the political follow-up , the outcome of the Summit was reported to the UN-HABITAT Committee of Permanent Representatives one week after the Johannesburg event . The Committee in turn communicated to the Permanent Representatives in New York the significance of including , in paragraph 18 of the political declaration , adequate shelter alongside the other WEHAB thematic priority areas . In its communication , the Committee suggested specific language for all General Assembly resolutions on UN-HABITAT that would ensure recognition of the importance of urbanization issues such as adequate shelter , water and sanitation for the achievement of sustainable development . The Executive Director also took up the issue in her speech to the fifty seventh session of the General Assembly on UN-HABITAT and the secretariat addressed the issue in the Summit follow-up arrangements and mechanisms such as the open-ended working group established by the High-level Committee on Programmes and the task group formed within the programme group of the United Nations Development Group ( UNDG ) . Further , UN-HABITAT has used the Summit outcome to update its work under the millennium development goals , such as Target 10 on sustainable access to drinking water . With regard to the administrative and managerial follow-up , to facilitate UN-HABITAT's Summit mandates and commitments , the Executive Director has taken important decisions , including the following : Signing of a memorandum of understanding with UNDP to place UN-HABITAT officers in UNDP country offices to ensure that issues of slum upgrading , adequate shelter and sustainable urbanization will be better incorporated and coordinated in macro-economic planning and local investment frameworks such as the poverty reduction strategy papers and the country development frameworks ; Establishment of a new subprogramme in the UN-HABITAT work programme to revive the Habitat and Human Settlements Foundation as per General Assembly resolution 56 / 206 of 21 December 2001 . Donors have provided grants to support preparatory activities ; Establishment of a fully fledged Water , Sanitation and Infrastructure Branch , with eight professionals , to rise to the challenge of delivering the water and sanitation targets agreed in Johannesburg ; Creation of a Water and Sanitation Trust Fund , with an initial UN-HABITAT investment of $ 1 million , to make available funds that can be quickly disbursed in the area of water and sanitation . With regard to the operational follow-up , the component initiatives of the Coalition for Sustainable Urbanization are being developed further and implemented . New partners and new initiatives are joining the Coalition . Synergy and cohesion under the unifying framework of Sustainable Urbanization will be reviewed in the context of the World Urban Forum . Through this the concept of Sustainable Urbanization is being further developed enabling UN-HABITAT and its partners to enhance over time their important contribution to socially , economically , and environmentally sustainable development . Set out below are some examples : Developing Local Capacities for Global Agendas - UN-HABITAT and UNEP are continuing to develop local capacities for a two-way link between local development priorities and opportunities , and the global norms established in UN-HABITAT's global campaigns ( e . g . , participation , accountability , security ) and UNEP's environmental conventions ( e . g . climate change , land-based marine pollution , biodiversity ) . Strategies are being developed with the international local government community ( through WACLAC and UNACLA ) in international meetings such as the World Urban Forum and the annual partners meeting of the Sustainable Cities Programme ; Partnership for Local Capacity Development - This partnership implementation commitment is the primary joint instrument of UN-HABITAT and the international local government community ( through WACLAC and UNACLA ) to promote local capacity development . It builds on the joint achievements in city-to-city cooperation in response to resolutions 18 / 10 and 18 / 11 of the Commission on Human Settlements that were endorsed at the special session of the General Assembly for an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , the World Urban Forum and the local government session of the World Summit . City-to-city cooperation was the theme of the 2002 World Habitat Day and will be addressed at the nineteenth Governing Council in the context of dialogue on decentralization and local authorities development ; Demonstrating Local Environmental Planning and Management - Major donors are now committed to supporting the new phase of the joint UN-HABITAT / UNEP Sustainable Cities Programme , designed to broaden environmental planning and management demonstrations undertaken by local authorities and their local partners . Through expanded and more systematic collaboration with related international initiatives such as the UNDP Public-Private Partnership for the Urban Environment and the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) Advisory Support Information Services and Training , the Programme is addressing new issues such as sustainable mobility and improved basic urban services for the poor and marginalized groups ; National Capacities for Upscaling Local Agenda 21 Demonstrations - Based on the large number of joint local Agenda 21 demonstrations , UN-HABITAT and UNEP are now documenting lessons of experience in collaboration with local and central governments and national urban training institutions . This is aimed at building national capacities for effectively replicating the demonstration activities and for multiplying the positive impact of the investments made in connection with these demonstrations ; Learning from Best Practices , Good Policies and Enabling Legislation in Support of Sustainable Urbanzation - Two new partners have joined this partnership , ComHabitat and the Universal Forum of Cultures - Barcelona 2004 . ComHabitat increases the outreach of the partnership to policy makers and grassroots leaders in 54 Commonwealth countries while the Universal Forum on Cultures - Barcelona 2004 help identify and document new practices and emerging policy responses , offering new opportunities for bringing lessons learned to the attention of the general public ; Water for Asian Cities - This partnership will be launched in March 2003 in Osaka ; Partnership for Sustainable African Cities - This partnership promotes the sharing of experience and know-how for broad-based planning and management of African cities . Following its launch at the World Summit , sustainable urbanization has been included in the New Partnership for African Development ( NEPAD ) with UN-HABITAT as the task manager . A concrete follow-up to the Johannesburg commitments at the national level was the launch of the South Africa Cities Network , on the 2002 World Habitat Day . To further operationalize the programme , preparations are underway to convene a ministerial meeting during the nineteenth Governing Council ; Partnership for Managing HIV / AIDS at the Local Level - Adequate shelter for HIV / AIDS orphans is being promoted by a Rockefeller Foundation - UN-HABITAT partnership . UNDP and UN-HABITAT have launched a new Urban Management Programme partnership on HIV / AIDS in eight selected cities throughout the world . There is also a new partnership with SAfAIDS ( Southern Africa AIDS Information and Dissemination Services , Harare ) in Blantyre , Malawi , and with UN-AMICAALL ( Alliance of Mayors Initiatives for Community Action on Aids at the Local Level ) for the launch of national chapters of the Alliance of Mayors on HIV / AIDS in Kenya and Malawi ; Weihai Conference on Sustainable Urbanization Strategies - This initiative of UN-HABITAT , the Chinese Ministry of Construction and the city of Weihai is a direct follow-up to the Summit and will support international exchange of experiences on sustainable urbanization strategies , including the implementation of the Water for Asian cities programme . It will take place in September 2003 ; Future meetings of the World Urban Forum in Europe , America and Asia - The World Urban Forum has an important role to play in the follow-up to the Summit by reviewing progress of the partnership initiatives and ensuring synergy and cohesion under the unifying framework of Sustainable urbanization . The World Urban Forum will be held once every two years . The first meeting of the Forum was held in Africa ( Nairobi , 2002 ) , the second will be held in Europe ( Barcelona , 2004 ) , the third in America ( Vancouver , 2006 ) , and discussions are under way for holding the fourth in Asia . * In its resolution 56 / 206 of 21 December 2001 , the General Assembly transformed the Commission on Human Settlements into the Governing Council of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN-HABITAT ) , a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly . This session has been designated as the nineteenth instead of the first session of the Governing Council to signify the continuity and relationship between the Governing Council and the Commission on Human Settlements .

1380	"The number and diversity of threats within the past decade have created the need to pay closer attention to the safety of our educational institutions . Rampage shootings at Virginia Tech Univ. , Blacksburg , and Northern Illinois Univ. , DeKalb ; explosions from a chemical spill at Georgia Tech Univ. , Atlanta ; a bomb at the Univ. of Oklahoma , Norman ; and the devastation from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on Gulf Coast campuses , have driven home the vulnerability of our educational institutions . Schools must be ready to enhance campus preparedness for catastrophic events , from weather-related incidents to terrorism . Code compliance Not only are campus officials concerned about protecting their campuses from today's complex threats , but also about complying with new government mandates and codes . Enforced by the Dept. of Education , Washington , universities and colleges must comply with the Clery Act , which requires timely warnings to the campus community about crimes that pose an ongoing threat to students and employees . In addition , the U.S. House of Representatives passed The College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2008 , which requires colleges and universities to issue public warnings within 30 min . of an emergency . This bill is currently being reviewed by the Senate . Several governing bodies , such as the Dept. of Defense , Washington ; Dept. of Homeland Security , Washington ; and the National Fire Protection Association , Quincy , MA , have already adopted warning-system codes and requirements . Mass Notification Systems , or MNS , are defined as life-safety systems designed to alert and protect people in an emergency . They provide real-time information to people in a building , area , or site through recorded and live voice messages , as well as direction through visual signals . While campus security professionals and administrators struggle with the "" how "" and the "" what "" to communicate , campus facilities' managers and IT administrators focus on how to build the MNS . They study which MNS technologies are available to get the message out , how these technologies can be implemented and integrated with existing infrastructure and communication systems , and where the equipment and systems should be installed . Voice to text According to a report from the Univ. of California Campus Security Task Force , Oakland , CA , released in January 2008 , "" Emergency notification systems should be both layered and redundant-no single means of communication should be solely relied upon to reach the entire campus community . "" From hearing specific voice announcements on campus outdoor loudspeakers , to students receiving emergency text messages on cell phones , school administrators recognize that to effectively communicate in a timely manner , multiple communication solutions should be used , depending on the type of emergency and the campus environment . For example , campus safety experts know that e-mail ca n't reach people on athletic fields , or in classes where professors require students to silence their cell phones . To reach both of these areas , an indoor notification system and an outdoor voice-based warning system would be the most efficient and effective way to alert students or those in the area . According to the Blueprint for Safer Campuses , published by the Int ' l Assn. of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators , West Hartford , CT , communications can consist of the following layers : The MNS should be customized to meet the needs of the individual campus . It should be a modular and scalable system that is easily expanded in phases , by leveraging existing systems . Administrators can build the system one layer at a time , starting with an outdoor system or with an emergency text alerting system , and then add more layers as funds are available . The MNS should allow administrators to alert and inform people in multiple areas , using multiple languages with changing instructions , broadcast to a single floor of a building or to an entire campus , and also to send messages to multiple , geographically separated campuses for regional control . These systems must meet multiple safety industry codes and standards , including the NFPA 72-Annex E , OSHA 1910 . 165-Employee Alarm Systems , the Americans with Disabilities Act , and SAFETY Act Certification , providing legal liability protection for the university in the event of a terrorist attack . Control unit-an integrated base station that transmits emergency announcements as prerecorded or live ( microphone ) messages to any individual or group of audible devices on a campus , as well as sending commands to activate visual-notification appliances . A control unit continuously monitors the status of all radio transceivers and their associated audible and visual notification devices . Web-based emergency communication-text - and voice-messaging systems can alert tens of thousands of students , faculty , and staff . Alerts can be sent simultaneously to multiple devices , including e-mail addresses , cell phones , pagers , and other wireless devices . This dramatically increases the likelihood each student will receive the message , no matter where or when an emergency occurs . Due to possible grid power loss , all MNS components should be protected with battery back up . Other power options , which include solar panels and generators , should be considered to allow alerts to continue without interruption . With a personal alerting system , such as emergency text alerting , the system should be secured with a redundant data center . Campus administrators should be able to remotely activate critical MNS functions from a cell phone or laptop . If the primary command center were destroyed , a fixed or mobile secondary station should be set up to control the system . For improved system management and situation awareness , an MNS should be integrated directly with other command systems , and other life-safety and security systems such as chemical - and intrusion-detection systems and fire-alarm panels . MNS at work Longwood Univ. , Farmville , VA , has nearly 5,000 enrolled students , with 70 % of undergraduates living on campus . With more than 800 full - and part-time faculty , the university has 50 buildings on a 60-acre campus , and 32 off-campus buildings . Longwood Univ. officials relied on emergency contact "" phone trees "" for internal communications , and media outlets for external communications . Students outdoors or off campus could not be notified within seconds of a disaster or power outage . "" The events at Virginia Tech and other schools across the country have demonstrated the necessity to create redundant effective systems that provide information among many pathways , "" said Dan Dillon , Longwood University's emergency-management director . An MNS solution from Cooper Notification , Long Branch , NJ , that includes outdoor warning systems , emergency text messaging , and e-mail alerts , enables officials at Longwood Univ. to alert the campus community in real time , during events such as a tornado or police emergency , and offers protection for the entire campus . The university has installed six WAVES ( wireless audio-visual emergency system ) with HPSAs at highly populated on - and off-campus locations for exterior voice alerting . In an emergency , the HPSAs will broadcast a siren alert , followed by a live or recorded voice message tailored to the situation . The intrusive system has the ability to alert the entire campus or individual areas , depending on the scope of the emergency . In addition , the university has a roam secure alert network ( RSAN ) personal alerting system , also from manufacturer Cooper Notification . Known on campus as Alert Longwood , the system sends emergency text messages to students on their cell phones and e-mail to their university e-mail accounts . Cooper Notification's MNS has been successfully tested in military applications . Additionally , the WAVES outdoor warning system can be integrated into the RSAN platform for a one-system solution . System features include the ability to deliver clear , audible voice alerts to the outdoor population ; to operate on its own network , not relying on the college's infrastructure in the event of a power outage ; and to activate the system quickly and easily . A campus is a growing , evolving community . It is necessary to regularly test and evaluate the MNS , including its subsystems and procedures . The potential for disaster in a college community always exists . But the severity of events-whether natural or manmade-can be curtailed through proper application of a good mass notification system . Authors"	4
899	"DES BUYS A NEW SHED "" I 've come to a major decision , "" announced Des one morning in the cafe . "" I ca n't put it off any longer . "" "" Oh thank goodness , "" said Mick . "" Yes , it 's been something of an embarrassment for ages , "" said Des . "" So the time has now come to splash out and buy a brand new one ! "" "" You 're joking ?! "" exclaimed Clive . "" Have you finally come to your senses ?! "" "" Yep , "" said Des . "" I 'm going to get a really nifty top-of-the-range model ! "" "" Fantastic ! "" said Clive . "" Maybe this will mean house prices will finally be on the rise round here ! "" "" Why are you always so bothered about house prices ? "" said Mick . "" Because when my house finally reaches a reasonable price I 'll be able to sell it and leave you bunch of muppets behind forever !! "" said Clive . Just then Mike the Manic Mechanic walked in . "" Hey Mike , great news , Des is finally going to buy a new car ! "" said Clive . "" Brilliant Des , about time too ! "" said Mike . "" Now I 've got some fantastic deals on at the moment , how do you fancy a brand new used 1983 Fiesta XR2 with a mere 4000 totally genuine honest guv miles on the clock and a sunroof ! "" Just then Mrs Greasy came out with their lunch . "" Oh my goodness , look at the time ! "" said Clive suddenly . "" I 'm due at the squash club !! "" He got up and dashed out of the café . "" No , no , Mike , I 'm not buying a new car !! "" said Des . "" Clive misunderstood what I was talking about !! What would I want to buy a new car for , I could never sell my beloved Fiat 126 !! "" "" Darn , "" said Mike . "" I was talking about my snowdome ! "" said Des . "" Look at it , it does n't even work any more ! "" He took his snowdome out of his pocket , shook it , and nothing happened . "" Well it is summer , you do n't get snow in the summer , "" pointed out Mike . "" Oh yes , and I 'm getting a new shed as well , "" said Des . "" But first I must clear out the old one . "" After having to endure Mrs Greasy's lunch , Des went back to his house and down his garden to begin clearing out his shed . Mick came along as well since he evidently had nothing better to do . "" Good grief , you need a new shed more than you need a new snowdome ! "" said Mick . They looked at the shed – the walls were all leaning inwards , there was no glass in the window frames and there were numerous holes in the canvas roof . "" Okay , you open the door , "" said Des . "" Why me ? "" said Mick . "" Well ... I have n't been in there for about ten years , "" said Des . "" I 'm afraid that if I open the door the whole thing might just collapse ! "" "" Well I 'm not opening it !! "" said Mick . "" Do you think I 'm mad ?! "" "" Let 's find someone else to do it then , "" said Des . "" Like Clive ! "" "" But he 's gone down the squash club ! "" said Mick . "" No he 's not , he 's over there in his garden ! "" said Des . Clive was sitting on his garden , sipping an ice cold drink , as it was quite a warm day . Des and Mick walked across to the fence and peered over at him . "" What do you want ?! "" snapped Clive . "" Ca n't you see I 'm busy !! "" "" You 're supposed to be at the squash club ! "" said Mick . "" I am ! The orange squash club ! Membership of one ! And I 'd like it to stay that way !! "" "" We were just wondering if you could come and open my shed door , "" said Des . "" Are you mad , I 'm not going in that rickety old thing ! "" said Clive . "" And that 's final ! "" "" Um ... I 've got some rare vinyl Bee Gees albums in there ! "" said Des . Immediately Clive put his drink down , walked over the fence , straight across Des's garden and opened the shed door . He walked inside the shed and started searching for the Bee Gees records . "" Oh , "" said Des , slightly disappointed to see that the shed had not collapsed around Clive's ears . "" See Mick , perfectly safe ! "" "" Where are these records then ?! "" said Clive . "" Umm , well actually I have n't really ... "" said Des . "" Oh here they are ! "" said Clive , picking up a box in the corner . "" Cor , there 's some classic stuff here ! Thanks Des !! "" Clive walked out of the shed carrying the box of Bee Gees records while Des looked on in amazement . "" You 're not a secret Bee Gees fan are you ?! "" said Mick . "" No I 'm not , it 's so long since I 've been in that shed I 've no idea what 's in there ! "" said Des . "" Anyway , Clive has proved it 's perfectly safe to go in there , come on ! "" "" Hmmm , I think I 'll just hang around outside , it 's quite a nice day today ! "" said Mick . "" Suit yourself , "" said Des . He went inside the shed and started searching through piles of stuff . Before long the contents of the shed were piling up outside . Other than the usual garden equipment , they included a moose's head , an old gramophone , a model skeleton , a birdcage , a trilby , ten garden gnomes , an old cooker , a rocking horse , some flying ducks , and a massive poster of Bob Carolgees and Spit the Dog . As Mick looked on , he kept expecting the shed to come crashing down at any minute , but remarkably it still managed to stay up . After an hour or so , Des had finally finished clearing it out , and he and Mick looked round at all the junk that had taken over Des's garden . "" Did all that stuff really fit inside that small shed ?! "" said Mick . "" Certainly did ! "" said Des . The shed now looked even more precarious now everything had been cleared out . Mick peered inside and saw there was still one thing left inside - a rake that was leaning against the wall . "" Oi Des , that 's my rake , I always wondered what happened to that !! "" exclaimed Mick . "" Is it ? "" said Des . "" Oh no , I would n't ... "" Mick strode inside and claimed his rake . Immediately the wall collapsed inwards . Mick tried to dart out the way , but then the other walls began to fall inwards . Mick went through an empty window frame , and then right through the canvas roof as it crashed down . He was left standing there with his rake , covered in dust , in the middle of the remains of the shed . "" Oh Mick , that rake was the only thing holding the shed up ! "" said Des , who was stood well back . "" Was it really ?!?! "" exclaimed Mick . "" At least it saves taking it apart ! "" said Des . "" Oi you lot , keep the noise down , I 've trying to enjoy a peaceful sit in the garden !! "" shouted Clive . "" Hey Clive , you do n't want a moose's head , do you ? "" said Des . "" Oh , you 've got one already ! Ha !! "" Clive snarled . "" Seriously though , is there anything you do want ? "" said Des . "" Poster of Bob Carolgees ? I can see you 're tempted ! "" "" No ! "" said Clive . "" What about you , Mick ? "" said Des . "" I do n't want a poster of him either ! "" said Clive . "" That 's just a pile of ridiculous old junk ! "" said Mick , who was busy wiping the dust off himself . "" Why do n't you just get rid of it all !! "" "" Naaah ! "" said Des . "" Might be worth something one day ! "" Des cleared the bits of the shed out of the way . Next came the big purchase – a brand new shed ! But first of all Des had to go and quickly buy his new snowdome . Then he went to the garden centre , with Mick tagging along . "" What a vast selection of sheds on offer ! "" said Mick , looking at the vast selection of sheds on offer . They were located outside the garden centre itself , in an area adjacent to the car park . "" I 'll have that one , "" said Des , pointing at the first shed he saw . "" Are n't you going to have a look around ? "" said Mick . "" See what else is on offer ? Perhaps buy a copy of ' Which Shed ' ? That 's what I did ! "" "" You would , "" said Des . "" Look at them , they 're all the same ! I 'll have this one , looks good enough to me ! "" Des handed over the cash to the sales assistant , and the shed was now in Des's possession . "" Now the only problem is ... "" said Des . "" How am I going to get it home ? "" He tried lifting it , without much success , obviously . "" Could n't you just get the garden centre to deliver it ? "" said Mick . Just then Mike the Manic Mechanic came up to them , carrying a large garden gnome . "" Oh hi there Des and Mick , "" said Mike . They looked at his gnome . "" Oh no , it 's not for me , it 's for my Aunty Mavis's birthday . I do n't like her , so I thought she 'd hate this ! Is that your new shed ? "" Des stared hard at the shed for several seconds . "" You know what Mike , I think it is ! "" said Des . "" Thanks for pointing it out ! "" "" No problem , "" said Mike . "" Actually , I have got a bit of a problem , "" said Des . "" I know that , "" said Mike . "" How am I going to get this shed home ? "" said Des . "" Could you perhaps ... "" "" The answer is obvious !! "" exclaimed Mike . "" Bring round your car ! "" Des drove round his car from the car park . When he got out , Mike started taking off the wheels . "" Mike , what are you doing ?! "" exclaimed Des . "" Simple ! "" said Mike . "" I 'm going to transfer the wheels , engine , chassis and steering column from your car onto this shed . Then you can drive it home !! "" "" Riiiight , "" said Mick . Des was a bit unsure about this idea , but since Mike had already started the process he did n't like to interrupt . "" Erm Mike , this wo n't take long , will it ? "" said Des . "" Naaah , three or four hours should do it !! "" said Mike . "" Okay ... "" said Des . "" And then when we get it home , I 'll transfer everything back onto your car and it 'll be as good as new ! "" said Mike . "" Unless you 'd like to pop round to my garage and choose a classy little number from my selection of hot Fords ! "" "" No thanks , "" said Des . They watched as Mike busily took the body of Des's Fiat 126 away from the chassis . "" I ca n't help thinking there must have been a simpler way to get that shed home , "" sighed Des . "" Like asking the garden centre to deliver it ? "" said Mick . "" Or asking Mike to deliver it on a pick-up or something ? "" "" What 's that , Mick ? "" said Mike . "" Oh nothing , nothing , "" said Mick . After about five hours Mike had finally finished . The shed now had wheels , lights , an engine , a chassis , a steering wheel , bumpers and number plates , all donated by Des's Fiat 126 . As the floorpan was taken from the Fiat , the engine had to be placed at the rear of the shed . At the front Mike had removed the door from its hinges , and plonked a seat there . Bolted onto the front was the steering column , pedals and a load of wires . "" Whaddya think !! "" said Mike . "" Pretty nifty , eh ! "" "" Super , "" mumbled Mick . "" Just one thing , "" said Des . "" How am I going to get my car home ? "" He pointed at the shell of his Fiat . "" Umm ... "" said Mike . "" Ca n't you ask the garden centre to deliver it ? "" "" Too late , the garden centre 's closed ! "" exclaimed Mick . "" It 's starting to get dark ! "" "" I know what to do ! "" said Mike . "" I reckon your car 's just small enough ! "" Mike set about removing one of the side walls of the shed . "" Good grief , "" sighed Mick . Mike , Des and Mick heaved the shell of the car inside the shed , and Mike replaced the wall . "" There ! "" said Mike . "" Now all you have to do is drive it home ! "" "" Thank goodness it 's getting dark , hopefully no one will see me ! "" said Des . He carefully went and sat down on the seat at the front of the shed . "" It should drive just like your Fiat ! "" said Mike . "" In other words , terribly ! "" "" Are you sure it 's road legal ? "" said Des . "" Course it is , you 've got lights , seat belt , number plates , tax disc ! "" said Mike . "" What more do you want , an MOT document ?! "" "" Umm ... "" said Des . "" Just start the engine !! "" exclaimed Mike . Des did so , and the familiar rumble of the Fiat 126 engine was heard . "" I 'll give you a lift home , Mick , "" said Mike . "" Thanks Mike , I would n't be seen dead in a thing like that ! "" said Mick . "" Too right , nor me !! "" said Mike . They watched as Des put his foot on the accelerator pedal , and the shed began to trundle through the car park . "" ' Ere Mike , is this as fast as it will go ?! "" shouted Des . Because the shell of his Fiat 126 was weighing the shed down , Des was finding that the engine barely had enough power to propel the shed along at any great speed . "" Sorry Des , not a lot I can do about that !! "" shouted back Mike . "" I 'll see you in the morning to put your car back together again !! "" Mick and Mike whizzed off home in Mike's Cortina , while Des was left trailing in his motorised shed . "" He could at least have put a turbocharger in , "" grumbled Des . Des trundled along the road at a speed that would make a milk float look fast . "" I hope PC Plod's in bed ! "" thought Des . "" I 'm not sure if this is exactly legal ! "" Unfortunately he was n't . Des soon noticed Plod riding behind him on his bike . It did n't take long for Plod to catch him up . "" Excuse me sir , may I have a quick word with you ? "" said Plod . "" Oh no come on , no way was I exceeding the speed limit this time ! "" exclaimed Des . "" Is this your , erm , vehicle , sir ? "" asked Plod . "" Well ... yeeees ... but ... "" said Des . "" Have you a vehicle registration certificate ? "" said Plod . "" It does n't exactly look roadworthy to me . "" "" Oh yes it is , it 's passed its MOT and everything ! "" said Des . "" Can I see your vehicle registration certificate please ? "" asked Plod . "" Err ... tell you what , I have n't got it on me at the moment , so come round my house tomorrow and I 'll show it to you then ! "" "" Right you are , sir , "" said Plod . "" I 'll see you tomorrow . "" He raced off on his bicycle to continue fighting crime . Des decided he would deal with the problem in the morning . When he finally arrived home , as it was now getting very late , he decided to leave the shed parked in the front drive overnight , and hoped no one would steal it ( yeah right , as if anyone 's going to steal a motorised shed ) . The next morning , when Des got up , he looked out of the window and was surprised to see Clive looking at his new shed , weeping . He went outside to see him . "" Clive , what 's the matter ? "" said Des . "" Why me ?! "" moaned Clive . "" Why me ?!?!? "" "" What are you talking about ?! "" said Des . "" Of all the millions of people on this planet , why did I have to end up with you as my neighbour ?!?! "" "" I do n't know what you mean ! "" said Des . "" You ca n't do anything sensible , can you ?! "" exclaimed Clive . "" All you had to do was to buy a new car !! But no , you have to go and buy a shed on wheels !!!! "" "" That 's not my new car , "" said Des . "" It 's not ? "" said Clive . "" It 's my new shed , "" said Des . "" The wheels and engine are only temporary . "" "" Oh thank goodness , "" said Clive . "" So where 's your new car then ? "" "" I 'm not getting a new car !! "" said Des . "" There 's nothing wrong with my Fiat 126 !! I will keep it forever !! "" Clive started weeping again . Just then Mike the Manic Mechanic turned up . "" What 's wrong with him ?! "" said Mike . "" I do n't know , he 's just got some ridiculous in-built prejudice against both Fiat 126s and sheds on wheels , "" said Des . "" Well , whatever , let 's get your car shipshape again ! "" said Mike . "" Or even carshape again ! "" Mike spent the next five hours returning all the car bits and pieces from the shed to the car . "" There , what did I tell you ! "" said Mike . "" It 's as good as new !! "" Des had to admit , his Fiat 126 was now just as it had been before Mike started meddling with it . "" That 'll be £ 500 + VAT please , "" said Mike . "" What ?!?! "" exclaimed Des . "" I thought you were doing it as a favour ! "" "" I was ! "" said Mike . "" And an extremely inexpensive favour it was too ! "" Des handed the cash to Mike , who then went back to his garage . Just then PC Plod came along . "" Good afternoon sir , have you managed to produce a vehicle registration certificate for that shed yet ? "" asked Plod . "" PC Plod , what are you talking about , why do I need a vehicle registration certificate for a shed ?! "" Plod stared long and hard at the shed . It was indeed an ordinary , common-or-garden shed ! He scratched his head and then tried rubbing his eyes . "" Err , well , err ... sorry to bother you sir , I did have rather a long night ... "" Plod hurried back to the police station to book a long holiday . Meanwhile Des went over to Mick's house and rang his doorbell . Mick answered . "" Mick , I 've got a problem , "" said Des . Mick groaned . "" You see my new shed ? "" said Des . "" How are we going to get it from the front drive to the back garden ? "" "" How about taking your house apart , lifting the shed across and then putting your house back together ! "" "" That 's a good idea ... naah , it 'd take too long ! "" said Des . "" Quicker to take the shed apart ! "" Des grabbed a reluctant Mick over to his front drive . "" Now this ca n't be too difficult , I 'm sure I 've done it sometime before ... "" said Des . "" All I need is a hammer . Because if I had a hammer , I 'd hammer in the morning , I 'd hammer in the evening , all over this land . "" "" What about the afternoon ? "" said Mick . "" Tea break , "" said Des . He went and fetched a couple of hammers and they set to work taking the shed apart . Then they carried the parts through the garage and into the back garden , which was still covered in moose's heads , skeletons , bird cages etc. By now Mick was exhausted , so Des single-handedly put the shed back together , in its new , permanent position at long last . "" There you go ! "" said Des . "" Looks great , does n't it ! "" "" No , "" said Mick . Des was about to start piling all his junk into the new shed when Mick decided to point something out to him . "" Des , "" said Mick . "" Your new shed looks as though it 's about to collapse ! "" "" Really ? "" said Des . He stared carefully at it . "" Oh yes , you 're right ! "" Following Des's rebuild , all of the walls were now leaning inwards . In fact they were on the brink of falling right in . "" Now I remember why the walls on the old shed always leant inwards !! "" exclaimed Des . "" Tell you what , can I borrow your rake ? """	6

208	"Eighth session Kingston , Jamaica 5-16 August 2002 Summary presentations on polymetallic massive sulphide deposits and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts Marine minerals and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea1 A scientific revolution in our understanding of the way the Earth works occurred in the 1970s and early 1980s which significantly expanded our knowledge of marine minerals while the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was being formulated . The scientific revolution entailed a major change in viewing the ocean basins and continents . Before the scientific revolution , the ocean basins were viewed as passive containers for the oceans . The continents and ocean basins were viewed as permanent features that had remained in their present positions through most of Earth's history . The marine mineral provisions of the Convention were written in terms of this old view , which only recognized those marine mineral deposits that had been derived from erosion of land and carried into the ocean in particulate or dissolved form by rivers . These minerals comprised heavy metal deposits ( tin , gold , etc. ) and gemstones ( especially diamonds ) deposited in sediments on continental margins , and manganese nodules precipitated on the floor of the deep ocean from metals dissolved in seawater . The scientific revolution revealed that the ocean basins are dynamic features that open and close on a time scale of millions of years , with concomitant movement of the land areas known as continental drift . The scientific revolution recognized the ocean basins as sources of types of mineral deposits in addition to those previously known . These newly recognized types of marine mineral resources include polymetallic sulphides containing copper , zinc , silver and gold in varying amounts . Polymetallic sulphide deposits are concentrated over thousands of years by seafloor hot springs at sites along an active global submerged volcanic mountain range that extends through all the ocean basins of the world . Polymetallic sulphide deposits also occur at sites associated with volcanic island chains such as those along the western boundary of the Pacific Ocean . Another newly recognized type of marine mineral resource is cobalt-rich iron-manganese crusts that are precipitated over millions of years on the submerged flanks of inactive underwater volcanoes from metals dissolved in seawater derived from input of metals by both rivers and seafloor hot springs . The hot springs not only concentrate polymetallic sulphide deposits and disperse metals into the oceans that contribute to the accumulation of cobalt-rich iron-manganese crusts , but also provide chemical energy from the Earth's interior that is used by microbes for their growth . The microbes are at the base of the food chain of an ecosystem of life forms at the hot springs that is largely independent of the light energy that fuels the photosynthesis in plants at the base of the food chain on land . The microbes are proving important as the source of new compounds for industrial and medical applications , and also include primitive forms that may hold the key to the origin of life . A current challenge is to incorporate these new mineral resources into the Convention regime in a way that protects the valuable life forms that they host . Polymetallic massive sulphide deposits at the modern seafloor and their resource potential2 Since 1979 , polymetallic massive sulphide deposits have been found at water depths up to 3,700 m in a variety of tectonic settings at the modern seafloor , including mid-ocean ridges , back-arc rifts and seamounts . Many of the sulphide deposits consist of a black smoker complex on top of a sulphide mound which commonly is underlain by a stockwork zone . It has been widely established that circulating seawater which is modified in a reaction zone close to a subaxial magma chamber is the principal carrier of metals and sulphur which are leached out of the oceanic basement . Precipitation of massive and stockwork sulphides at and beneath the seafloor takes place in response to mixing of the high-temperature ( up to 400 ° C ) metal-rich hydrothermal seawater fluid with ambient seawater . Polymetallic seafloor sulphide deposits can reach considerable size ( up to 100 million tonnes ) and often carry high concentrations of copper ( chalcopyrite ) , zinc ( sphalerite ) and lead ( galena ) in addition to gold and silver . It has been clearly documented that the mineralogical and chemical composition of polymetallic massive sulphides at the basalt-dominated mid-ocean ridges differs from those at back-arc spreading centres which are associated with more felsic volcanic rocks ( dacite , rhyolite ) . The latter are more similar to major sulphide deposits that are being mined on land today but which were once formed at spreading centres of paleo-oceans . Extremely high concentrations of gold ( up to 230 g / t with an average of 26 g / t for 40 samples analysed ) have recently been found in a new type of seafloor mineral deposit located in the crater of an extinct volcano in the territorial waters of Papua New Guinea . The particular style of mineralization and alteration bears many similarities to so-called "" epithermal gold deposits "" so far only known on the continents . In addition to circulating seawater , magmatic fluids carrying high concentrations of gold appear to be a significant metal source and are likely responsible for the strong precious metal enrichment . This type of mineralization is most likely to exist in other arc-related environments of the world's oceans . Due to the high concentration of base and precious metals , seafloor polymetallic sulphide deposits have recently attracted the interest of the international mining industry . The recovery of some of these deposits appears to be both economically and environmentally feasible due to certain advantages over land-based deposits and will likely become a reality within the present decade . Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts : geology , resources and technology3 Cobalt-rich iron-manganese crusts occur throughout the global ocean on seamounts , ridges and plateaux where currents have kept the rocks swept clean of sediments for millions of years . Crusts precipitate from cold ambient seawater onto rock substrates , forming pavements up to 250 mm thick . Crusts are important as a potential resource primarily for cobalt , but also for titanium , cerium , nickel , platinum , manganese , thallium , tellurium , tungsten , bismuth , zirconium and other metals . Crusts form at water depths of about 400-4 , 000 m , with the thickest and most cobalt-rich crusts occurring at depths of about 800-2 , 500 m . Gravity processes such as landslides , as well as sediment cover , submerged and emergent reefs , and currents control the distribution and thickness of crusts . Crusts occur on a wide variety of substrate rocks , making it difficult to distinguish the crusts from the substrate using remotely sensed data , which is an important aspect in terms of developing exploration technologies . Fortunately , crusts can be distinguished from the substrates by their much higher levels of gamma radiation . The physical properties of crusts , such as high mean porosity ( 60 per cent ) and extremely high mean surface area ( 300 m2 / g ) , as well as their incredibly slow rates of growth ( 1-6 millimetres per million years ) , are instrumental in allowing for the adsorption of large quantities of economically important metals from seawater onto the crust surfaces . Crusts are composed of the minerals vernadite ( manganese oxide ) and feroxyhyte ( iron oxide ) , with moderate amounts of carbonate fluorapatite ( CFA ) in thick crusts and minor amounts of quartz and feldspar in most crusts . Elements that commonly adsorbed on the vernadite include cobalt , nickel , zinc and thallium , and on the iron oxide , copper , lead , titanium , molybdenum , arsenic , vanadium , tungsten , zirconium , bismuth and tellurium . Bulk crusts contain maximum cobalt contents of up to 1.7 per cent , nickel to 1.1 per cent , and platinum to 1.3 parts per million ( ppm ) . Average cobalt contents of up to 0.5 to 1 per cent for large regions of the oceans make crusts the richest potential ore for cobalt that exists , onshore as well as offshore . Cobalt , nickel , titanium and platinum concentrations decrease , whereas silicon and aluminium increase in continental-margin crusts and in crusts with close proximity to West Pacific volcanic arcs . Vernadite-related elements decrease , whereas iron and copper increase with increasing water depth of crust occurrence . Cobalt , cerium , thallium , titanium , lead , tellurium and platinum are strongly concentrated in crusts over other metals because they are incorporated by oxidation reactions that produce more stable , less mobile compounds . Total rare-earth elements commonly vary between 0.1 per cent and 0.3 per cent and are derived from seawater along with other hydrogenetic elements , cobalt , manganese , nickel , etc. Cerium is a rare-earth element that is strongly enriched in crusts and has important economic potential . The seamounts and ridges on which crusts grow obstruct the flow of oceanic water masses , thereby creating a wide array of seamount-generated currents of generally enhanced energy relative to flow away from the seamounts . The effects of these currents are strongest at the outer rim of the summit region of seamounts , the area where the thickest crusts are found . Those seamount-specific currents also enhance turbulent mixing and produce upwelling , which increases primary productivity . These physical processes affect seamount biological communities , which vary from seamount to seamount . Seamount communities are characterized by relatively low density and low diversity where the crusts are thickest and cobalt-rich . The make-up of the seamount communities is determined by current patterns , topography , bottom sediment and rock types and coverage , seamount size , water depth , and size and magnitude of the oxygen-minimum zone . Environmental impact documents will require a much better understanding of seamount ecosystems and communities than currently exits . About 40 research cruises have been dedicated to the study of cobalt-rich crusts , mainly by Germany , Japan , United States of America , the Republic of Korea , the Russia Federation , China and France . The estimate of 40 cruises does not include some cruises completed by the USSR ( and later the Russia Federation ) and China that are not available to the author . However , based on an estimated 42 research cruises from 1981 through 2001 , it is suggested that minimum expenditures were about US $ 32 million for ship and associated scientific operations related to fieldwork , and $ 42 million for shore-based research , for a total investment of about $ 74 million . Research and development on the technology for mining crusts are only in their infancy . Detailed maps of crust deposits and a comprehensive understanding of small-scale seamount topography are not available , but are required to design the most appropriate mining strategies . Typical field operations for exploration have been to produce SeaBeam bathymetric maps and derivative back-scatter and slope-angle maps , along with seismic profiles , which are used together to select sampling sites . For reconnaissance work , 15 to 20 dredge hauls and cores are taken per seamount . Then video-camera surveys delineate crust , rock and sediment types and distributions , as well as crust thicknesses if possible . These exploration activities require the use of a large , well-equipped research vessel because of the large number of bottom acoustic beacons , the large towed equipment and the volume of samples collected . During advanced stages of exploration and site-specific surveys , it is suggested to use deep-towed side-scan sonar including swath bathymetry , and tethered remotely operated vehicles ( ROVs ) for mapping and delineation of small-scale topography . Extensive sampling of deposits can be accomplished by dredging , coring , using ROVs , and a device to take close-spaced samples that has not yet been developed . Gamma-radiation surveys will delineate crust thicknesses and the existence of crusts under thin blankets of sediment . Current-meter moorings will be required for an understanding of the seamount environment and biological sampling and surveys will be necessary . Twelve criteria have been developed for exploration for and exploitation of crusts : ( a ) Regional criteria ( i ) Large volcanic edifices shallower than 1 , 000-1 , 500 m ; ( ii ) Volcanic edifices older than 20 million years ; ( iii ) Volcanic structures not capped by large atolls or reefs ; ( iv ) Areas of strong and persistent bottom currents ; ( v ) A shallow and well-developed oxygen-minimum zone ; ( vi ) Areas isolated from input of abundant fluvial and eolian debris . ( b ) Site-specific criteria ( vii ) Subdued small-scale topography ; ( viii ) Summit terraces , saddles and passes ; ( ix ) Slope stability ; ( x ) Absence of local volcanism ; ( xi ) Average cobalt contents ≥ 0 . 8 per cent ; ( xii ) Average crust thicknesses ≥ 40 mm . Crust mining is technologically more difficult than manganese nodule mining . Recovery of nodules is relatively easy because they sit on a soft-sediment substrate , whereas crusts are weakly to strongly attached to substrate rock . For successful crust mining , it is essential to recover the crusts without collecting substrate rock , which would significantly dilute the ore grade . Five possible crust mining operations include fragmentation , crushing , lifting , pick-up and separation . The proposed method of crust recovery consists of a bottom-crawling vehicle attached to a surface-mining vessel by means of a hydraulic-pipe lift system and an electrical umbilical . The mining machine provides its own propulsion and travels at a speed of about 20 cm / s. Material throughput for the base-case mining scenario is 1,000,000 t / y . That scenario allows 80 per cent fragmentation efficiency and 25 per cent dilution of crust with substrate as reasonable miner capabilities . Some new and innovative systems that have been suggested for crust mining include water-jet stripping of crusts from the substrate , in situ leaching techniques and sonic removal of crusts from substrates . These suggestions offer promise and need to be further developed . The importance to the world economy of metals contained in crusts is reflected in their patterns of consumption . The primary uses of manganese , cobalt and nickel are in the manufacture of steel , to which they provide unique characteristics . Cobalt is also used in the electrical , communications , aerospace , and engine and tool manufacturing industries . Nickel is used additionally in chemical plants , petroleum refineries , electrical appliances and motor vehicles . Cobalt is produced as a by-product of copper mining and consequently the supply of cobalt is tied to the demand for copper . This is also true for tellurium , which is produced as a by-product of both copper and gold mining . This uncertainty in supply has caused industry to seek alternatives to cobalt and tellurium , resulting in only a modest growth in their markets over the past decade , and consequently relatively low prices . If substantial alternative sources of these metals are developed , there should be a greater incentive to reintroduce them in products and expanding markets . It has recently been determined that crusts contain metals other than manganese , cobalt , nickel , copper and platinum that may offer additional incentives in recovery . For example , titanium has the highest value after cobalt , cerium has a greater value than nickel , zirconium is equivalent to nickel , and tellurium has nearly twice the value of copper . This analysis assumes that economic extractive metallurgy can be developed for each of those metals . Based on grade , tonnage and oceanographic conditions , the central-equatorial Pacific region offers the best potential for crust mining , particularly the exclusive economic zone of Johnston Island ( United States ) , the Marshall Islands and international waters in the Mid-Pacific Mountains , although the exclusive economic zone of French Polynesia , Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia should also be considered . Supplies of the many metals found in crusts are essential for maintaining the efficiency of modern industrial societies and in improving the standard of living in the twenty-first century . There is a growing recognition that cobalt-rich crusts are an important potential resource . Accordingly , it is necessary to fill the information gap concerning various aspects of crust mining through research , exploration and technology development . Sulphide mineral resource exploitation and the hydrothermal vent fauna4 More than 500 new animal species have been described from deep-sea hydrothermal vents since their discovery in 1977 . Deep-sea vents have a high scientific value because they contain a large number of endemic and unusual species and are refuges for close relatives of ancient forms of life . Because they are visually spectacular , extreme environments , vent ecosystems have generated widespread public interest and are a resource which can be used to inform the public about earth processes and the way in which scientists work . It is not currently possible to predict how rapidly vent sites may recover from mining operations . Some organisms will be directly killed by mining machinery , while others nearby risk smothering by material settling from plumes of particulate matter . Individuals surviving these perturbations would be subject to a radical change in habitat , and the exploited sites will have a lesser scientific and educational value . Long-lived vent fields that host the largest mineral deposits are likely to be the most ecologically stable and have the highest biodiversity . A concentration of mining activities at such sites could produce regional effects on biological processes and organism abundance , to the point where the survival of some species could become an issue . The management or protection of all of the world's marine hydrothermal and seep sites is an unrealistic goal . Discussions should focus instead on the criteria for identifying sites for future protection that are of critical importance , or particularly sensitive to disturbance , because of their scientific or educational value or their significance for species survival .

204	"re document forming part of the reports of states parties latvia [ 26 February 2002 ] Paragraphs Page General information The Republic of Latvia is an independent and democratic State situated in north-eastern Europe on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea covering 64,589 square kilometres . The State borders with the Republic of Estonia in the north , with the Republic of Lithuania in the south and with the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation in the east . The landscape of the country is marked by lowland plains and rolling hills and most of the countryside is less than 100 metres above sea level . The country historically and culturally is divided into four regions : Kurzeme , Latgale , Zemgale and Vidzeme . There are 7 cities , 69 towns , 26 districts and 483 local municipalities in Latvia . The capital of the Republic of Latvia is Riga . The official language of the State is Latvian , which is one of the oldest of the Indo-European languages and is spoken by approximately 70-75 per cent of the population . The national currency is the lats ( LVL ) , officially pegged to the SDR ( Special Drawing Rights ) basket of currencies at the rate of 0.7997 SDR / LVL . The table below represents the basic statistical data on the characteristics of the Latvian population for the year 2000 / 01 . Table ( continued ) Demographic characteristics In year 2000 the population census was held throughout the country . There were 2,375,000 inhabitants , approximately 1,093,000 males and 1,282,000 females , permanently residing in the territory of Latvia . At the beginning of the year 2001 408,700 Latvians were under 15 , 1,448,400 aged from 15 to 59 and 509,000 aged 60 and over . According to the previous population census held in 1989 , the percentage of the population under 15 fell from 21.4 per cent to 17.3 per cent but the percentage of the population aged 60 years and over increased from 17.4 per cent to 21.5 per cent . The overall decline in the State's population since 1996 is given below . ( Population figures have been revised on the basis of the results of the 2000 population census . As a consequence of tremendous political and socio-economic changes in the State since 1991 , the natural population growth has been negative . However , in 1999 the natural growth slowly improved . In 1999 , the number of children born in comparison with 1998 increased by 5.4 per cent . Furthermore , in 2000 the death rate per 100,000 residents was 1,357 - slightly lower than in 1999 . The natural population growth is given below . The death rate of newborns has decreased from 15.8 per 1,000 in 1996 to 10.4 per 1,000 in 2000 . The number of cases of maternal death per 100,000 babies born alive had decreased from 40.4 in 1996 to 24.8 in 2000 . The Government has taken appropriate measures to improve the demographic situation ; thus , the Ministry of Welfare elaborated and the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia in February 2001 adopted "" The Strategy of Health Care of Mother and Child in Latvia "" . Ethnic characteristics During the 1990s the proportion of ethnic Latvians slightly increased while the proportion of Russians , Byelorussians , Ukrainians , Poles and other ethnic groups decreased . During 2000 the number of Latvians was also slightly higher , compared with other national groups living in Latvia . The distribution of Latvia's population by ethnic origin between 1935 and 2001 is shown in the table below . Long-term historical cohabitation and friendly relations among different ethnic groups have made Latvia a place where significant conflicts among various ethnic and religious groups have not been possible . After regaining independence , the Government elaborated a policy to accommodate its various groups and their many cultural and religious traditions . The model which was chosen could be called "" a national State with a multicultural society "" : national in the sense that a condition of integration is one official State language and a unified territory , and multicultural in the sense that there is no common or State-supported religion and there are schools with different languages of instruction and conditions promoting development of all cultures . Since 1999 the State Programme of Integration of Society has been carried out and a special institution - the Fund for the Integration of the Society - is in the process of formation . The goals of the programme are to form a democratic , consolidated civil society founded on shared basic values , to provide for all people permanently residing in Latvia access to contemporary living standards , and to promote welfare , education , security and favourable relations between the various ethnic groups . Economic indicators Latvia has made significant advances in its economic , financial and social development since regaining its independence in 1990 , and has embraced comprehensive market economy reform . During the last several years , Government agreed on and continued the structural reform of the economy by accelerating privatization , strengthening the banking sector and the financial system in general , and stabilizing the overall situation in industry and agriculture . GDP growth has been based on a broad range of developments . Particularly strong advances have been made during the last decade in the transportation and financial sectors , in communication services and commerce . Since the beginning of the transition to a market economy , the Government has implemented a strict fiscal policy through a major revenue mobilization combined with expenditure restraint . Latvia has made substantial progress in establishing the State institutions needed for fiscal management in a market economy . Consistently tight monetary and successful financial policies have been reflected in the continuous fall of inflation from 958.6 per cent in 1992 to 23.1 per cent in 1995 , 13.1 per cent in 1996 and 7.0 per cent in 1997 . In 1998 the annual inflation rate fell to 2.8 per cent , in 1999 the annual inflation rate was at 3.2 per cent and in 2000 it was 1.8 per cent . The table below shows the key indicators of economic development of the State ( the data for 2001 are estimates ) . Table ( continued ) The unemployment rate since 1998 has been decreasing slightly , although the rate is still relatively high . In order to address this issue , the National Employment Plan is elaborated annually . The main aims of the Plan are to prevent young unemployed people from becoming long-term unemployed ; to eliminate barriers to business and restrictions to starting entrepreneurial activity ; to strengthen cooperation between the Confederation of Employers and the Confederation of Free Trade Unions ; to implement measures aimed at ensuring equal opportunities for women and men in the labour market ; to reduce gender inequality in the area of employment and revenues ; and to encourage family-friendly social and labour policies . The basic detailed unemployment data in Latvia are the following : The gross wage earned by people employed in the national economy in 2000 grew on average by 6.1 per cent in comparison with the preceding year and reached almost 150 lats . The table below indicates the income of residents of the Republic of Latvia . The Government recognizes that notwithstanding the country's substantial development and economic growth , the polarization of the society still continues . The results of the household budget surveys show that average household income per person is increasing , but simultaneously the income of the poorest members of society is decreasing even more . ii . political structure Historical background Historically , the territory of Latvia has always been regarded as a trading and transportation crossroads and has long served as a bridge between Western Europe and Russia . The ancestors of the Latvian nation settled on Latvian soil more than 4,000 years ago . Today Latvia has a multi-ethnic society and culture that has developed because of the historical , economic and social evolution of the country , providing good possibilities for using Latvia as a stable location to work in the Eastern and Western markets . The Republic of Latvia as a national State was proclaimed on 18 November 1918 in accordance with the principles of international law , and since then its de iure legal personality has never been interrupted . Latvia was granted international recognition in 1920 and became a member of the League of Nations in 1921 . It has been continuously recognized as a State by other countries since 1920 despite occupations by the Soviet Union ( 1940-1941 , 1945-1991 ) and Nazi Germany ( 1941-1945 ) . The will and the right to self-determination of the people of Latvia was expressed in April 1920 when the people of Latvia gave their mandate to the Constitutional Assembly chosen in universal , equal , direct and proportional elections . The nation was united by the Latvian Provisional Government and on 11 August 1920 a peace treaty with Russia was signed in which Russia recognized Latvia's independence . In February 1922 , the Assembly adopted the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia , which is still in force with some amendments , among them chapter VIII on Fundamental Human Rights , adopted in 1998 . Until 1940 , Latvia witnessed impressive economic growth , a flourishing cultural life and a marked improvement in its standard of living . To guarantee the State's economic and social stability , the Government of Latvia launched a programme of agrarian reform . Latvian culture was encouraged and ethnic minorities , which comprised around 25 per cent of the population , were granted educational rights . The ultimatum of 16 June 1940 from the Government of the Soviet Union to the Latvian Government , asking for its resignation , and the ensuing military aggression , resulted in the occupation of Latvia . The elections of 14 and 15 July 1940 of the Parliament ( Saeima ) of occupied Latvia were held under conditions of political terror after an illegal and unconstitutional elections law had been adopted . Of the 17 lists of candidates submitted , only one was permitted in the elections - the list of the Working People's Bloc . The pre-election platform of the Bloc did not include any demand to establish Soviet power in Latvia or to join the Soviet Union . Furthermore , the results of the elections were falsified . The illegally and fraudulently formed Parliament did not represent the will of the Latvian people . It had no constitutional powers to change the system of government and bring to an end the sovereignty of Latvia . Only the people had the right to decide these matters , but no referendum was held . The incorporation of Latvia into the Soviet Union in 1940 is considered to be invalid also in accordance with international law . The will of the people of Latvia for freedom was expressed in the elections of the Latvian Supreme Council in 1990 of which a majority afterwards expressed the determination to restore the independence of Latvia . The Declaration of the Supreme Council of the Latvian SSR "" On the Renewal of the Independence of the Republic of Latvia "" was adopted on 4 May 1990 . Being determined to restore de facto the free , democratic and independent Republic of Latvia , the Supreme Council of the Latvian SSR on that date declared illegal the joining of Latvia to the Soviet Union . Furthermore , it decided to re-establish the authority of the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia , adopted by the Constitutional Assembly on 15 February 1922 , in the entire territory of Latvia . On 17 September 1991 Latvia became a full-fledged member of the United Nations . Since 1995 it has been a member State of the Council of Europe . On 12 June 1995 , an Association Agreement was signed with the European Community and its member States , which came into force in February 1998 . Political framework The legislative power is granted to the Saeima ( Parliament ) as well as to the people to the extent provided for by the Satversme ( Constitution ) . Furthermore , the Saeima approves the appointment of the judges of courts of all levels and declares amnesties . It consists of 100 Saeima members elected in general , direct , secret and proportional elections . The Saeima is elected for a period of four years . The Saeima elects the President of the State for a period of four years and the same person can not hold the office of President of the State for more than two consecutive terms . The President of the State fulfils rather representative functions , however , it is the President of the State who nominates the Head of the Government - the Prime Minister . The Prime Minister forms the Government ( the Cabinet of Ministers ) - the executive power of the State - and receives the confidence of the Saeima ( Parliament ) . Latvia has a three-level court system - district / city courts , regional courts and the Supreme Court . The establishment of the Satversme Court ( Constitutional Court ) in 1996 completed the judicial reform in Latvia . The Public Prosecutor's Office , the Collegium of Sworn Advocates and the Collegium of Notaries are the indispensable elements of the judicial system of the Republic of Latvia . iii . general legal framework within which human rights are protected Article 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia ( Satversme ) provides that Latvia is an independent democratic republic . This principle sets forth certain exact requirements for the Latvian legal system , which also influence the implementation of the obligations under the international human rights instruments . On 4 May 1990 the Supreme Council of the Soviet Republic of Latvia being concerned about the compliance of national law with international law principles in the sphere of human rights , adopted the Declaration on Accession to International Acts of Human Rights . By the Declaration Latvia acceded to 51 international documents ( declarations and conventions ) , inter alia the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . The Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights entered into force on 22 September 1994 ; thus , the Republic of Latvia recognizes the competence of the Human Rights Committee to receive and consider communications from individuals who claim to be victims of a violation by the State of the human rights set forth in the Covenant . Moreover , on 27 June 1997 the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 4 November 1950 entered into force in the Republic of Latvia . Thus , Latvia has accepted the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights and accordingly an individual may complain about a violation of his / her rights provided for by the European Convention directly to the Court . In October 1998 , the Constitution of Latvia ( Satversme ) was amended and chapter VIII on Fundamental Human Rights was included . The adoption of these amendments clarified the debate concerning the role and legal status of human rights in the State's legal system . It also added a more concrete understanding to the principle of democracy , as embodied in article 1 of the Satversme . Accordingly , article 89 states : "" The State shall recognize and protect fundamental human rights in accordance with the present Constitution , laws and international agreements binding upon Latvia . "" Article 91 of the Constitution encompasses both the principle of equality and the principle of non-discrimination . This article states : "" All human beings in Latvia shall be equal before the law and the courts . Human rights shall be secured without discrimination of any kind . "" Other newly included articles of the Constitution list fundamental human rights guaranteed by the State and also provide for possible restrictions on the exercise of these rights imposed by the State . International human rights treaties are directly applicable in the domestic legal system . They override norms of statutory law in case of a conflict of norms . It should be emphasized that international human rights norms are understood to have special status in relation to statutory laws because of their special aim and object and a direct link to the principle of democracy as embodied in Satversme . Thus , Satversme and international human rights treaties binding for Latvia provide for the catalogue of human rights and freedoms in the State . Regarding the institutional protection of human rights , the independent judiciary and the administrative process are the key elements . The courts are the main judicial institutions having jurisdiction over issues of respect and observance of human rights . According to the Law on the Judicial Power Latvia has a three-level court system . The district / city courts try civil , criminal and administrative cases ; they function mostly as courts of first instance . There are regional courts in each of the regions of Latvia and in the capital , Riga , that try those civil and criminal cases that fall within their authority under the Law on Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure ; regional courts are also the courts of appeal for those cases that have been tried by district / city courts . The Supreme Court is the court of appeal and cassation for all cases tried by regional courts and district / city courts . The Supreme Court acts also as the first instance court for several cases according to the Law on the Judicial Branch . According to article 3 of the Law on the Judicial Branch every individual has the right to be protected by the court against infringements upon his / her life , health , personal freedom , honour , reputation and property . All individuals have equal rights to have their case heard fairly and publicly by an independent and impartial court , which determines his / her civil rights and obligations , or the validity of any criminal charge against him / her . Article 4 of the above-mentioned Law states that all individuals are equal before the law and the court , and have an equal right to be protected by law . Justice is administered by the court irrespective of the person's origin , social status and property , race and nationality , sex , education , language , religious affiliation , type and nature of occupation , place of residence , and political or other views . According to article 17 of the Law on the Constitutional Court ( Satversme Court ) individuals whose fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution have been violated have the right to "" submit an application to initiate a case regarding compliance of laws and international agreements signed or entered into by Latvia - even before the Saeima has confirmed the agreement - with the Constitution ; compliance of other normative acts or their parts with the legal norms ( acts ) of higher legal force ; as well as compliance of national legal norms of Latvia with international agreements entered into by Latvia which are not contrary to the Constitution "" . In 1995 , the Regulations on the Process of Administrative Acts of the Cabinet of Ministers were adopted , establishing the procedure by which individuals may ask for , or complain about , or appeal against an administrative act adopted by a public institution . There are two main situations where an individual may appeal before the court against an administrative act : when the administrative act violates his / her rights provided in the Constitution of Latvia , international human rights instruments binding on Latvia or a statutory law ; or when the procedure governing the adoption of an administrative act has been abused . The law on the Prosecutor's Office and the Law "" On the Police "" provide that the Prosecutor's Office and the police also protect individuals against infringements upon their life , health , personal freedom , honour , reputation and property . According to the Law "" On the Repayment of Damages or Losses Caused by Unlawful or Unfounded Acts of Investigators , the Prosecutor's Office or the Court "" , material compensation is paid to individuals who have suffered from unlawful or unfounded acts by State officials . Furthermore , the State Human Rights Office , the independent national institution , has a duty to review any claim of infringement of human rights in Latvia and immediately react on a violation of an individual's rights , and on its own initiative , to investigate . iv . information and publicity Whenever the Republic of Latvia concludes an international agreement , the text of the agreement is translated into Latvian and published in the official newspaper , Latvijas Vēstnesis . In addition , the text in the original language of the agreement is published as well ( usually in English ) . This procedure applies also to international human rights instruments . Furthermore , the State institutions have access to the normative acts and international treaties and conventions in force in Latvia in the electronic database of the State . In addition , information on various international human rights instruments have been published in booklets by the State Human Rights Office . UNDP , UNHCR , UNESCO and UNICEF have opened representative offices that are functioning , with good results , in Latvia . Publications about human right issues have appeared and have been made available to any member of the society : "" Guidebook of Human Rights Tolerance "" , "" Human Rights Album "" ( published by the European Union ) , "" Concise Explanation of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights "" and others . Booklets on the rights of the child have been published and distributed by the Children Rights Protection Centre . The Latvian Human Rights Institute , which is the independent section of the State University quarterly , publishes a legal journal - Latvian Human Rights Quarterly - which contains articles on human rights issues in Latvia and abroad , international treaties and national laws , decisions of the European Court of Human Rights as well as of national courts concerning violations of human rights , as well as information on various activities ( conferences , seminars , courses on human rights ) provided by the Latvian Human Rights Institute or other institutions in Latvia . The national reports on the implementation of the human rights conventions in Latvia are prepared by working groups consisting of representatives of ministries and other State institutions and headed by the Representative of the Government before International Human Rights Organizations . Although the publication of reports is not required in national legislation , the practice to do so is developing . As a result of the cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Latvian Human Rights Institute , the report and debate concerning the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was published in the Official Gazette and the Latvian Human Rights Quarterly . The Views of the Human Rights Committee on individual applications concerning possible violations of the Covenant were also published in the Official Gazette .

1290	"Book Reviews Promoting Health : The Primary Health Care Approach - Second Edition It is the author's hope that this book will reflect the spirit of primary health care . This will contribute to a growing understanding among health workers of health promoting work , both at local and international levels . This hope is achieved because the book is based on principles of effective , balanced , appropriate and just health system . It focuses on barriers for implementing primary health care and health promotion strategies and in particular why these are looking increasingly at odds against economic rationalism . The latter is very useful to the reader to gain an understanding on why the commitment to primary health approach is weakening despite its principles being more challenged . This book is designed to provide both a theoretical introduction and practical strategies for action . The reader is expected to have a basic understanding of sociology , psychology , health and illness , however , it is based on an examination of skills and issues addressed in undergraduate nursing and health science courses . It is an essential book for students in the field and an excellent guidebook for the more experienced . The second edition has been improved by an excellent reference list at the end of each chapter . The reader is also encouraged to further readings by directions to references entwined in the text . This makes it very easy to seek more information on particular issues . Also , compared to first edition , major historical developments have been up dated and more emphasis is placed on barriers to implementation of the primary health approach . The book consists of ten chapters , which starts with an examination of the development of primary health care at both Australian and International levels . The first chapter discusses the development of the new public health movement and gives examples of major barriers in implementing primary health care . Some major policy development processes in Australia are discussed in relation to the extent to which these policies embrace the primary health approach . Chapter two defines health and health promotion and contains related discussions of value-based issues within the two concepts . The discussions raise questions , which force the reader to reflect on the complexities of the health promotion activities , in particular the concept of participation has been examined and provides the reader with a good understanding of this concept . Chapter three introduces research in the areas of health promotion and examines the major issues in community needs assessment . The chapter argues successfully about the importance of research for an ongoing integrated health promotion practice . It focuses on two methodologies namely ; feminist research and participatory action research and explains how those methods are particularly appropriate in health promotional work . Chapter four explores the issues in evaluation of primary health and health promotion . It argues that community assessment and evaluation ought to be a recurring process in good health promotional work and explains why the lines between the two concepts can be very fine . The discussion emphases , faithfully to the primary health approach , that participatory evaluation must be a key feature in practice . The planning , component and process in evaluation is described and the Australian health and community service standards are suggested as a framework for helping with this process . Chapters 5 to 9 explore a number of strategies useful in promoting health - working with mass media , community development , working for public policy change , group work and health education . The four chapters can be read independent of each others as each chapter is based on primary health care approach explained in the first four chapters in the book . Most importantly to successful health promotional work is that of working in-groups and understanding group dynamics . Chapter eight offers a very good insight and is ( again ) full of useful advice . Chapter nine is of great importance , in particular to the novice practitioner , as it assists excellently to understand why the choice of educational methods is critical for successful outcomes of health promotional work . Chapter ten makes a number of suggestions about how to incorporate the range of material presented in the book into own practice of the reader . It provides a very useful guide for anyone considering "" doing project "" . It gives practical suggestions to how to implement health promotion activities and concludes by pulling it all together . It also raises some critical questions for the reader to consider in relation to future activities . This is an excellent dictionary for the experienced health practitioner and encourages to continuing education . Reading this book makes you feel like you have "" spoken "" to some one who has spend for a long time in the field . A great gift to all of us involved in primary health care at all levels ."	5

1216	"Fisherman's Friends deaths : Door company fined £ 30 , 000 A company has been fined £ 30 , 000 following the deaths of a shanty group singer and the band's promoter after a two-tonne steel door fell on them . The stage door collapsed on Fisherman's Friends vocalist Trevor Grills and Paul McMullen at Guildford's G Live venue in 2013 . Shropshire-based Express Hi-Fold Doors Ltd was found guilty of a health and safety breach at Guildford Crown Court . Director David Naylor , 57 , was cleared of manslaughter by gross negligence . The door , which allowed backstage access from outside , was designed and manufactured by the company . Father-of-three Mr Grills , 54 , from Port Isaac , Cornwall , and Mr McMullen , from Disley in Cheshire , were at the venue ahead of a performance due to be staged by the 10-piece group . Mr McMullen , 44 , died at the scene and Mr Grills in hospital three days later . Sentencing , judge Philippa Whipple , said there was no "" deliberate disregard for the law "" but the company "" fell far short of the appropriate health and safety standard "" . The court heard the door had been folded in half and was being lifted "" like a canopy "" above the men when it collapsed . Two drive chains linking the motor and gearbox to the drive shaft failed , and the chains themselves also failed , jurors were told . The court heard there had been four similar failures involving the company's doors before 2010 , including the collapse of a hangar door at Shoreham Airport in 2003 . The judge said : "" The company made some modifications , but it failed to respond more fundamentally to ensure it had taken all practicable measures . "" There was an obvious risk of death or serious injury although the likelihood was not high . "" The court heard the business barely traded in 2015 and was essentially liquidated . Paying tribute to the men and their families , the judge said : "" They died too young and I am sure they are greatly missed . "" Fisherman's Friends had chart success with a top-ten album and performed at Glastonbury ."	8
847	It is worthwhile considering that one of the reasons that the EU may be cautious about GM might be because of the EU constituent's moral and ethical concerns about gene technology in planta . If this is the case then whether or not GM food is safe to eat ( and there is no evidence to suggest that it is n't ) is beside the point . The question is whether people have the right to choose what they eat and if this is based on moral and ethical grounds then debate about the EU's request for labelling should also be considered on these grounds .	0
1164	"Offshore jobs Offshore jobs nowadays are the cause of a discord in the United States of America . Many people believe that offshore jobs have rather negative impact on the country's economy , then positive . Various sides of this problem are reviewed and analyzed and for now it has even become a problem of an ethical aspect . But before making any statements it is very important to get into a deep understanding of what "" offshore "" really is . "" Offshore jobs "" in the contemporary American world means that the company hires employees not in the country it functions , but "" off its shore "" , in other countries . From the first glance it may seem : what is wrong with hiring people abroad ? Well , the main point is that there are no extra working places for these employees ; it may be called a "" replacement "" . Say , the company has a worker , why would it prefer to hire a person from another country to work on his place ? The answer for this question is simple - money . The main interest of American companies in hiring people from other countries is getting competent employees at much lower wages . The way this system works is uniquely simple and oppressing at the same time . An American company decides that it can hire an employee from another country , pay this person a lot less payments and get a result that will satisfy the company sufficiently . But of course that company wants to be sure that this new employee will not be a worse professional that they already have . So their next step is asking the working employee to train the future worker of the company . Literally they train people that will eventually take their working places , leaving them unemployed . India is the primary "" offshore "" supplier . Though nobody is officially forced to do the training for these people , the company provides extra paychecks for those who do , before they leave . Politicians and ordinary people argue on that – but one thing is obvious : is does cut down the moral of Americans . Americans stay without jobs , when foreigners take their places , after they themselves make the "" professional exchange "" with them . This serious matter can not pass by the American economy . We can analyze it from various sides . Yes , the companies really do increase their profit , but it is made by means of decreasing the expenses on labor . Is this sacrifice worth of the cost generally speaking ? "" Offshore "" activity of a company nowadays does not have a positive influence on the image of the company . The other side is that American workers stay unemployed , which in the first place undermines the stability of the country . The government has to pay more unemployment allowances , people feel insecure and do not trust the government . This has to do a lot with the ethical aspect of the problem . The promotion of the "" offshore "" makes people feel abject and insulted for they even train their own replacements . Some people say that instead of blaming it all on people from other countries it is better to raise the level of qualification of American workers . After the "" replacements "" pass the training in the USA they come back to their countries and keep doing their new jobs there . The job is done outside the United States of America . Of course it is always about the money and it is dictated by the tax politics of the country , but does not that hurt the feelings of American workers , does not that hurt their moral ? American workers are very qualified , too . So how fair it is to "" replace "" these professionals ? Therefore we have two different points of view on this matter . On one hand it is the raise of the company's profits and other economical benefits and on the other it is the ethical aspect of the problem , which seems more important to the majority of Americans . Of course , objectively thinking , economical benefits are weighty for the US economy . "" Offshore "" does not only decreases the wages that a company pays to its abroad employees but also becomes a door to foreign markets . So the products produced in the United States become even more popular . It is very convenient for companies to work with foreigners , because of the taxes . So if the government wants to change this situation it needs to make the taxes on domestic profits lower and this would make the companies turn to making their work and products on the territory of the United States of America and using its working force . So it is even possible to say that the phenomena of "" offshore jobs "" were caused by the amount of taxes the companies pay for domestic profits . American workers from their side can make strong advancements in their qualifications , so they would be "" irreplaceable "" by all means . "" Offshore "" jobs become more and more popular nowadays , bringing benefits for the economy of America in general and for American entrepreneurs in particular . Companies increase their profits ; pay fewer wages to the new employees . It may even be considered that "" offshore "" has more positive , than negative sides in concern of the economy . Nevertheless it is a question of how ethical it may be considered to "" replace "" American qualified workers by "" cheaper "" employees . This is problem that has to be solved by the government in order to keep American workers confident in their jobs . Though a comparatively small percentage experienced this phenomenon , even those who heard about it feel insecure and try to predict in their contracts . How ethical it may be considered to make them train these new employees that sometimes are not professionals at all ? How ethical in may be considered to share their unique experience with people who are going to take their places ? This is the issue that frightens American workers a lot . It demoralizes them and makes them feel helpless . That can not have no influence on the general mindset of American workers . So "" offshore "" jobs are an ethical problem that needs to be eliminated . Of course , it needs time and efforts from the side of the government , but may not be left as it is ."	0

782	Nature of problem : The problem treated is the analysis of the effect , on the detected AC signals , of imperfections in and misalignment of the optical components of a polarization-modulation ellipsometer . This permits correction of the values of psi and delta ( characteristics of the sample surface ) for systematic error , estimation of the uncertainty in the final result , and identification of the most significant sources of experimental error . Solution method : The transmitted amplitude vector is computer using the Jones matrices of the individual components . The modified Jones matrices introduced by O ' Handley are used to separate the DC and AC components of the detected intensity . Running time : 1.4 sec for one datum point ( systematic error correction with 5 iterations + complete calculations of experimental uncertainty ) . 0.3 sec for uncertainty calculation only .	3
844	This book is a thoughtful defence of the importance of retaining a version of dualism in ecofeminist Christian theology . Ecofeminist theologians have often tried to reconstruct theology through a total rejection of dualism . The body-soul dualism and the God-creation dualism are seen by many as the root of many evils committed against women and nature . McCulloch argues that , although some forms of dualism do have such negative consequences , a dualistic theology could avoid them . She further argues that the trend from a God-creation dualism towards pantheism in New Age thinking and ecofeminism is actually inimical to the concerns of Christian ecofeminism .	0
206	"Industrial Development Board Twenty-fifth session Vienna , 15-16 May 2002 Item 4 of the provisional agenda Report by the Director-General The financial situation as at 31 March 2002 can be summarized in the following major points : ( a ) The regular budget is being implemented with an initial allocation of 97 per cent of the 2002 appropriations . Expenditure for the first quarter amounted to 26.5 per cent ; ( b ) The operational budget recorded a surplus of € 1 . 6 million during the first quarter of 2002 ; therefore , the level of the operational budget reserve increased from € 3 . 3 million ( $ 2 . 98 million ) as at 1 January 2002 to € 4 . 9 million as at 31 March 2002 ; ( c ) The level of regular budget cash resources ( including the Working Capital Fund and the unencumbered balances of appropriations ) was € 34 . 7 million . In comparison , the cash balance as at 31 March 2001 and 2000 was € 29 . 8 million and € 24 . 3 million , respectively ; ( d ) The collection rate of 2002 assessed contributions was 47.2 per cent and was favourable compared to the 2001 and 2000 rates of 35.7 and 35.9 per cent , respectively ; ( e ) The collection rate of prior years' arrears , as compared to the current year's assessments , was 2.3 per cent . The rates as at 31 March 2001 and 2000 , as compared to the assessments of those years , were 12.4 and 2.7 per cent , respectively ; ( f ) Outstanding contributions amounted to € 144 . 9 million ( including arrears of € 69 . 3 million by the United States of America , and € 2 . 1 million by the former Yugoslavia ) ( annex I ) . The outstanding amounts as at 31 March 2001 and 2000 were € 152 . 7 million and € 158 . 6 million , respectively ( for comparison revalued at the December 2001 United Nations rate of exchange , $ 1 = € 1 . 123 , in accordance with GC . 9 / Dec. 15 ) ; ( g ) The Working Capital Fund is at the level of € 7 , 423 , 030 ( $ 6 , 610 , 000 converted at the December rate of $ 1 = € 1 . 123 ) . However , an amount of € 259 , 212 was outstanding as at 31 March 2002 ; ( h ) Pursuant to General Conference decision GC . 9 / Dec. 12 , Ukraine and UNIDO signed a payment plan on 25 March 2002 , and the first instalment under the plan was received on 28 December 2001 . Consultations are continuously taking place with a number of Member States regarding settlement of their arrears through payment plans ; ( i ) In compliance with General Conference decision GC . 9 / Dec. 10 , unencumbered balances of appropriations , income from new Member States and interest income in excess of budgetary estimates ( total amount € 7 , 195 , 414 ) are being allocated as requested by Member States ( annex II ) ; ( j ) Recent actions and developments with respect to the transition to a single currency system , as well as issues encountered , are provided as background information in a conference room paper ( IDB . 25 / CRP . 3 ) . Regular and operational budgets , 2002-2003 Regular budget implementation of the approved programme and budgets , 2002-2003 , commenced as planned . In view of the expected collection rate of assessed contributions of some 97 per cent during the year ( both for current and prior years ) , as well as the healthy cash position of the Organization at the beginning of 2002 , an average release of 97 per cent of the appropriations for 2002 under the regular budget , including UNIDO's share of Buildings Management Services , was approved . This included 100 per cent release for staff costs , the Regular Programme of Technical Cooperation , field operating costs and information technology ; and an average of 86.3 per cent under consultants , travel , meetings and operating costs . The pattern compares favourably with the start of the 2000-2001 biennium , whereby after the first three months of 2000 only 90 per cent of appropriations were released . The Buildings Management gross appropriation was released at the level of 96 per cent , reflecting the actual higher-than-budgeted vacancy rate under established posts . Operating costs were fully released . Expenditure during the period 1 January to 31 March 2002 amounted to € 18 . 1 million under the regular budget . This amount corresponds to 26.5 per cent of the total appropriation for 2002 and is comparable with the preceding biennium . The current value represents a smooth budget implementation with a lesser risk of delaying or non-implementing approved programmes . The initial allocation under the operational budget was set at 95 per cent of the approved estimate . With a $ 32 million delivery of technical cooperation activities as of 31 March 2002 ( delivery as of 31 March 2001 for the same period was $ 27 million ) , income for the first quarter amounted to € 4 . 1 million ( $ 3 . 6 million ) for support cost reimbursement . Expenditure for the same period amounted to € 2 . 5 million , leading to a surplus of € 1 . 6 million during the first quarter of 2002 . Therefore , the level of the operational budget reserve increased from € 3 . 3 million ( $ 2 . 98 million ) as at 1 January 2002 to € 4 . 9 million as at 31 March 2002 . Regular and operational budgets , 2000-2001 The accounts for the biennium 2000-2001 have been submitted for audit to the External Auditor . In accordance with legislative mandates , the report of the External Auditor , financial performance report and programme performance report for the biennium 2000-2001 will be submitted to the twenty-sixth session of the Board through the Programme and Budget Committee . The overall implementation of the regular budget for the last biennium was 96.4 per cent , resulting in a provisional surplus of $ 4 , 248 , 200 , which represents 3.6 per cent of the restated appropriations after applying the adjustment formula shown in the GC . 8 / Dec. 17 to take account of the average exchange rate actually experienced during the biennium . This implementation compares favourably with the last four bienniums ( 1998-1999 : 91.7 per cent ; 1996-1997 : 80.7 per cent ; 1994-1995 : 88.3 per cent ; 1992-1993 : 94.5 per cent ) . The higher implementation of the biennium 2000-2001 is due to the favourable cash position of the Organization , which , inter alia , has resulted from a better collection rate of both current and prior years ' assessed contributions . The programme support cost income of the operational budget for the biennium amounted to $ 18 . 65 million , with expenditures of $ 17 . 29 million . As a result , the operational budget recorded a surplus of $ 1 . 36 million . The reserve level thus increased from $ 1 . 62 million on 1 January 2000 to $ 2 . 98 million as at 31 December 2001 . Technical cooperation delivery during 2001 amounted to $ 84 . 7 million . However , should technical services at the programme and project levels of United Nations Development Programme and Industrial Development Decade for Africa supplementary activities be included , the volume of technical services provided by UNIDO during the year totalled more than $ 90 million . Collections A total of 27 Member States , including two least developed countries ( LDCs ) , have made full payments and 20 Member States , including five LDCs , have made partial payments of their assessed contributions for the year 2002 . The collections in the period from January to March 2002 , broken down by Lists of States , are shown in table 1 . Table 1 . Collections , January-March 2002 ( In millions of euros ) * As contained in document GC . 9 / 16 . Outstanding contributions The detailed status of assessed contributions outstanding as at 31 March 2002 is contained in annex I to the present document . The scale of assessment and outstanding contributions as at 31 March 2002 , broken down by Lists of States , are shown in table 2 . Table 2 . Scale of assessment and outstanding contributions , as at 31 March 2002 * As contained in document GC . 9 / 16 . On 6 December 2000 , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia deposited the instrument of accession to the Constitution of UNIDO and thus became a new Member State . As the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist , a decision will have to be taken with regard to the treatment of the arrears of the former Yugoslavia , amounting to € 2 , 084 , 146 . The issue is among the items on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly and document A / 56 / 767 of 9 January 2002 contains details . The Secretariat is closely following further developments and any decision to be taken by the General Assembly in this respect will be conveyed to the UNIDO governing bodies . As indicated in annex I to the present document and as summarized in table 3 , the voting rights of 61 Member States had been suspended as at 31 March 2002 in accordance with Article 5.2 of the Constitution and financial regulation 5.5 ( b ) . Table 3 . Suspension of voting rights , as at 31 March In order to restore their voting rights for the remainder of 2002 , these Member States must pay their full contributions for 1999 and prior years , including advances to the Working Capital Fund , as well as a partial contribution for 2000 . The minimum total amount that would have to be paid by these Member States is € 22 , 259 , 710 . Information was provided in document GC . 9 / 10 of 22 October 2001 on the implementation of the measures recommended by the open-ended discussion group on timely payment of assessed contributions . Since that time one payment plan has been concluded ( with Ukraine , as approved by the General Conference in decision GC . 9 / Dec. 12 ) , and the first instalment under the plan has been received . Informal consultations are continuously taking place with a number of Member States regarding settlement of their arrears through payment plans . As reported in document GC . 9 / 10 , the United States of America owes € 69 , 264 , 731 ( equivalent to $ 61 , 678 , 302 ) , against assessed contributions for the years 1994-1996 and € 953 , 547 ( $ 849 , 107 ) against the Tax Reimbursement Agreement – a total amount of € 70 , 218 , 278 . There has been no further development on the collection of this amount , although the Secretariat has again followed up this year with the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations ( Vienna ) for the settlement of the arrears . PRIATIONS , INCOME FROM NEW MEMBER STATES AND INTEREST INCOME IN EXCESS OF BUDGETARY ESTIMATES Detailed information on the unencumbered balances of appropriations , income from new Member States and interest income in excess of budgetary estimates was provided in document GC . 9 / 10 . The following amounts in euros were due for distribution to eligible Member States ( i . e . those that had fully paid their assessed contributions for the respective biennium ) in accordance with financial regulations 4.2 ( b ) and ( c ) : While adopting the decision on the scale of assessments ( GC . 9 / Dec. 10 ) , the General Conference strongly encouraged Member States to consider renouncing voluntarily their shares of the balances and income referred to above , for the regular budget and / or for technical cooperation activities of UNIDO , and requested the Director-General to report to the Board on the amounts renounced and purposes specified by Member States . From early January 2002 , the Secretariat solicited from Member States their intention as to the utilization of their respective share and requested replies to be returned by 28 February 2002 . Responses received as at 31 March 2002 are shown in annex II and are summarized below . As reported in various documents , including GC . 9 / 10 ( chap . VII ) , UNIDO gradually introduced a new computerized financial performance control system ( FPCS ) during 2000-2001 . After one year of parallel operation of the previous mainframe system and FPCS , UNIDO has been using FPCS as the sole system for all accounting transactions since 1 January 2002 . The parallel operation was helpful in fine-tuning the application and adjusting procedures to make best use of the features offered by the new system . The switch-over coincided with the introduction of the euro as the base currency for UNIDO's accounts . Most of the remaining issues with the new system are related to the requirement of continuing the accounting for technical cooperation activities in United States dollars , whereas the base currency is now the euro . Work will also continue in the area of designing various reports based on transaction data captured by the new system as well as linking it to existing executive management systems . In addition , the application will be rolled out to all staff involved in financial operations for capturing data at the point of origin , and enabling staff to have on-line information on the status of activities for which they are responsible . In accordance with General Conference decision GC . 8 / Dec. 16 , a single currency system of assessment based on the euro became effective with the current fiscal period 2002-2003 . Since the adoption of that decision in 1999 , the Secretariat has kept Member States informed of steps taken for the introduction of the single currency system . Recent action and developments with respect to the transition , as well as issues encountered , are provided as background information in a conference room paper ( IDB . 25 / CRP . 3 ) , and a document on the subject will be issued to the Programme and Budget Committee at its forthcoming eighteenth session . Among the steps taken in compliance with decision GC . 8 / Dec. 16 was the amendment of the concomitant Financial Regulations of UNIDO . A conference room paper containing the updated regulations will be issued under the symbol IDB . 25 / CRP . 4 . The Industrial Development Board may wish to consider adopting the following draft decision : "" The Industrial Development Board : "" ( a ) Takes note of the information provided in document IDB . 25 / 6 ; "" ( b ) Also takes note of the information on the implementation of General Conference decision GC . 9 / Dec. 10 ( IDB . 25 / 6 , chap . VI ) ; "" ( c ) Urges those Member States that have not yet paid their assessed contributions , including advances to the Working Capital Fund and prior years' arrears , to do so without delay . "" Annex I As at 31 March 2002 ( in Euros ) Notes : ( p ) Partial payment . Voting rights of 61 Member States have been suspended in accordance with Article 5.2 of the Constitution of UNIDO . Four Members of the Industrial Development Board are without voting rights : Belarus , Côte d ' Ivoire , Guatemala and Libyan Arab Jamahiriya . The General Conference has approved a payment plan for Ukraine to settle its arrears and its voting right was regained ( GC . 9 / Dec. 12 ) . Outstanding contribution to be resolved following decision by the United Nations General Assembly . Member State of UNIDO until 31 December 1996 . Since 31 March 2002 , full or partial payments were received from the following Member States : Belgium , Côte d ' Ivoire , Cuba , Cyprus , Denmark , Ecuador , Guatemala , Mexico and Oman ( an update will be issued as a conference room paper ) . Annex II STATUS OF UNENCUMBERED BALANCES OF APPROPRIATIONS , INCOME FROM NEW MEMBER STATES AND INTEREST INCOME IN EXCESS OF BUDGETARY ESTIMATES ( GC . 9 / Dec. 10 ) As at 31 March 2002 ( in Euros ) Provides information on the financial situation of UNIDO , including arrears , as at 31 March 2002 . Also refers to the initial experience of the Organization in the transition to a single currency system of assessment . A conference room paper will be issued during the session to provide updated information on the status of assessed contributions , voting rights and disposition of unencumbered balances of appropriations , income from new Member States and interest income in excess of budgetary estimates .

1401	A good way to understand reinforcement learning is to consider some of the examples and possible applications that have guided its development : A master chess player makes a move . The choice is informed both by planning---anticipating possible replies and counter-replies---and by immediate , intuitive judgments of the desirability of particular positions and moves . An adaptive controller adjusts parameters of a petroleum refinery's operation in real time . The controller optimizes the yield / cost / quality tradeoff based on specified marginal costs without sticking strictly to the set points originally suggested by human engineers . A gazelle calf struggles to its feet minutes after being born . Half an hour later it is running at 30 miles per hour . A mobile robot decides whether it should enter a new room in search of more trash to collect or start trying to find its way back to its battery recharging station . It makes its decision based on how quickly and easily it has been able to find the recharger in the past . Phil prepares his breakfast . When closely examined , even this apparently mundane activity reveals itself as a complex web of conditional behavior and interlocking goal-subgoal relationships : walking to the cupboard , opening it , selecting a cereal box , then reaching for , grasping , and retrieving the box . Other complex , tuned , interactive sequences of behavior are required to obtain a bowl , spoon , and milk jug . Each step involves a series of eye movements to obtain information and to guide reaching and locomotion . Rapid judgments are continually made about how to carry the objects or whether it is better to ferry some of them to the dining table before obtaining others . Each step is guided by goals , such as grasping a spoon , or getting to the refrigerator , and is in service of other goals , such as having the spoon to eat with once the cereal is prepared and of ultimately obtaining nourishment . These examples share features that are so basic that they are easy to overlook . All involve interaction between an active decision-making agent and its environment , within which the agent seeks to achieve a goal despite uncertainty about its the environment . The agent's actions are permitted to affect the future state of the environment ( e.g. , the next chess position , the level of reservoirs of the refinery , the next location of the robot ) , thereby affecting the options and opportunities available to the agent at later times . Correct choice requires taking into account indirect , delayed consequences of actions , and thus may require foresight or planning . At the same time , in all these examples the effects of actions can not be fully predicted , and so the agent must frequently monitor its environment and react appropriately . For example , Phil must watch the milk he pours into his cereal bowl to keep it from overflowing . All these examples involve goals that are explicit in the sense that the agent can judge progress toward its goal on the basis of what it can directly sense . The chess player knows whether or not he wins , the refinery controller knows how much petroleum is being produced , the mobile robot knows when its batteries run down , and Phil knows whether or not he is enjoying his breakfast . In all of these examples the agent can use its experience to improve its performance over time . The chess player refines the intuition he uses to evaluate positions , thereby improving his play ; the gazelle calf improves the efficiency with which it can run ; Phil learns to streamline his breakfast making . The knowledge the agent brings to the task at the start---either from previous experience with related tasks or built into it by design or evolution---influences what is useful or easy to learn , but interaction with the environment is essential for adjusting behavior to exploit specific features of the task .	4
656	The first five years of my life were spent on a farm in Surrey . As far as I can remember , it was idyllic . And then my father died and my mother had a sort of breakdown , so my travels began ; I ca n't recall all the people and all the places I was sent to , but wherever I was I would raid the bookcase and read - anything and everything . At six I went to boarding school where I decided I would become a concert pianist . I thought you had to be man to write books , probably because of Rudyard Kipling , R L Stevenson , Charles Dickens and Co. I had n't met Jane Austen or the Brontes . For two years I was frightened of everything and everyone , and then I became bad . When I was sixteen I decided to run away , this took the form of joining a repertory company instead of taking my A-levels . It was heaven . At twenty-one I went to London to seek my fame and fortune on the West-end stage . Nothing happened . So I became a Governess in Italy . The boys I was supposed to be teaching were bigger than I was , they educated me instead . When I returned to Britain I joined the BBC as a photographic researcher , then worked my way up to Floor Manager in the News Department and finally a Director / Editor for children's television . My producer told me I should write my own books but I did n't think I was good enough . One day I met a Welsh painter , whom I eventually married . My husband inherited an old watermill in Powys , so we came to Wales and had three children who are all bilingual . They taught me to write real stories for children , and then they grew up and went to Rome , Edinburgh and the World . But they still help me to write my books . AuthorZone 2 - September 2000 .	1

863	Is Jennie Bristow serious , or is she just ignorant ? ( Commissioned responses , 27 February ) The problems associated with nuclear power are many and deep . Contrary to the claim in the 1950s that it would produce power ' too cheap to meter ' , it is one of the most expensive sources . Only gigantic public subsidy has masked the true cost . Let renewables have an equal chance - and give them the same decades of expensive research and development - and we will see nuclear dismissed as a no-hoper . Nuclear power is also nearly as dirty as coal and oil . The waste it produces will not lose its lethal toxicity for tens of thousands of years . What a legacy . And one of the greatest advantages of renewables is that they do n't start wars over energy sources , because it is free and all around us .	0

1084	"Smarter Survey Results and Impact : Abandon the Asker-Puker Model ! Today's post comes from a source of deep pain . Analysis Ninjas are valued less than I would prefer for them to be . The post is also sourced from a recent edition of my newsletter , The Marketing – Analytics Intersect . I send it once a week , and it contains my insights and recommendations on those two topics . Like this blog , the newsletter is geared towards being instantly actionable ( rather than just theory-smart , which is pretty cool too ) . Do sign up if you want to deliver a small electric shock of simulation to your brain each week . TMAI # 41 covered a graph that resulted from a survey done by Econsultancy and Lynchpin . I received a ton of responses for it , and great discussion ensued . It prompted me to write this post , essentially an expanded version of TMAI # 41 . I 've added new insights , recommendations , and two bonus lessons on how to do surveys better and a direct challenge to your company's current analytics strategy . If your heart is weak , you can stop reading now . I promise , I wo n't mind one bit . I heart you . If you are open to being challenged ... then here are the short-stories inside this post ... Some of you know that I created the phrases Reporting Squirrels and Analysis Ninjas to emphasize the difference between those that puke data and those that puke insights with actions attached to them . Here is my slide the first time I presented the concept in a keynote ... Cute , right ? : ) While companies , medium and large , often need both roles , I 've massively pushed for every company to want more Analysis Ninjas and for analysts to have careers where they can rapidly undertake metamorphosis from Reporting Squirrels to Analysis Ninjas ( after all the difference in salary is tens of thousands of dollars ) . With that as context , you can imagine how heart-broken I was when Jane shared the following visual from a study done by Econsultancy and Lynchpin . It contains the answers to the question which analytics skills are most in demand ... Checkout the y-axis ... what do you see as the common pattern across them all ? Just data puking . One row after another of data puking skills . Ranked . Almost nothing that quite captures the value of Analysis Ninjas ! N. O. T. H. I. N. G. I did a random Google search and got this list of analytical skills : + Understanding relationships between numbers + Interpreting mathematical information + Visual perception of information + Ability to organize information + Pattern recognition and understanding trends + Argumentation and logical thinking + Ability to create insightful data visualizations + Hypothesis development and design of experimentation + Strategic thinking skills And , that is just a random list ! None of these are in demand ? Look at the list in the graph , what kind of purple squirrel with ant legs and an elephant's nose that nobody needs is Lynchpin describing ? This did not happen at Econsultancy , but the data did cause introspection at my end . And , my first question was the one that is also top of mind of all readers of Occam's Razor ... Is the world so dark that the only "" analytical "" skills that are valued are directly tied to data puking and you should immediately shut down your Analysis Ninja efforts ? Let me share three thoughts for your consideration , then some guidance on how to do surveys right , and end with a call to arms for all of you and the "" data people "" you choose to work with . Three thoughts that explain the Econsultancy / Lynchpin graph . 1 . The survey design is at fault . The otherwise well-respected Econsultancy and Lynchpin dropped the ball massively in creating the list of answers for the respondents to choose from . I have to admit , I believe this is a major flaw ( and not just for this question in the entire report ) . What is disappointing is that they have done this for nine years in a row ! It poses these questions ... How is it that in nine years no one at these organizations realized they were simply asking people to rank data puking answers ? Did the survey list the skills Econsultancy and Lynchpin hire for and value in their own analysts ? The graph illustrates data for three years ... Was the fact that almost nothing changed in three years in terms of priority not trigger a rethink of the options provided for this question ? Anyone reading the report at the two companies creating it should have thrown a red flag up and said hey guys , the respondents keep rating the answers the same , maybe we are not asking the right question or providing the best choices for our respondents to pick . More on how to avoid this flaw in your surveys , of any kind , below . 2 . The survey is targeted to the wrong folks . They might be the wrong folks to accurately judge what analytical skills and how to appreciate the value of each skill as they rank them . That could explain the results ( not the answer choices though ) . Econsultancy / Lynchpin provides this description in the report : "" There were 960 respondents to our research request , which took the form of a global online survey fielded in May and June 2016 . Respondents included both in-house digital professionals and analysts ( 56 % ) and supply-side respondents , including agencies , consultants and vendors ( 44 % ) . "" The survey was 76 % from the UK and EU . Respondents were solicited from each company's database as well as Social Media . Here is the distribution provided in the report : On paper it looks like the departments are to be what you would expect . It is difficult to ascribe any blame to the folks who got the survey . There is a chance that there is a UK and EU nuance here , but I do n't think so . 3 . It is our fault . My first instinct in these cases is to look into the mirror . Perhaps we have not succeeded as much as we should when it comes to show casing the value of true data analysis . Perhaps all the people involved in all digital analytics jobs / initiatives , inside and outside companies , are primarily data pukers , and none of them have skills to teach companies that there is such a thing as data analysis that is better . Then , you and I , and especially our friends in UK and EU , need to work harder to prove to companies that CDPs ( customized data pukes , my name for reporting ) do not add much value , the rain of data does not drive much action . You and I need to truly move to the IABI model were we send very little data , and what little we send out is sent with copious amounts of Insights from the data , what Actions leaders need to take , and the computation of the Business Impact . The more we deliver IABI , by using our copious analytical skills , the more the leaders will start to recognize what real analytical skills are and be able to separate between Reporting Squirrels and Analysis Ninjas . Bottom-line ... I would like to blame the competency at Econsultancy and Lynchpin , especially because I believe that truly , but I must take some responsibility on behalf of the Analysis Ninjas of the world . Perhaps we suck more than we would like to admit . I mean that sincerely . Bonus # 1 : Lessons from Econsultancy / Lynchpin Survey Strategy . There are a small clump of lessons from my practice in collecting qualitative feedback that came to fore in thinking about this particular survey . Let me share those with you , they cover challenges that surely the E + L team faced as they put this initiative together . If your survey has questions that cease to be relevant , should you ask them again for the sale of consistency as you have done this survey for nine years ? There is a huge amount of pressure for repeated surveys to keep the questions the same because Survey Data Providers love to show time trends – month over month , year over year . It might seem silly that you would keep asking a question when you know it is not relevant , but there is pressure . This is even worse when it comes to answer choices . Survey Creators love having stability and being able to show how things have changed , and they keep irrelevant / awful / dead answers around . If you are in this position ... You will be brave , you will be a warrior , you will be the lone against-the-tide-swimmer , and you will slay non-value-added stuff ruthlessly . You will burn for from the ashes shall rise glory . If you are the Big Boss of such an initiative , here is a simple incentive to create , especially for digital-anything surveys : Give your team a standard goal that 30 % of the survey questions for any survey repeated each year have to be eliminated and 10 % new ones added . Your permission will 1 . force your employees to think hard about what to keep and what to kill ( imagine that , thinking ! ) 2 . create a great and fun culture in your analytical ( or reporting : ( ) team and 3 . push them to know of the latest and greatest and include that in the survey . If I feel I have a collection of terrible choices , do you have a strategy for how I can identify that ? This does not work for all questions of course , but here is one of my favourite choice in cases where the questions relate to organizations , people skills , and other such elements . Take this as an example ... How do you know that this is a profoundly sub-optimal collection of choices to provide ? For anyone with even the remotest amount of relevant experience , subject matter expertise , it is easy to see these are crazy choices – essentially implying purple squirrels exist . But , how would you know ? Simple . Start writing down how many different roles are represented in the list . That is just what I did ... It turns out there are at least five roles in a normal company that would possess these skills . So . Is this a good collection of skills to list ? Without that relevant information ? If you still go ahead and ask this question , what are you patterning your audience to look for / understand ? Oh , and I am still not over that in looking for what analysis skills are missing in the company , no actual analytical skills are listed above ! Ok , maybe statistical modeling smells like an analytical skill . But , that 's as close as it gets . I share this simple strategy , identifying the number of different roles this represents , to help you illuminate you might have a sub-optimal collection of choices . There are many other strategies like this one for other question . Look for them ! If your survey respondents are not the ideal audience for a question , what 's your job when crafting the survey ? J. K. I. Just kill it . If you do n't want to kill it ... Personally interview a random sample of 50 people personally ( for a 1,000 people survey ) . Take 10 mins each . Ask primitive basic questions about their job , their actual real work ( not job title ) , and their approximate knowledge . If these 50 pass the sniff test , send the survey . Else , know that your survey stinks . JKI . I know that I am putting an onerous burden on the survey company , taking to 50 people even for 10 mins comes at a cost . It does . I am empathetic to it . Consider it the cost of not putting smelly stuff out into the world . If your survey respondents wo n't be able to answer a question perfectly , what is a great strategy for crafting questions ? Oh , oh , oh , I love this problem . It happens all the time . You as the survey creator do n't know what you are taking about , the audience does not quite know what they are talking about , but there is something you both want to know / say . Here 's the solution : Do n't do drop down answers or radio button answers ! The first couple times you do this , ask open ended questions . What analytical skills do you think you need in your company ? Let them type out in their own words what they want . Then find a relatively smart person with subject matter expertise , give them a good salary and a case of Red Bull , and ask them to categorize . It will be eye opening . The results will improve your understanding and now you 'll have a stronger assessment of what you are playing with , and the audience will not feel boxed in by your choices , instead tell you how they see the answers . ( Maybe , just maybe be , they 'll give you my list of analytical skills above ! ) Then run the survey for a couple years with the choices from above . In year four , go back to the open text strategy . Get new ideas . Get smarter . Rinse . Repeat . I would like to think I know all the answers in the world . Hubris . I use the strategy above to become knowledgeable about the facts on the ground and then use those facts ( on occasion complemented by one or two of my choices ) to run the survey . This rule is great for all kinds of surveys , always start with open-text . It is harder . But that is what being a brave warrior of knowledge is all about ! If your survey results cause your senior executives , or random folks on the web , to question them , what is the best response ? The instinct to close in an be defensive , to even counter-attack , is strong . As I 'm sure your mom's taught you : Resist . Truly listen . Understand the higher order bit . Evolve . Then let your smarter walk do the talking . Simple . Awfully hard to do . Still . Simple . Bonus # 2 : The Askers-Pukers Business Model . The biggest thing a report like Econsultancy / Lynchpin's suffers from is that this group of individuals , perhaps even both these companies , see their role in this initiative as Askers-Pukers . It is defined as : Let us go ask a 960 people we can find amongst our customers and on social media a series of questions , convert that into tables and graphs , and sell it to the world . Ask questions . Puke data . That is all there is in the report . Download the sample report if you do n't have a paid Econsultancy subscription . If you do n't want to use your email address , use this wonderful service : www.throwawaymail.com Even if you set aside the surveying methodology , the questions framing , the answer choices and all else , there is negative value from anything you get from Askers-Pukers , because the totality of the interpretation of the data is writing in text what the graphs / tables already show or extremely generic text . Negative value also because you are giving money for the report that is value-deficient , and you are investing time in reading it to try and figure out something valuable . You lose twice . Instead one would hope that Econsultancy , Lynchpin , the team you interact with from Google , your internal analytics team , any human you interact who has data sees their role as IABI providers ( Insights – Actions – Business Impact ) . This is the process IABI providers follow : Ask questions . Analyze it for why the trends in the data exist ( Insights ) . Identify what a company can / should do based on the why ( Actions ) . Then , have the courage , and the analytical chops , to predict how much the impact will be on the company's business if they do what was recommended . Insights . Actions . Business Impact . Perhaps the fatal flaw in my analysis above , my hope above , is that I expected Econsultancy and Lynchpin to be really good at business strategy , industry knowledge , on the ground understanding of patterns with their massive collection of clients . Hence , knowing what actually works . I expected them to be Analysts . Instead , they perhaps limit their skills inside the respective company to be Askers-Pukers . Both companies are doing extremely well financially , hence I do appreciate that Askers-Pukers model does work . But for you , and for me , and for anyone else you are paying a single cent for when it comes to data – either data reported from a survey , data reported from your digital analytics tool , data reported from other companies you work with like Facebook or Google or GE – demand IABI . Why . What . How Much . If they do n't have that , you are talking to the wrong people . Press the escape button , do n't press the submit order button . [ Is n't it ironic . Econsultancy and Lynchpin did exactly what their survey has shown for nine years is not working for companies in the UK : Reporting . The outcome for both of them is exactly the same as the outcome for the companies : Nothing valuable . This is explicitly demonstrated by their full report . ] Bottom-line . I hope you see that this one survey is not the point . E + L are not the point . What their work in this specific example ( and you should check other examples if you pay either company money ) illuminates is a common problem that is stifling our efforts in the analytics business . This applies to E + L but it applies even more to your internal analytics team , it applies extremely to the consultants you hire , it applies to anyone you are giving a single cent to when it comes to data . Do n't hire Askers-Pukers . Do n't repeat things for years without constantly stress-testing for reality . Do n't make compromises when you do surveys or mine Adobe for data . Do n't create pretty charts without seeing , really looking with your eyes , what is on the chart and thinking about what it really represents . Applied to your own job inside any company , using Google Analytics or Adobe or iPerceptions or Compete or any other tool ... do n't be an Asker-Puker yourself . Be an IABI provider . That is where the money is . That is where the love is . That is where the glory is . Carpe Diem ! As always , it is your turn now . Is your company hiring Reporting Squirrels or Analysis Ninjas ? Why ? Is the work you are doing at your company / agency / consulting entity / survey data provider , truly Analysis Ninja work ? If not , why is it that it remains an Asker-Puker role ? Are there skills you 've developed in your career to shift to the person whose business is why , what , how much ? Lastly , when you do surveys , of the type above or others , are there favourite strategies you deploy to get a stronger signal rather than just strong noise ? Please share your life lessons from the front lines , critique , praise , fun-facts and valuable guidance for me and other readers via comments . Thank you . Merci . Arigato . PS : I hope this post illuminates the valuable content The Marketing – Analytics Intersect shares each week , sign up here . Comments Just this second your newsletter ended up in my inbox and I had to comment on it . Askers-pukers model is really one of the greatest things I 've read recently . I was just in discussion how I hate the skyscraper content method that led to all those "" 10 things you need to .. "" , "" 15 things you need to .. "" , "" 20 things .... "" you know .. and then this came in . Because I hate these "" Empirically looking nonsense reports "" just as much . The best thing is the hidden irony between dealing with Analytic Skills whilst showing not even a hint of it themselves . Asker puked model is interesting .. first time ever heard of it . Kidding . While the name is new , we are surrounded by Analysts and Agencies who practice this model . As they realize that revenue is not in this model for them or their clients hopefully they will take your advice to morph into IABI providers . Avinash – I read this , then read it again . I did n't know whether to laugh or cry . Thank you for not only pointing out some of the weaknesses but also suggesting some positive things to improve matters . These are the real learnings for me . Keep em coming . We have to remember that every generation is being exposed to exponentially more data and the tools to assist in understanding lag . More important we do n't teach this kind of critical thinking to nearly enough people . We are still very early in a huge journey and much like DTP was in the 1980s you can use good tools and produce bad work . It takes time to develop the appreciation of how to make a difference with all this new data . Peter : I concur with you about the speed and quantity of change that is happening . It is a bit crazy . I hope this is taken by vendors , consultants , and internal Analysis Ninjas as a call to arms to invest regularly in self-development . It is so very easy in this industry to become stale . It use to take 20 years , it takes less than 2 now . This is 100 % true . But I was wondering : is it possible that the very structure of businesses cause the phenomenon of data puking ? I mean , assuming that most people are actively seeking promotions , the only way for them to prove their points and to elevate in the hierarchy is to generate reports validating their hypotheses and proving that they were right in the first place . I would suggest that such a bias does not lead to greater insights , but to data pukes , as you described so well . Benoit : Yes , the way modern orgs function they do incentivize lots of data puking . There is a mistaken belief that just access to data is enough to make smarter decisions . No , what you are describing as requirement for promotions is analysis , and analysis is good . Sadly , though most of the time people just get loads of data , due to lack of skills or training they are unable to convert that data into analysis which results in fewer promotions . I continue to be amazed at your ability to identify structural gaps in thinking from just one slide . One element that might be unique to you is that you get outraged when you see bad things , while most people rarely are passionate enough to give it a second glance . That is a lesson I 'll take with me from your post . Continue to point out these issues and push the industry forward . You wrote a lot to make a simple point . The survey was extremely poorly done with little thought to the audience and topic being measured . Tracking surveys makes sense when the kpi 's being measured are in fact consistent ( e.g. , brand awareness ) . The Researchers failed to recognize the skills of an ' analyst ' are not consistent over time or universal across industries and geography . But the point that people need to think crtically about what analysts do or should do within their organization is well taken . On survey strategies , there have been many a good book written on the subject of ( marketing ) research surveys that hardly need a rehash here . Avinash , thanks for the article . I think business is evolving . I think organizations are at the beginning of the journey on how to use the data they emit . I appreciate the inspiration . Thanks for putting your thoughts and feedback into the public domain – I could definitely feel my ears privately burning on the edge of the Marketing – Analytics Intersect last week ! We do put our Lynchpin name to this survey – by way of sponsorship rather than overall authorship I should emphasise – which makes us absolutely open to challenge by association . For the avoidance of doubt ( and rumour of unloved / unwanted weird squirrel / elephant / ant hybrids occupying Lynchpin towers ) I definitely agree that companies should seek out analysts with fundamental traits around numeracy , pattern recognition , communication , commercial awareness , hypothesis development , strategic thinking and so on . In blunt terms , I think the idea of your world view being substantially different to that presented in the survey report and / or the industry reality is perhaps overstated . You cite IABA as the model to aspire to ( "" Be an IABI provider . That is where the money is . That is where the love is . That is where the glory is . "" ) . I 'm certainly not disagreeing with that aspiration , but I 'd simply call IABA as you describe it "" good reporting "" . OK , really good reporting , fantastically tailored to the audience in terms of granularity and context and so on . But still , ultimately , the end product is : a report . So I can agree that bad reports = data puking and good reports = insight puking . Maybe less puking would be good overall . But I 'm not sure the reporting squirrel ( "" loser "" ? ) / analytics ninja ( "" winner "" ? ) differentiation is always a helpful reference point from an organisational perspective or a career development plan . We had an interesting panel discussion when the survey was first published ( with people that run internal analytics teams for large companies on the panel , not a bunch of consultants ) , and a lot of the discussion focused around how information is communicated around the organisation and carefully managing the interactions with stakeholders involved to drive success . I appreciate stakeholder management is a fairly corporate / bullshit term , but it 's far from "" data puking "" and increasingly what I hear VP's ( or UK equivalent ) seeking in their analytics teams . I like your "" sniff test "" analogy . I promise you those phrases in the offensive graphs would not be in the survey if we were n't hearing them consistently from people that hold budgets describing what they think they need from their analytics functions . You rightly classify them into multiple roles . We were deliberately looking to show the breadth of expectation set upon "" analytics teams "" and "" analyst roles "" by businesses ( please fix the TMS , please present to the board , please predict our sales for next year , please tell us something useful / interesting about our customers , please help us understand what our objectives are ) rather than suggesting a one person frankenstein monster exists . That said , 3 years ago statistical modelling was the least recognised skill-gap . Now it is the most recognised . I think that 's perhaps still relevant as a trend for budding squirrels on this exciting intersection to understand . There is a lot more in your comment and you have absolutely carried me with you with other things you mention . I am deeply grateful for the food for thought you 've provided . I 'll humbly push back on the idea that IABI is reporting . It is not . Reporting it producing a report or a chart – a clever one , a pretty one , a necessary one ( in most modern corporations , there is no escape from reporting ) . My definition of insights , and the thing that my students are learning at Market Motive and the thing that my large team at my employer uses , is why the thing that you see in the chart / table happened . A mix of deep dive analysis and business analysis . My definition of actions are the things that a client should do . A mix of business strategy and competitive analysis . The output is words in English ( or Urdu or Hebrew or Mandarin ) . My definition of business impact is how much a brand or performance KPI will move if aforementioned action is accomplished . The output is one number , mentioned next to each line of English / Urdu . 75 % of the above is not reporting , neither will it come from your Google Analytics account , your Micro-Strategy BI tool account etc. etc. It comes from a human's ability to dig and understand business strategy and relationships with Sr. Leaders . I think of that as output of analysis : IABI . No reporting I have ever seen has ever had the three elements above . At it 's very best , as you also saw in the Econsultancy report , "" really good reporting "" repeats in text what the report ( CDP ) shows . I hope I can carry you with me in the difference between reporting and analysis . Hi Avinash , I am really happy that you wrote a post about this issue . You are a true crusader . we owe you a lot . One confession to make – I get all your new posts through email . Basically , I do n't read the whole post at that time . I come back later when I have some quite time . For my visit to not considered as bounced , I just click on any link before leaving the site : ) . I know 1 visit with bounce is n't going to change anything but I just do n't want to disappoint you . I really feel bad and week for doing this . But I also think that It is my love and respect to you and all the hard work you put into Occam's Razor that I ca n't possibly disappoint you . And one more thing , waiting very patiently for your next book "" Web analytics 3.0 "" . Bhola : You are kind , but you should not worry about Bounce Rate for this blog . I use the strategy I recommend everyone follow ... I only measure Bounce Rate for New Visitors . For Returning , I know that most will read the latest post , and that is ok ! I do love it when they share their experience via comments , it helps everyone . So , thank you . In fact you should not be worried about bounce rate for new visitors too . Your articles are so thought-provoking , and also lengthy , that often users would take time to read and digest it . Maybe you should just look at conversion of new visitors into returning , and ensure that the "" tl ; dr "" audience is less . This reflects what I see in the marketplace . Businesses want outcomes but hire staff based on outputs . Econsultancy's list looks like an employment posting , just a long list of outputs . As long as the squirrels are managed by people that know the outcomes they 're after , is there a problem ? Greg : This is a real problem , as in it is real and it is a problem ! Part of the responsibility falls on the current leadership at companies ( in pretty much any country ) that do not truly value digital , and in turn have lax management of it relying on their gut or sub-optimal metrics . This sounds lame , it is 2016 after all . But , it is sadly true . Now you know where those job descriptions come from . Part of the responsibility , as I mentioned in # 3 in this post , falls on us , the data people . We spend so much time gathering data , conflate sexier javascript tags with accomplishment , and only have time left over to data puke . We have to change this , else the job descriptions wo n't change . We found that when trying to identify issues or areas of concerns , we wrote queries to identify the Top 25 Negative Noun Tokens in Sentences and include the related sentences after Natural Language Processing . We then grouped those sentences for tagging in an interactive tree ( tree of sentences ) . We were able to identify the top issues affecting consumers , very quickly ; because of the refined sample size ( Top 25 Tokens ) . We would repeat this effort with each week of new data ... slowly becoming the knowledge experts in the source domain . As the unique issues started to dry up we instituted a dynamic filtering system where every keyword in a sentence became a filter . We could shuffle the results with each click , spinning the results . We also implemented the ability to combine those keywords and flip them for even more complex dynamic filters . And then we also started an automatic favourite keyword identification system so that on subsequent weeks of results , I knew which keywords / favs were able to pull back the targeted results we were after . So for those looking to find the top negative issues , this may be a plan of attack in the identification of issues , something you could include in your own system or check out text-analyzer.com to see this in action . Hope this helps someone when the uniqueness in the results seems to dry up . Very thought-provoking ! The reporting vs. analysis issue clearly stands out as THE challenge at the company I work at , in terms of data use . The current trends of "" big data "" and "" lean analytics "" make this old issue very poignant . I wonder about your push for metamorphosing squirrels into ninjas . Is that a natural progression ? Is it the only progression ? The best progression ? You note the importance of posing the right questions the right way with the right people in survey development . Asking open-ended questions to develop the right survey response selections is just one example that highlights the importance of developing good tactical approaches when developing data . You nicely tie in the importance of strategic analysis – the ' why ' question in IABI , which provides fodder for hypothesis development in Lean Analytics . This is a call for thinking about analytics as an expression of human behavior , motivation , and thinking . Changing human behavior is the implicit outcome of all the data analysis , and I like how you draw these connections . I 'm a user experience researcher with a background in experimental psychology . I ca n't help but wonder if a reverse transition , from understanding human behavior into data analytics , could also work , and perhaps provide an even easier metamorphosis . If we place Analysis Ninja at the top of the value pyramid , then it will require a person who has one foot firmly planted in both data and human behavior . Michael : There are a lot of wonderful elements to your comment , thank you for sharing your thoughts . Let me touch on a couple . There is a difference between small and big companies . Small companies need someone as close to an Analysis Ninja as possible , and it would be great if the person can also operate machinery and do marketing . Small companies ca n't afford a lot . : ) Reporting Squirrels at small companies are actively harmful , not only can they drive little change , an investment in them might have an expensive opportunity cost . In big companies , you will , for the next five years or so , need Reporting Squirrels and Analysis Ninjas . Part of the need for Reporting Squirrels is being driven by the fact that big companies simply can not do without the silly charade of data being puked left , right and center . Part of it is that there are some orgs where super-tactical decisions can be made by people in the division , and they just need CDPs more efficiently delivered . More companies are realizing they need Analysis Ninajs because efficient , real-time CDPs are simply not working . From Reporting Squirrel to an Analysis Ninja is not a natural progression . It happens 20 % of the time , but analytical skills are so different than what reporting jobs mandate . It is important to note that Reporting Squirrel is a well paid job , and for many they like the comfort of what the job demands are . Hence , it is a fabulous job if it fits your personality profile , skills and professional goals . To your note on users ... I believe , most especially for digital , we have access to so much quant and qual human behavior data , skills in User Experience Research ( UCD , HCI etc. ) would be immensely valuable to an Analysis Ninja . A lot of market-researchers do not have much appreciation for customer behavior methods , and they end up becoming askers-pukers . A smart marketer at times may not even need too much data , but just some intelligent customer behavior analysis methods and hypotheses to come up insights that will win the game for her ."	1

1621	"The Unlimited All-Stars was originally created in 1990 to preserve the then dwindling open classes on the dirt tracks in Western Pennsylvania . For quite a while , the Unlimited All-Stars concept was only applied there . In 2001 the concept was tested on tracks in Florida . As a result of success there it later spread to Arizona , Georgia and the Carolinas . It has continued to grow , and as of the beginning of the 2012 season , there are at least 21 officially recognized circuits across the country , and more are sure to come . To read the complete history of the Unlimited All-Stars concept click on "" History "" in the directory above . The Unlimited All-Stars ( UAS ) is a national club that represents a single class or division for kart racing that combines a wide variety of engine types . Those engines are limited only by their maximum displacement ; otherwise there are virtually no limits to permissible modifications . The class was developed primarily for competition on short dirt oval tracks although the rules have been applied successfully on other tracks as well . Obviously , karts such as these are capable of a very high level of performance and therefore the class is intended only for experienced drivers who have proven themselves capable of safely competing in a sportsman like manner . Due to its nature , the Unlimited All-Stars is not a class that everyone will want to participate in ; it 's definitely not intended for everyone . Racers who are eager to try new and sometimes radical technical ideas feel right at home in the UAS . The rules contain a set of parameters , and emphasize safety but were intentionally written to allow and encourage innovation . No matter what class other racers participate in , they all head for the fence and bleachers when UAS guys fire up their engines . It is the kart division that has the potential to fill the stands with ticket buying fans . Recognizing what appears to be a strangle hold that some manufacturers appear to have over many karting organizations , the UAS refuses to adopt any rule or policy that mandates that any particular brand of product be used by participants . Ingenuity / Camaraderie / Sportsmanship Above all , karting is supposed to be fun , not just for the winner but for everyone who participates . Sportsmanship is the hallmark of the UAS . Of course winning , even dominating the competition is indeed the goal , but in the UAS there is no honor in winning if the winner's competitors despise him or her . The attitude of a true UAS competitor will not allow him to take advantage of a "" cheap shot "" to advance in position because just as important as winning is , it is the camaraderie with fellow competitors that keeps them coming back , race after race . It is demanded that track officials are especially firm with UAS competitors and they are to use the black flag when it is called for . UAS regional administrators are expected to communicate with drivers who may not be driving in an acceptable manner and coach them to improve . They are also expected to promote a high level of camaraderie among their members . There are many successful racers in other divisions who had lost the challenge and thrill that kart racing once provided them . The UAS , with the innovation that it allows and encourages , has renewed their interest in kart racing . The UAS , as an organization , does not usually promote events on their own , rather they work with promoters who see the promotional value of the UAS to organize events . By UAS policy , individual promoters have the ultimate responsibility of administering events . When the UAS drivers are placed on the card for an event , they are the guests of that particular race track . With the exception of post race technical inspection the UAS does not typically provide any race officials . The Unlimited All-Stars provides the promoter with a suggested set of policies and rules , negotiates pay-offs , schedules races , provides recognition for participants and publicizes events . In essence , the UAS was originally set-up as a representative primarily for drivers and race teams . Awards and Recognition One of the primary functions of the Unlimited All-Stars is to establish a central contact point for managing the affairs of the UAS participants . In 2007 a National Ranking system was put into place to allow UAS racers from across the country to see how they measure up in relationship to their peers . In 2008 drivers who wished to be included in the national ranking system were required to become UAS members . This allowed an awards fund to be established to provide prizes and recognition for the members . In 2010 a new point system was established that included a national season concluding Grand National event that racers wishing to aspire to the National Champion title must compete in . Please post this to any forums you may frequent . Please be aware that nominations must be made on this facebook page or by e-mail . We will not be monitoring all of the different forums where this may wind up ."	4
1162	"Economics and prostitution The word "" prostitution "" has always confused the minds of people for years . Constant attempts to solve this existing problem have not really given any positive results . For some time the problem was obviously ignored by the government as if it completely did not know what to do with it . In the beginning of the XXI century a prostitute has become one of the most ordinary goods that the market can offer . It is also necessary to mention that the demand on prostitution is constantly growing due to several factors worth of separate analysis . Prostitution has always been "" covered "" from the eyes of citizens as is has always been unacceptable . Nevertheless , the problem does not disappear and in fact it becomes even more "" sharp "" with time . Of course it is easier to pretend like there is no enormous amount of women and men that have no other way to survive but offering sexual services . Basically , the Law of Canada has not done anything good enough to solve the problem in any way , except causing vagueness in the understanding of what is legal and illegal in terms of sexual services . Prostitution has a lot to do with the economy , as it is not only its "" dark "" side but also the potential legal income , which is always needed so much . So what is prostitution ? Does it need economical stimulation or should it be completely prohibited or ignored ? And should the economical approach be used to prostitution at all ? Prostitution is not and will never be a standard job and this is something that is to be never forgotten . Choosing prostitution as a "" career "" opportunity ? The most horrifying thing about prostitution is that it has become not just a way to make money for starving and homeless people but also a "" career "" opportunity for the young generation . Why do our children have to grow up with the notion that prostitution is a source of getting money and surviving in this world ? The contemporary world lives under certain regularities . A man has to get a job that will provide him or her with a sufficient amount of money in order to maintain a normal living . So if a person does not have enough knowledge to get this or that job he or she always has another opportunity - to prostitute himself or herself . Prostitution as a primitive was of making money ; it is a problem that prevents the society from its perfection and development . Prostitution is obviously a negative phenomenon , demoralizing the society but is has actually become a "" job "" for many men and women and this fact can not remain unnoticed . Definition of prostitution Prostitution does exist and it an unchallengeable fact . It existed since ancient times in different countries , with different social-political statuses . A prostitute is a person who provides sexual services in exchange for money . In other words it is a person who offers sex and gets paid for it . Nevertheless , none of the people providing this type of services are performing a business activity . It is usually believed that prostitutes are women ; nevertheless men play an important part in prostitution as an object of high demand , too . Anyhow it is very hard to give a definition to prostitution as a profession , because prostitutes do not pay taxes and do not receive any pension while on retirement . Prostitution is not illegal in Canada and this fact puts it in a very uncertain position in terms of possible "" career opportunities "" for the young generation . It is legal to sell services but it is illegal to buy them – this statement makes many people bewildered . One thing is certain for sure : prostitution – is an act of selling a person's body for further sexual services for material compensation . Danger of the oldest profession Choosing prostitution as a profession is not rational . Yes , it does bring income and the demand is always high . But what will a prostitute remain with at the threshold of the pension age ? This is one of the reasons that many people such as the criminologist Dr. John Lowman argue in favor of its legalization1 . Prostitution is considered as a potential source of renewing the budget of Canada . But there are also other reasons for not becoming a prostitute except the tax-pension side of the issue . Many of the prostitutes simply disappear and often become the victims of violence . According to the statistics "" 90 percent had been physically assaulted in prostitution and 78 percent had been raped in prostitution "" 2 . Prostitutes do not get the protection the representatives of standard professions do . They can also be the cause of spreading of venereal diseases due to the fact of absence of a proper medical checkup . This "" dangers "" put prostitution in the position of the "" risk zone "" occupation . No one will argue that choosing an occupation with high risks is not rational at all . Economical approach to prostitution Prostitution is legal in Canada . But it is only formally , because "" pimping and operating or being found in or working in a "" bawdy house "" ( every place where one or more prostitutes regularly work or where "" indecent acts "" are performed ) are not "" 3 . Criminal Code sections 210 and 211 forbid "" Bawdy houses "" and section 212 foresees responsibility for living on the avails of the prostitution of a person . How should the economical approach be applied to prostitution ? Canada's Justice has put prostitution in a position where is has to be done in certain places without any publicity or in other words it has to respect the moral abutments of the society . If prostitution is to be viewed as a type of "" profession "" than it is put on the same level with other taxpayers such as teachers , lawyers and many others . The application of the economical approach means that prostitution has to have a legal status . SO this makes us view prostitution as a business . A business activity is an independent activity directed to a systematic income arrival from property use , selling goods , work execution or rendering services registered and stated by Law . So prostitution is a systematic income obtained from rendering a service . Prostitution gets the possibility to exist illegally from the gaps in the Law and the Canadian Law with its semi-legalization does not make it easier to define the status of prostitution in the country . If prostitution is legal than prostitutes have to be 18 years old and have the right to medical and social security . At the same time they have to pay the monthly income tax , which will make the profession less profitable , then it is now . Prostitution and economy . The existance of prostitution in Canada still can be explained form the point of the economic approach for Canada has a market-based economy . According to the economic approach both of the sides have to be in profit . Demand gives birth to supply and in this terms prostitution is just the reaction of the high demand of sexual services . So it is about the morality of the society in the first place . Third parties should be completely eliminated from this "" deal "" . These third parties , known as "" pimps "" or even sex-firms are the ones to be persecuted . Sex-workers have become an integral part of Canada's society and they even form alliances such as the Sex Worker's Alliance of Vancouver . The amount of money obtained from prostitution is enormous , so therefore the budget is left without any additional financing . There are only two ways out – either to completely legalize it eliminating street prostitution or to completely forbid it . Prostitution has increased in the last years in Canada . This has a lot to do with the sex-tourists arriving to Canada searching for sexual services . This means that Canada is getting foreign "" deposits "" that go to "" nowhere "" . Prostitution can be found in Canada 's every corner and especially in its main cities4 . Its existance is conditioned by many factors . Canada is offering licensed sex but for some reason the gaps in the law enforcements are so big that it is completely impossible to notice them . In many cases prostitution is the only option of a person and the reaction of the government should not be through the legalization of this option but in the creation of other options of decent money making . The economic approach explains the existance of prostitution because any country is a big market place and is interested in profit in the first place and Canada in not an exception . "" The communicating law "" is not effective anymore . Prostitution needs to be analyzed from every single side and needs a new conception of functioning if functioning at all . The economic approach application does not imply that the profit is made on the degradation of the society . And it is obvious that if the sex-workers had education , a place to work and a decent salary they would never have found themselves on the panel and could be their labor would have brought a bigger income for the budget . Canada needs to change the economic approach to the human approach and study everything concerning the prostitution for new ."	0

Last night he was questioned by an inquisitor of the War Crimes Court in Belgrade . Karadžić has been accused by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Bosnian War from 1992 to 1995 . The Srebrenica massacre , in which about 8,000 Muslims were killed , is among the most serious of his alleged crimes . The massacre was categorised as genocide by both the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia . Internationally , the arrest was unanimously welcomed . Along with former military chief Ratko Mladić , Karadžić has been one of the most sought-after war criminals of the Balkan conflict . Described by the BBC's Kate Adie as a "" smart , rather vain man "" , his capture found him with a long white beard working in a clinic and practicing alternative medicine under the name Dragan Dabic ."	8
1412	"When it comes to their planning process , many financial institutions choose to stay the course and execute , not sure that an updated planning effort would be worth it . But that 's not the sentiment that resonates among banking industry outperformers , who regard their planning process as essential to achieving business alignment and focused execution . They aim to formulate a plan that illustrates the value proposition that will attract and retain customers , and the strengths that will enable the business to deliver this value to customers , while simultaneously earning an attractive return-on-equity . As a result , and perhaps not surprisingly , these companies enjoy strong organic growth and higher shareholder returns . That makes sense . Their customers are served distinctively , while internally , managers reach decisions effectively and efficiently . However , the majority of financial services executives say that the frustrations that go along with strategic planning are holding them back . We often hear complaints such as , "" Let 's face it ... we call it a strategic planning process , but it 's actually just a financial forecasting effort , "" or , "" Our consultants delivered a fat book full of urban legend assertions , but we would have been better off with a thin one that really got to the essence of what we should do to gain profitable share . "" Characteristics of a Broken Planning Process Ineffective strategic planning processes have several unfortunate outcomes . They often emphasize tactics and not strategy , and then end in a "" cram-down stage "" that leaves a bad taste among participants . As one business manager commented , "" We spent hundreds of man-hours planning a business , and then we were told all of us had 10 % revenue growth and 3 % cost growth bogeys . "" Another common outcome is financial forecasts that are infeasible to fund . When this occurs , business managers will inevitably be asked to reformulate their plans to meet Wall Street's short-term expectations . Problems also occur when too many viewpoints are accommodated under a collegial , "" group-think "" approach . Resulting plans often end up describing broad concepts for how the business will differentiate itself . These compromises accommodate the group , but do not provide the context for making tough allocation of resources decisions – which is , after all , the essence of strategy . Eliminating Low Value , Costly Distractions Plans that claim to offer "" everything for everyone "" are more expensive and run a high risk of becoming "" great intentions , never realized . "" These problems result in a set of tactical initiatives to cut costs and a half-hearted commitment to the revenue plan , exacerbated by a lack of differentiation in the market . Everyone ends up being disappointed – most silently , some vocally . To avoid low value , costly distractions , executives should take a more constructive approach to strategic planning . Spend time developing and gaining consensus on a more focused value proposition and determine the implications for prioritizing initiatives , while deprioritizing others . Steps for Effective Planning Devising a strategic plan that ultimately aligns a company's business segments , and propels organic growth and shareholder returns requires an internal analysis of the institution and its objectives in the marketplace . Call it a four-part process , in which executives will first , clearly identify and communicate financial goals to their company and ask senior management to answer fundamental questions such as , "" why would prospects choose to bank with us ? "" Then , executives must review their new value-driven plan and commit to making it the basis for the company's future strategy and eliminate discretionary investments and activities that are not central to the strategy . 1 . Spell It Out : At the outset , executive management should be clear in communicating the goals for the corporation , including any "" must have "" financial objectives . Ideally , this step should also include guidance for each line of business . For example , one unit may be challenged to grow faster than the market while maintaining its profitability ; another may be told to fix its low margins before emphasizing growth . 2 . The Litmus Test : As each unit prepares its strategy , management should make sure that each strategy includes consideration of the fundamental issues that , once resolved , will guide decisions on allocation of resources and will focus execution . One way to help business heads and planners understand how to approach planning is to adopt an entrepreneur's mindset . Produce a strategy that would stand up to the scrutiny of an independent venture capital or private equity firm that you wish to attract an investment from by addressing the following four areas : W hat the business will achieve : Although this is a derivative of the strategy and should be completed last , it 's is often the first topic to be discussed with executive management in the strategy review . It 's mostly composed of financial goals , but the best plans will also highlight the competencies that are important to the business' competitiveness . Where the business will compete : Examine the criteria to be used to decide where in the competitive landscape to focus . Typically , this is based on analysis of growth and ROE potential . These criteria should guide specific recommendations for the types of customers to target , the products and channels to emphasize , and the geographies on which to focus . How the business will win : One of the most critically important steps in strategic planning is determining how the business will be successful . If it 's not compelling , the value of planning will be substantially compromised . The strategy must be as straightforward and specific as possible in describing the value proposition that will motivate customers to do business with your bank versus competitors . Once defined , a companion section should describe how value will be provided at a cost that will enable the business to generate attractive economics . Finally , if acquisitions are envisioned , this section should explain their contribution to the strategy and how the acquisition premium will be earned back . · How the business will be managed : It is important to highlight those aspects of the organization design , management processes , performance measures , culture , and incentives that will be aligned with the strategy . Someone reading this section should be able to understand how the recommended approach will facilitate achievement of the goals . It is critically important to align the metrics and incentive plan . Without such alignment , people will continue to do what makes their wallets bulge , and you might as well delete the strategy before you even print it out . 3 . Recap : At this point , reviews should be held with senior management . Such reviews should begin with a discussion of the proposed value proposition : Will customers be motivated ? Business managers should be asked , "" Okay , let 's pretend I am a prospect in your target market . Tell me in a straightforward manner ... why should I do business with you instead of your competitors ? "" If the answer to this question is not compelling , the business needs to rethink its value proposition . The worst case occurs when the business seeks to be distinctive in too many dimensions , e.g. , convenience , service quality , price , and segmentation . This is the state of affairs in most banks that are losing share . More subtle , but also problematic , is deciding that , for example , "" We will win with superior service "" without defining precisely what aspects of service will be distinctive . This leads to a false sense of consensus that later breaks down as management grapples with a myriad of investment proposals and activities to be approved which all appear consistent with a strategy that is too broad . What is really needed is more precise resolution of whether the service strategy will focus on having fewer errors , showing customers respect , offering superior hours for convenience , being hassle-free and easy to do business with , offering more personalized banking , etc. Once the answer to the "" why should I do business with you "" question is concise and convincing , then the business team should be asked , "" Now tell me how you are going to deliver this extra value to customers and still achieve an attractive return on equity . That is , what will be the behind-the-scenes competencies that will underpin success ? "" Present the plan as if to a venture capitalist who is being asked to invest It is essential to achieve clarity and buy-in on the answers to the two fundamental questions noted above during a friendly but rigorous scrutiny of the strategy . If full buy-in is achieved , execution alignment can be accomplished . Even 75 % buy-in will not be enough , as the 25 % outliers will hinder efficient decision-making , delay execution , add complexity , and cause the organization to be more confused than efficient . Buy-in failure essentially guarantees ineffective execution . So , the quality of the answers to these questions is the critical determinant of whether ( i ) the effort is strategic , ( ii ) top management will fund , and ( iii ) the initiatives will lead to focused action . 4 . Talk the talk and walk the walk : Finally , and ideally after they are approved by top management , strategic plans should become the basis for next year's financial plan . Only after the strategic plan has been challenged , refined , and accepted should budget detail for its first year be constructed . Creating the budget at this point is more efficient , as it is now less likely to need revision , and adds value by further validating – or challenging – the near-term aspects of the strategic plan . It is also vital that periodic reviews include a discussion of strategic milestones that are not financial in nature , i.e. , the key initiatives and leading indicators that will drive the financials . More quality thinking ... less make-work Ensuring that these four steps are in place will go a long way toward making a planning process successful . At best-practice institutions , the whole planning process is frequently so well honed that it can start a mere four to five months before the fiscal year-end . Such institutions often start in mid-August , with the initial top-down corporate plan developed in September and the individual business planning cycle running from mid-September to November . Budgets come to their conclusion in early to mid-December . Boards are presented with and asked to approve strategic and financial plans in mid - to late December , and receive the final budget in January . Does this "" best practice "" approach require more effort ? Certainly it mandates disciplined thinking about your customer needs , your value proposition relative to that of the competition and how you will deliver that value at an attractive return . However , if there is less make-work , the odds of a failed process are dramatically reduced ."	7
1156	"Child abuse is an immense problem that does require immediate help provided to the child from the side of specialists . Once a teacher gets an allegation of abuse from a child , he must not require a written statement from the child or must not make the child repeat the allegation in front of other teachers or adult people . The teacher must not wait until the end of the school day , but report immediately by the means of telephone and support it with a written report within the next 36 hours . The teacher takes individual responsibility for the report , so it can not be done anonymously . Both the telephone and the written report are subjects of certain legal procedures . The telephone report should include detailed information about the person making the report and detailed information about the child , suspected of being a victim of abuse : location , special needs , injury , ect . Afterwards all the details must be repeated by the contact person and approved by the reporting teacher . By no means a teacher should contact the child's parents and a teacher should not make an investigation . The next step after the telephone report is the written report . A fax report is an interchangeable form of a written report , required by the "" Department of Children and Family Services "" . The written reports are made through the forms : SS 8572 or SS 8572 ( 2 ) , reporting the fact of child abuse and by the form DOJ 900 , which is a medical report . Copies should be made and saved by the reporter for further organizational process . Generally all the forms if needed are provided by the child protective agency . All the information in the forms must be full and as objective as possible . They require detailed information about the life of the child , his needs and other information . A personal opinion of the reporter has no legal value . The information of both written and telephone report is confidential . This confidentiality in case of its violation may result in 6 month of jail , for the person violating it . The teacher may feel free to contact the child protective agency for any questions that may occur throughout the process of reporting the abuse or neglect . The identifying information provided by the reporting teacher should be clear . The teacher is completely responsible for any information that he conceals , including the name of the possible perpetrator from the contact person . The response and the actions of the child protective agency following the reports may have a wide range . The teacher has to be ready in case the parent requests details about the reasons the child abuse report was made . Only a small amount of people have access to the report details – and they always are designated reporters such as CARE Program SCAN Team members . The main role of the teacher is to make the report legally right , according to the local abuse-reporting plan . Any illegal action , incorrect information that does not coincide with the reality and is subjective attitude is a law violation and the teacher takes responsibility for false evidence ."	0
1127	"Apichatpong Weerasethakul : The Serenity of Madness , reviewed by Adeline Chia / ArtReview Apichatpong Weerasethakul : The Serenity of Madness Adeline Chia reviews the Thai artist's first retrospective in his homeland , in Chiang Mai's brand new museum Maiiam Museum of Contemporary Art , Chiang Mai , 4 July – 10 September 2016 If anyone can make you lose your mind in a relaxing way , it 's Apichatpong Weerasethakul . Memories , ghosts , reincarnation , Thai history and a reality-loosening , faculty-scrambling sense of joy and wonderment come together so sweetly in this midcareer survey of the critically acclaimed filmmaker's short films and video installations that the experience is , as the title suggests , a kind of safe letting go . Cynics would look at the content and say that it 's more of the same , but when the same 's so good , can you bring yourself to complain ? The Serenity of Madness brings together the ' gallery work ' of the Thai auteur best known for the Palme d ' Or-winning Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives ( 2010 ) . Over the years , he 's built up a reputation on both the film-festival and biennial circuits , but his output for the latter remains scattered and unconsolidated , and often portrayed as the interesting but poorer cousin of his movie career . Hopefully , this exhibition will provide some corrective reimagining of the relation-ship between the two halves of his life . Another artist-filmmaker , Steve McQueen , once said his work was ' all one thing , as if film was the novel and visual art is poetry ' ; Weerasethakul's pieces have a similar kinship . The shorter ones are koans . Made before , during and after his films , his videos and installations may be spinoffs , sketches or one-off commissions , but most of them stand alone quite proudly . Curator Gridthiya Gaweewong designed the exhibition to show the breadth of Weerasethakul's practice , and so there is a necessary amount of excerpting and chronological jumps , which creates an easygoing environment consistent with the genial , free-flowing genealogy of his methods . Primitive ( 2009 ) , originally a seven-video installation at Haus der Kunst , Munich , receives three video extracts here , spread out across the exhibition grounds as recurrent , free-associative echoes . A ' lite ' version of the infrared dogs in Taipei's National Palace Museum's 2007 installation The Palace ( Pipittapan Tee Taipei ) appears too . The projections have been released from their original glass cases and left to pace the walls like the ghostly guards of another video , Sakda ( Rousseau ) ( 2012 ) , in the same room . There are a couple of patchy spots . Some of Weerasethakul's photography is up on the walls , but the still images , after you have savoured the richness of his moving ones , are weak tea . They are either formal experiments with prettified technical effects , such as the digitally painted explosion in Mr Electrico ( For Ray Bradbury ) ( 2014 ) , or thin collectable stand-ins for larger projects , such as the stills for those in the sprawling multidisciplinary For Tomorrow For Tonight ( 2011 ) , first shown in the Irish Museum of Modern Art , Dublin . Thankfully , the meat of the exhibition is in the short films and video installations . Many of them incubate tropes that would be seeded into feature-length work . Seen in isolation , they have the punch of the single image or idea . For example , the six-minute , haiku-esque Sakda ( Rousseau ) could well have been a deleted scene from the doodly and meandering hourlong feature Mekong Hotel ( 2012 ) . Standing alone , the short film has a sharper , more decisive outline . This has something to do with the brief : the short was commissioned for the centennial celebrations of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's birth , and Weerasethakul , with a mix of practicality and wryness , has made his regular gay Thai actor a reincarnation of the French philosopher . "" I used to be a man called Rousseau , "" Sakda Kaewbuadee says while a guitar strums tenderly in the background , "" but today my name is Sakda . "" He goes on to talk about his boyfriend Laurent , and about his body not belonging to anyone , not even him . Abrupt cut to a riverside veranda , from which a radio broadcasts the same recorded message to the dusky pink of the Mekong River . "" Will I remember the freedom ? "" the fuzzy voice asks . The melancholy resignation of this piece , combined with its keen attentiveness to beauty , seems to float , in the gentlest of ways , a challenge to Rousseau : could man be everywhere in chains and free ? It is notable that this is Weerasethakul's first major retrospective in his homeland . His long tussle with the authorities has culminated in his refusal to submit his latest film , Cemetery of Splendour ( 2015 ) to the censor board , and the film has had no domestic release as a result . Why did he put this show on ? Do censors close one eye to art exhibitions ? Who knows ? Judging by Serenity ... , politics runs through Weerasethakul's nervous system , either as a kind of muscle memory or surfacing like hives . The exhibition is not so much a critique of Thai politics as a description of a state of mind under the regime , a negative-capability zone between submission and rebellion , between Sakda and Rousseau . For example , in Ashes ( 2012 ) , gently diaristic images of daily life – friends walking a dog , Weerasethakul calling his lover for dinner – are interrupted by a sequence showing protesters outside Thailand's political prisons . The film then circles back to the everyday , with a dislocating sequence showing the funeral pyre of a monk in a temple . Two videoworks in the exhibition , though , suggest a growing sense of urgency and subversion . One of Weerasethakul's central preoccupations is light in all its forms : the sun , fire , lightning , fluorescent tubes – not to mention that witness , mediator and reproducer of all the photo phenomena , the bright eye of the film projector . Light is often associated with joy and life , but increasingly , Weerasethakul is paying attention to its other face : that of terror and death . This tension can be traced back to Phantoms of Nabua ( 2009 ) . The 11-minute video was part of the larger Primitive project , for which he collaborated with teenagers in Nabua , a village in the north of Thailand where the massacre of a generation of farmers accused of being communists was buried and forgotten . Weerasethakul took a mildly interventionist approach with the sons of these dead farmers : making them roleplay their elders , write songs and tell stories . From these activities , he made short films and installations . Phantoms is the strongest of the lot . It has a pyromaniac's sense of liberation . In the video , the boys kick a burning ball around a dark field . At the back of the field is a white screen , showing a film about a simulated lightning strike . After several passes , the ball hits the screen . For a while we are uncertain if the screen is showing flames , or actually on fire , until the cloth burns away to nothing , and reveals a sputtering , spitting ball of light . It is the projector still going strong . This is the kind of totalitarian culminating shot he has deployed before , in Syndromes and a Century ( 2006 ) . There , the camera lingered on a ventilator slowly inhaling smoke into its cavernous mouth ; but here , calm suction turns to feverish repulsion , a black hole into a death star . The tension between life - and death-giving forces of light reappears in another retina-burn of an installation , called Fireworks ( Archive ) ( 2014 ) . In flares of light accompanied by sharp cracks of gunfire , the camera strobes images of a temple's stone statues : a monkey with a gun , a pack of dogs on scooters and human skeletons embracing on a bench . Through the pyrotechnics , a pair of spectral lovers stroll . One of them is regular actress Jenjira Pongpas on crutches , dragging her bad leg , once memorably described by Thai critic Kong Rithdee as ' the saddest leg in all cinema ' . On one level , you could read this as a film about political persecution and resistance . There is the militarised bestiary , the explosive soundtrack and the location : the video was filmed in a temple in Nong Khai , built by a Thai mystic-cum-sculptor who , accused of being a communist during the Cold War , fled to Laos . But as with all of Weerasethakul's works , the political reading is just one of its many lives . The man himself calls Fireworks a ' hallucinatory memory machine ' . If so , its technology is so alien and advanced that I can only describe it in the most ' primitive ' of vocabularies : visitations by ghosts and gods . For I found it more like a powerful haunting , a jolt of lucid sympathy I imagine a medium would get at a scene of a violent event . And for a long time after leaving the room , I was still blinking the blaze out of my eyes . This article was first published in the October 2016 issue of ArtReview ."	5
647	For many years I went to an Italian deli all the way from south London into Soho just so that I could have that interaction with this Italian deli and buy my food from there . Crazy thing to do , because it takes you an hour to get there , to do this bit of weekend shopping . So it is my need and my love of that kind of life that I really would like to lead , but you ca n't , you ca n't , you know , I hate supermarkets and I hate impersonal things , so I 'm a very people type of person . And that , I ca n't find that in London . I mean okay , Paris is a big city , Milan is a big city , but I can find that there .	1

1595	- Tom Presland to send Leonard Cheshire policy re . sex to Tuppy - Discuss ways of targeting ' tops ' of organisations ( professional bodies , trusts / organisations ) to give permission for sex to be included on the disability agenda . Lorna and Tuppy to draft document for this . - Lorna has not contacted RNIB as yet . She will contact Wayne to find out who has replaced Christine Thomas and find out any progress that has been made in adding sex to the daily living section of the RNIB website . - Katie was unable to approach Peter White at the College of Occupational Therapists Conference in June . She will try and contact him via the BBC . - Victoria has circulated background information to SHADA members regarding policies around mental capacity / consent from her work in NYC . If anyone would like a copy , please contact Katie or Victoria ( tormc3@yahoo.com ) . Victoria will ask for permission for a summary of this policy to be posted on the Outsiders website . - Helena will arrange to meet John Blandford , who presented at this meeting for further discussion - Tuppy sent the number of a stripper – Solitaire - to Helena , following which Kate organised an event for 2 strippers to entertain residents ( who had chosen to attend ) at Chaseley Trust . The event went very well and Helena recommended Solitaire for anyone considering booking a stripper for their disabled clients . Although Chaseley Trust solicitors had suggested a music and dance license may have been required for this event , John Blandford disagreed and said a license was not necessary for such a one-off event . - Tuppy does not have a copy of Davina McColl's sex education in schools program – Lorna will try and get hold of a copy and circulate it . Background : Treloar College ( www.treloar.org.uk ) is a residential specialist college for physically and / or learning disabled young people , aged between 17 and 22 years old . Given this age range , the focus of the college is transition to adulthood . There are 175 students at the college , mostly residential . The College is funded by the Learning and Skills Council . Graham reported that the students enrolling at the College are presenting with increasingly complex needs . For example around 20 % have life-limiting conditions , and there are an increasing number of technologically-dependent students . Around 80 % are wheelchair users . In addition to physical disabilities , the young people at Treloar can also present with additional sensory impairments , epilepsy and overt mental health issues . Graham reported difficulties in accessing CAMHS services for students who had physical disabilities in addition to their mental health needs . There are 370 staff at the College including teams of therapists ( occupational therapists , physiotherapists and speech and language therapists ) as well as a health centre and links with local hospices . Many of the students at Treloar have been in mainstream education previously , and make a positive choice to come to Treloar as the College is able to take care of their disability needs , freeing them to focus on other things . Graham started working at Treloar in 1995 , with a background as a mental health social worker . At that time , there were two issues at the College – sexuality was not discussed , and there was a policy in place prohibiting intimate sexual contact within the grounds as well as a policy that students had to dress formally . As principal of the College at that time , Graham was approached by both students ( regarding lack of privacy ) and staff ( who felt exposed and unsure of their boundaries regarding student needs to express their sexuality ) . However as sexual expression and exploration were recognised as a key part of adolescence , Graham gathered a group of staff , students and parents , giving them the task of coming up with policies and procedures for students to express their sexuality . The policy was to be inclusive , covering gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender . The policy took a year to develop – it was called the SAFE policy . A barrister was then consulted regarding the issue of informed consent . The guidelines regarding implementation of the policy were very specific . Staff were able to opt out , but had to be neutral in doing so . Posters are placed around the College to promote the SAFE policy and student rights regarding sexual expression , and there is a supportive team in place . The SAFE policy is also in the student handbook and all parents / guardians are made aware of its existence when sending a child to the College . In a nutshell , if students are over 16 and are able to consent , they can engage in whatever they want to , as long as it is legal . Choices and risks are discussed with students , and teaching given on safe sex , but the final choice is left up to individual students . Students are encouraged to organise their own activities to develop their independence , including planning trips out of College . For example , one student organised his own visit to a massage parlour in Oxford . Graham has had no negative attitudes towards the SAFE policy recently , though some staff left when the policy was first introduced 8 years ago . Regarding issues of power between service users and staff , College staff can facilitate , support and enable but staff will not be involved in actually stimulating someone . Staff can position a person and support someone to get pornographic material or sex aids ( if they are over 18 ) , but have to make it clear to the individual that this material is strictly not to be seen by anyone under 18 years old . Staff also have to be very clear about boundaries . As yet , the College have not had any sex workers on site , due to legal concerns and concerns about repercussions . Graham sees having the chance to experiment with sex as part of the transition to adulthood . However the situation for young people with disabilities is different to those without disabilities . The relationship between parent and child is often skewed , with no secrecy allowed for the young person . Paradoxically , many young people may have had to make big decisions about their life such as operations , at a young age though are excluded from some roles such as having a Saturday job . At some point , parents have to address their child's emerging sexuality though many do not know how to approach this , and are grateful to the College for addressing the subject . In order to protect students , there are also guidelines for recognising when someone is being manipulated or harassed by other students . In addition , there are legislative safeguards including Protection of Children and Protection of Vulnerable Adults . In general , the SAFE policy has been a success and is a positive example of what can be done to enable sexual expression for young people with disabilities . - Contrary to Graham's positive comments from parents , others have experienced complaints from family members regarding enabling sex for older adults . Many disabled people had not been offered a chance for sexual expression before and relatives are reluctant to change the status quo . - Tuppy said most people join Outsiders when they are 30 years plus . This is perhaps because teenagers have other mainstream avenues to meet friends / partners . However Simone reported that Stars in the Sky have many young members who have not been successful in mainstream venues . - Consensus of opinion that permission to discuss sex needs to come from the ' top ' for this topic to be successfully embraced and addressed by staff , such as Graham as principal of Treloar College . For example , healthcare professionals need permission to discuss sex-related issues with clients , as this often has not been covered on their training . These professionals need the support of their governing body such as the Health Professions Council , etc. - Criminal law is much less of a threat to health care professionals than their governing body ... - No particular health professional who is responsible for addressing sex – usually relies on one person who is interested in this area to push the agenda , but no lasting effect . - Problem is that many health professionals do n't want to address sex ... Helena got a poor reception when she mentioned sex as part of recreation at the recent European Platform of Rehabilitation Services . - Possibly difficult for a non-disabled person to run training on sex and disability , as all disabled people have individual needs , and different areas of disability need different approaches . You ca n't necessarily clump together people with one disability and list the sexual problems that they all share , because they may not share the same problems . - George has set up an interest group re . sex and learning disabilities over the internet and has got a good response . - Can use sex workers to enable couples to have sex . Disabled people used to having someone else around so not as intrusive as it might seem . - Leonard Cheshire have policies regarding sex but they do n't seem to be used in practice . - We need a set of core values so people can use these to base their work around . ACTION Presentation : Ariana Chevalier – ' Sex Worker of the Year ' Ariana gave a very interesting presentation covering : Health benefits of a sexual outlet Ariana also spoke about her work generally including some of the more specialist areas she have developed , including Sensual Awakening / Tantra sessions , Holistic Sex Coaching ( sexual confidence and skill building ) and Practice Partner ( Relationship Development Skills ) . Please see handouts for further information . Discussion arising from presentation : - How to find a male sex worker : more difficult to find a straight male sex worker as most work with men . Regular search engines are not reliable – best to use TLC website – www.tlc-trust.org.uk The contents of this informative talk are covered in a paper , prepared by John that will accompany these minutes . However , there was one point that came up several times that is worth highlighting : It is NOT and NEVER HAS BEEN an offence ( under English law ) to call a sex worker either for yourself OR ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE ELSE as long as the person consents . Discussion point from presentation : - Even though it is legal to call a sex worker , the popular belief is that it is illegal and this will be difficult to challenge . Need to find a way around this . - Tuppy suggested that we compile a short hand-out which John Blandford endorses , to give out to people who do n't believe the above . Any Other Business - We need to prepare a mission statement for SHADA , to send with a press release to professional bodies , etc. - The highly commended book - ' Sex at the Margins – Migration , Labour Markets and the Rescue Industry ' by Laura Maria Agustin ( Zed Books 1988 ) demonstrates how many migrants are happy working in the sex industry and the real problem are the ' do-gooders ' who try to rescue them . - Ideas for new books : Ø One with different chapters for each talk at SHADA . It could cover visual impairment , sex workers , the law , Treloar College as an example of good practice , and Pru's experience as a sex worker with a learning disabled client . Ø A guide for sex workers who see disabled clients – could cover general information that would be useful , as long as it is clear that disabled people have very individual needs ( like all of us ) . - Training and supervision for sex workers : Ariana suggested the following could be implemented in the sex industry , as part of her vision for the future ~ Ø First aid as part of training for sex workers Ø Code of Conduct for Sex Workers including health and safety , boundaries Ø Network of sex workers to support each other and offer supervision - Idea of topic for Autumn meeting is ' Sex and Spina Bifida ' Venue , Time , Focus and Date of Next Meeting Ø Developing a mission statement for SHADA Ø Discussion of how to persuade people at ' the top ' to take sex seriously and allow us to do as we wish . This is the Home Secretary downwards and includes funders and professional bodies .	8
1584	"PDAs Bring Hand-Held Solutions to Healthcare Author Email Personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) have found a niche in the healthcare market since their inception several years ago , and today the devices give doctors and nurses a critical wireless connection to patient records and Web-based databases to aid diagnosis and treatment . PDAs are no longer just for keeping track of appointments , as hospitals and healthcare systems now integrate PDA connectivity into their computer networks to allow access to patient records . This has allowed clinicians to keep up to the minute on patient conditions and review information from tests and patient vital signs even if they are not in the hospital . Connecting PDAs to hospital systems When hospitals issue PDAs to their staffs , the key is making the information they can access meaningful with connectivity to the hospital computer networks . SOTI Inc. is one company that provides software to connect PDA devices to hospital systems and patient electronic medical records ( EMRs ) . It also allows large networks of these mobile devices to be managed remotely by hospital IT staff . Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City , MO , has issued more than 400 HP iPAQ Pocket PCs to its doctors , residents and nurse practitioners in every department . Via SOTI , clinicians can gain encrypted access to an abbreviated version of patients' EMRs to review and enter information and type in notes , look at summaries of patients' vital signs , radiology notes , lab results , and retrieve and copy previously entered patient notes to save time . "" The main reason we give the iPAQs to them is because all of our inpatient notes are now done electronically – we do n't do any writing-out of notes anymore , "" said Jeyson Peters , Children's Mercy's systems analyst who maintains the network of iPAQs using SOTI . He said the devices are also installed with Lexicon , a drug reference and interaction checking software with built-in drug calculators , and M.D. On Tap , a medical search engine that will seek out information helpful for diagnosis and treatment options . SOTI allows regular automatic software updates when the devices connect to WiFi . Peters also said the iPAQs have access to the Internet , eMail , a calendar to enter appointments , Pocket Word , Excel and Powerpoint . The devices have a 4-6 day battery life between recharges , unless there is extensive , constant WiFi use , which can drop the battery life to 10-12 hours , he said . The residents do not have offices , so the iPAQ allows them to work wherever and whenever they have time , he said . The iPAQs have been especially handy when doctors visit area outreach clinics and are able to carry their entire office in their pocket and have immediate access to hospital records . The SOTI system allows Peters to troubleshoot problems and to remotely access any iPAQ encountering problems , regardless if the PDA is located in the hospital or 100 miles away . SOTI software makes remote devices work over any network , and allows the creation of customized reports and full integration of third-party reporting tools . The system can also locate and track mobile assets . Security features include authentication , encryption and device lockdown features to disable the cell phone , Bluetooth or camera features on mobile devices to prevent dissemination of patient information . SOTI's software allows for data synchronization between network servers and mobile devices . "" One of the biggest advantages with SOTI is being able to update the software and to create rules for things like when updates occur , "" Peters said . "" If a doctor has a problem , I can remote in and fix the problem . "" Since doctors also way have a computer in their pocket , it is also easier for them to enter their own notes , instead of relying on a transcription service , which is where Peters said the PDA devices have paid for themselves . "" It has definitely saved us money , "" Peters said . "" There are some doctors who would otherwise have us pay for the transcription of hundreds of pages of notes . "" That return on investment is encouraged among residents by allowing them to keep their iPAQ at the end of their four years at the hospital if they use it to enter their own notes . Peters said the ROI was also the key selling point with the hospital's chief financial officer when the idea of purchasing PDAs was first discussed . "" A lot of the doctors like the PDAs because they fit in their coat pocket , "" Peters said . "" We do n't get many complaints . "" Children's Mercy chose iPAQs because the pocket PCs were more robust and can run more software than smaller smartphones , Peters explained . However , he said the limitations on the IPAQs include a very tiny keyboard , which requires many people to use a stylus to tap the letters . "" Our biggest limitation is just accessing the WiFi on pocket devices , "" Peters said . "" They do not seem to be as intelligent as our laptops . "" He said the iPAQs sometimes do n't differentiate between the hospital's nonencrypted public access network and its encrypted clinical network . Opus Mobility is another company that offers several PDA software solutions for plans of care , electronic charting , work orders , test results , evidence-based medicine and decision support , anatomic pathology and microbiology modules and drug references . The software integrates PDAs and smartphones with hospitals' clinical documentation systems so clinicians can get patient data and vital signs reformatted into a distilled version so it fits on the smaller screens . The system is designed to use a stylus to allow the user to scroll and zoom into information . It transmits clinical information to a cellphone or PDA over a hospital's wireless network , or if outside the hospital , over any of the major cell phone networks . It will work on any Windows Mobile phone . If a healthcare facility does not use the Opus clinical suite , the company said it is compatible with the top 10 hospital information systems . It is an HL7-based system . Opus Mobility has been in use in several hospitals for more than a year and as of this spring was being installed in five more facilities . Patient safety in palm of your hand Volumes of clinical information are available anywhere at clinicians' fingertips with the help of the Internet and PDAs or smartphones . Dozens of universities and companies offer clinical reference software for wireless PDA devices , ranging from anatomical images , drug and dosing references and disease diagnosis and treatment references . Web-based healthcare software maker Epocrates Inc. has developed Web-based products to help clinicians reduce medical errors , improve patient care and increase productivity . It integrates references on drugs , diseases and diagnostics , a medical dictionary and a reference for CPT codes . He started using Epocrates shortly after it was introduced 10 years ago . Dr. Rugg uses Epocrates Multicheck at the bedside to check for interactions between numerous prescribed and over the counter drugs a patient may be given . He can add in the medications he recommends to check for potential interactions . The database , which is updated weekly , also gives clinicians access to formularies , dosage calculators , providing dosing based on parameters such as renal insufficiency or weight in pediatric patients . Using Epocrates ID , Dr. Rugg can search symptoms , find out about an infectious process or an organism , and get recommendations for appropriate medications . He said all his residency students are issued PDAs with Epocrates to aid them when confronting diagnosis and drug questions in the ED . Dr. Rugg used Epocrates on a Palm PDA , but now uses a Blackberry . He said the database for the Blackberry is not as full as the Palm , but additions are being made regularly . The company supports PDAs and smartphones that use the Palm , Windows Mobile and Blackberry operating systems ."	0

1503	Rabbits are social animals and should therefore preferably be kept in pairs or groups , ideally reared together from birth . When you get a new rabbit or a pair of rabbits together , it is wise to get one , or ideally both , of the rabbits neutered . If opposite gender rabbits are kept together with no intention of breeding then one or both will need to be neutered from 4 months old . Watch for the male's testicles to descend from 3 months old and separate the rabbits immediately this is seen , keeping them in sight and sound of each other . At Wendover Heights Veterinary Centre , our vets and nurses are experienced with rabbit anaesthesia and surgery , and we will be happy to discuss with you what having your rabbit neutered involves . Reasons for spaying Does : prevention of pregnancy if kept with male prevention of uterine cancer ( some statistics suggest as many as 80 % of entire does may develop uterine cancer over 5 years of age ) to eliminate aggression which may develop at puberty to eliminate false pregnancy to prevent spraying if kept indoors The best age is 5-6 months old . Reasons for castrating Bucks : to prevent pregnancy if kept with a Doe to reduce aggression to prevent spraying if kept indoors The best age is as soon as the testicles descend into the scrotum , around 4 months old . Remember that Bucks may still be fertile for about a month after castration . Anaesthetic considerations : It is generally appreciated that anaesthetics in rabbits and small mammals are higher risk than many other animals , and unfortunately have a higher rate of anaesthetic deaths compared to dogs and cats . Although this risk is still very small , it is enough to warrant a careful cost-benefit analysis for each procedure . The reasons for this increased risk are as follows : Rabbits , as prey animals , are notorious for hiding signs of disease . For example , there may be pre-existing pneumonia with substantial lung disease without the rabbit ever having shown clinical signs . In combination with the rabbit 's particularly narrow airways this can produce breathing difficulties under anaesthesia . With outdoor rabbits , observation may not be as good as it could be , and so early signs of illness may be missed Rabbits are particularly susceptible to stress and the huge surge of adrenaline they produce when stressed can affect the heart . Having said this , rabbit anaesthesia is safer than it has ever been before , with improved knowledge and skill and state-of-the-art anaesthetics . Our vets and nurses are very experienced and confident in anaesthetising small mammals , using the very best in anaesthetic drugs . For many procedures , where possible , we will place a tube into the airway to allow better oxygen supplementation ( compared to using a face mask ) . Very often the procedure recommended will greatly improve the animal's quality of life or even save it , making the procedure more than justified . Please note that there is no need to withhold food or water prior to surgery as rabbits do not easily vomit , and will continue to eat their faecal pellets ( caecotrophs ) through the night anyway . In fact , withholding water would be detrimental to the animal's condition . Sexing rabbits over 12 weeks old is simple as the buck's testicles descend visibly into the scrotum and the penis can be extruded . Sexing of younger rabbits is notoriously difficult and you may need expert help , and preferably several littermates for comparison ! Females have a pointed genital opening closer to the anus , and males , a more rounded orifice further away . Sexual maturity occurs between 3 – 10 months of age with smaller breeds earlier . Breeding should not be attempted except by experienced breeders , as there are lots of possible complications . Please bear in mind before breeding that there are hundreds of rabbits in overflowing rescue centres , including baby rabbits , that need homes . The doe has a period of receptivity to the buck every 5 days from January to June , which may not be obvious . Rabbits are induced ovulators ( meaning they ovulate only after mating ) with a gestation ( pregnancy length ) of 32 days . The buck should be removed towards the end of gestation as the doe can be fertile immediately after giving birth . Sometimes rabbits can have a false pregnancy after an infertile mating or even from being mounted by other does . She will pull fur from her dewlap ( the lump under her neck ) for about 15 days to line an imaginary nest .	4
234	"Agenda Africa's food crisis as a threat to peace and security Briefing by Mr. James Morris , Executive Director of the World Food Programme The meeting was called to order at 3.20 p. m . Adoption of the agenda The agenda was adopted . Africa's food crisis as a threat to peace and security Briefing by Mr. James Morris , Executive Director of the World Food Programme The President ( spoke in Spanish ) : In accordance with the understanding reached in the Council's prior consultations , and in the absence of objection , I shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to Mr. James Morris , Executive Director of the World Food Programme . It is so decided . I invite the Executive Director of the World Food Programme , Mr. James Morris , to take a seat at the Council table . On behalf of the Council , I extend a warm welcome to the Executive Director of the World Food Programme . The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda . The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations . At this meeting , the Security Council will hear a briefing by the Executive Director of the World Food Programme , Mr. James Morris . After the briefing , I will give the floor to those members who wish to address questions to Mr. Morris . I now give the floor to Mr. Morris . Mr. Morris : I thank you very much , Sir , for the distinct privilege , pleasure and honour of being with you today on behalf of the World Food Programme . The purpose of my visit is to talk about Africa , probably with a focus on Southern Africa , but , like all members of the Council , the World Food Programme is very focused on issues in Iraq . We have had a presence in Iraq since 1991 and have been a major implementer of the oil for food programme since late 1995 . I would be pleased to entertain members' questions or comments about the work of the World Food Programme in Iraq after I conclude my opening statement . Our work in Iraq focuses on the potential of having to feed 27 million people in that country at a cost of $ 1 . 3 billion for a period of six months . It is interesting that my assignment today is to talk about Africa , where nearly 200 million people are malnourished and 50 million are severely at risk , especially women and children . People in Iraq have had a generous Government food supply . I can tell the Council today that most people in Iraq have food in their households for the next month . It is ironic that , if people in parts of Africa had a month's worth of food in supply in their homes , they would be overwhelmed . In fact , we have a bit of a double standard in the world . How is it that we routinely accept a level of suffering and hopelessness in Africa that we would never accept in any other part of the world ? My view is that we simply can not let this stand . The causes of Africa's food crises remain much as I described them in December – a lethal combination of recurring droughts ; difficult , failed economic policies ; hostility and conflict ; and the extraordinary , almost unquantifiable impact of HIV / AIDS . The World Food Programme will have a budget in Africa this year of $ 1 . 8 billion . May I tell you that this equals the entire budget of the World Food Programme worldwide in 2002 . Worldwide , global food-aid commitments have dropped precipitously over the last 10 years , from 15 million metric tons in 1999 to less than 10 million last year . The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) would tell us that chronic hunger is actually rising in the developing world outside China and the World Health Organization would tell us that hunger is still the greatest factor in poor health in the world . There is good news . Secretary-General Kofi Annan has placed the issue of African hunger at the top of his agenda . Secondly , France and the United States are working together , within the framework of the G8 , to focus the world on the African food crises . President Chirac will put this issue at the top of the agenda at the G8 meeting in Evian in June and President Bush has announced the creation of a new $ 200 million fund to prevent famine in Africa . In Southern Africa , and to a lesser degree in the Horn of Africa , the impact of AIDS on the political and economic structure grows daily . In January , I returned to the region along with Stephen Lewis , who is the Secretary-General's Special Envoy for HIV / AIDS in Africa . We were struck by the impact the disease was having on both governance and the food sector , and on how the two were intertwined . Much of Africa's political and technical talent is dying or emigrating – a huge depletion of African human resources . More than 7 million African farmers have lost their lives to HIV / AIDS . The peak impact of HIV / AIDS in Africa will not be felt until 2005-2007 . How do you turn around food production in countries that no longer have a viable agricultural extension service ? How do rural children learn to farm when their parents are too sick to teach them ? How do you maintain a basic educational system for children when their teachers are dying faster than new ones can be trained ? In a conversation with the President of Zambia that I will never forget , he said , "" Jim , the most important thing you can do for the people of Zambia is to help us train teachers . Last year we lost 2,000 teachers to death by HIV / AIDS in Zambia , and we were only able to replace half of them "" . The good news is that because of the generosity of many countries and the work of the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , our non-governmental organization partners and other important United Nations agencies , we were able to deliver more than 620,000 tons of food in the region to more than 10 million people , and serious death and starvation were avoided . The issue of genetically modified ( GM ) food has faded and is no longer delaying or disrupting deliveries . Five of the six countries needing aid in Southern Africa are accepting processed and milled GM food . We simply could not have reached the level of food deliveries we have now attained without the constructive problem-solving undertaken as it relates to the GM issue . The WFP remains especially concerned about Zimbabwe , where there have been numerous media reports that food assistance is being politicized . We are confident that this is not the case with our food . In the few instances where we have received credible reports of abuse , we suspended those operations . I have met with President Mugabe six times , and we have offered the services of the United Nations to monitor and verify the food being distributed by the Government there , but we have not yet received a positive response . Inflation , Government monopolization of the food sector and the impact of the land redistribution scheme are likely to mean that the food situation will not stabilize any time soon in Zimbabwe . Our goal is not to politicize but to depoliticize food aid in Zimbabwe . Food should be available to all , based on humanitarian principles , with any other consideration being absolutely inappropriate . That is the case everywhere we work . Hungry people can not afford to be caught in political crossfire . There are those who would have us pull out in crisis situations to punish Governments and to take a stand on political or human rights issues . But WFP believes that emergency aid simply can not be politicized , for good or for ill . When people in power , be they Government or rebels , deny food aid to certain vulnerable groups of the population , we will speak out . While we see our role as neutral and much like that of the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies , our member States have also asked us to be advocates for the hungry . That has put us on a tightrope and in a perpetual balancing act . When Governments take economic actions , such as banning private trade or monopolizing food imports , which undermine the food sector and exacerbate hunger , our member States expect us to speak out , and we will . With respect to the situation in Ethiopia , Eritrea and the Sudan – the Horn of Africa – the numbers of people at risk are comparable to those in Southern Africa . In Southern Africa , a little more than 15 million people are at risk , with half of them in Zimbabwe . More than 11 million people are absolutely at risk of hunger in Ethiopia , with another 3 million on the edge : 20 to 25 per cent of the population . In Eritrea , the situation is much more difficult . It is a smaller country with a smaller population , but with 2.2 of the 3.3 million people absolutely at risk . The situation is further complicated by the conflict , with a good many members of the military yet to be resituated to their home towns . Clearly , drought is the major culprit in the Horn of Africa . We have had good response to our needs for Ethiopia but a mediocre response to our work in Eritrea . The interesting thing about Ethiopia is that of all the countries in the world it has the highest per capita emergency support and the lowest per capita development support . I had the good fortune to be there recently , and I visited communities where a few hundred dollars' worth of food properly used in food-for-work programmes helped communities plan for their future , think about soil and soil erosion and think about the impoundment of water . They planned and prepared , and they will get through this crisis . In the experience , they developed a cadre of community leadership that will serve those communities superbly for a long period of time . Meanwhile , a few miles away , that kind of preparation – investments in prevention and development – was not made , and they are in a catastrophe . There are probably 10,000 communities in Ethiopia that need this kind of help . We are working in 800 right now . Food security has also deteriorated in the western Sahel – Mauritania , Cape Verde , the Gambia , Senegal and Mali – with approximately a million people at risk . We are grateful to many member countries for the investments that they have made in our early warning food response systems . We were not prepared for the problem in Ethiopia of 15 years ago . With the new early response systems , assessment systems and surveillance systems , we are now much better prepared to respond . The issues in Angola , also in Southern Africa , are a bit different , coming out of 30 to 40 years of conflict and armed violence . The good news is that there is peace on the ground . Food is critical to the recovery of the Angolan economy and to maintaining the peace . It was our initial intent to feed about a million people in Angola . Today , we are feeding 1.8 million people . By June , the number will be 2.2 million people . Angola is a wealthy country that needs , over time , to develop a substantial agricultural system . With respect to the issue of refugees and internally displaced people , the World Food Programme cooperates with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees . It is our responsibility to provide the food . Today , in Africa , we are feeding 1.8 million refugees and 5.7 million internally displaced people . It is hugely expensive . The turmoil that this can cause if it is not done properly will have enormous effects on the countries where we work . This is a particularly difficult issue in western coastal Africa . Members have all followed the issues in Côte d ' Ivoire and Liberia , where there are between 4 million and 5 million refugees – people moving about . The conflict is producing enormous chaos in the region . There are things that we need to do and things that we can do . The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) and WFP have warned that the fate of more than 1.2 million refugees in Africa is uncertain due to the lack of funding for much needed food aid . There are places where we have had to cut rations in half or by 25 per cent . Major interruptions in the food pipeline are feared in Tanzania , Uganda , Kenya , Liberia , Sierra Leone , Algeria and the Sudan : the major nations in Africa that host refugees . A few weeks ago here at the United Nations , we had a very positive session with the Group of Eight , which the Secretary-General kicked off , in which we talked about what the world needs to do to get the issues in Africa on a firmer foundation . We talked about the fact that Africans themselves will ultimately have to provide the leadership . They will be responsible for their own domestic policies . Global trade issues will have to be resolved in such a way that they do not become such a huge disincentive for agricultural production and export in places in Africa . The specific points that we left with the group on that occasion are as follows . First , we need a far stronger donor commitment to emergency food aid based on better targeting and more sophisticated early-warning systems . The World Food Programme is funded entirely with voluntary contributions from countries . We receive no core funding from the United Nations . We are the largest humanitarian agency in the world , and our annual budget is larger than the United Nations budget for its New York City operation . We receive 90 per cent of our support from nine countries plus the European Community . There are two dozen more countries that now have the capability to help us , and there are many countries that now have agricultural surpluses that can help us by providing commodity but that do not have the cash to pay for transportation . We have looked for ways to twin countries that have cash with countries that have commodities , and we will see how we can make that work . The leverage is enormous . India has committed a million metric tons of wheat for Afghanistan in part for us to produce high-energy biscuits for a million school children in Afghanistan . We need help from countries that can help with the transportation of the wheat biscuits that are produced in India . We have had good support for the first time ever from the Russian Federation . We are working hard to bring new partners into our programme . Secondly , there is a need for a substantial increase in support for investment in basic agricultural infrastructure , both micro and macro , especially irrigation infrastructure , but also roads and markets . There is a need to make agricultural work easier on women . Women do 80 per cent of the agricultural work in Africa . Women now are 58 per cent of those infected with HIV / AIDS in Africa . They are expected to produce the food and to serve the food . They are expected to give care to so many people who are critically ill in their homes or regions . The world needs to focus on making agricultural production easier for women in Africa . I had a good visit with the Minister of Agriculture of Malawi . He said , "" Jim , the most important thing the world could do for us would be to invest about $ 77 million in an irrigation system that would serve Malawi countrywide . "" Malawi is a country with huge lakes and huge water resources , and a properly constructed irrigation system would address its agricultural issues in a very substantial way . The Secretary-General's call for a green revolution in Africa is one of the most important statements to be made recently . Thirdly , we propose funding of a $ 300 million African food emergency fund that would be an immediate response account that can be used at the very outset of a food crisis . Our emergency response account now has $ 35 million , and our experience suggests that those dollars that are available to invest immediately when there is a crisis on the horizon are those that allow families to keep their farms together and to not sell their coping mechanisms ; a little help at the beginning is worth a lot of help later on in the process . I should also say that in the crisis in Southern Africa , we were very successful in raising cash and commodities to meet the food requirements . We were not very successful in raising the resources for non-food items . Water and sanitation , health , medicine , vaccination and educational issues are every bit as important as food , and somehow the donor community – and as head of WFP I am grateful for this – finds it easier to focus on food and more difficult to focus on other issues . Investments made in farm implements , seed and fertilizer have enormous leverage and help to put people back on their feet . I would encourage members to take a look at those kinds of issues . I mentioned the issue of non-traditional donors . Finally , let me say that the piece of our work that I consider to be maybe the most important is our work with school feeding . There are 300 million hungry children in the world . If we take the Millennium Development Goal of cutting hunger and poverty in half by 2015 seriously – there are 800 million hungry people in the world , nearly 40 per cent of them children ; half of the children do not go to school , and most of those are girls – the single most important investment we can make is in educating children . Educated children become better citizens , better teachers , better parents and better farmers . Whatever one chooses to do with one's life , a person's education directly affects the quality of life and the quality of the community . We know how to feed a child in school for about $ 35 per year . For less than $ 1 per year , we can have extraordinary health interventions led by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) that reduce worms and all sorts of other serious health issues . We fed 16 million children last year ; we need to feed 100 million worldwide and we need to feed another 50 million in Africa . This will be the single best investment , with great leverage , that we can make worldwide in beginning to turn the future of Africa around . I am more grateful than I could ever express to the many countries that have helped us . Last week I had the most remarkable phone call from Canada . Canada committed $ 75 million over the next three years to feed school children . I just had a terrific visit in Switzerland , and Switzerland committed to feed an additional 10,000 school children . We are working hard to engage the private sector with our work . A magnificent Dutch company – TPG – with 150,000 employees committed each one of its employees to feed a school child . If we are thoughtful and resourceful about this and cover a wide range of territory , we will have the opportunity to change the world by feeding school children . I want to underline the critical importance of peacekeeping and diplomacy . War and conflict , in Africa as elsewhere , quickly lead to hunger . People who are hungry and without food have risky behaviours and tend to be more aggressive . War and conflict cut productivity , increase HIV / AIDS , increase populations of refugees and internally displaced persons and dramatically affect children . War changes the focus of the way countries do their business . There is no doubt that in much of Africa hunger and poverty are fuelling conflict and robbing Africans of the bright future they deserve . Their suffering can not be any less to us than the suffering we see elsewhere in the world today . We all must do more to help . The President ( spoke in Spanish ) : I thank the Executive Director of the World Food Programme for his timely and very relevant briefing on a problem that directly affects a very large population . I wish to remind the members of the Council that we have a very long list of subjects to address this afternoon and that we would like to take full advantage of Mr. Morris' presence . Therefore , I request members of the Council to limit questions and comments to strictly necessary ones so that this can be an interactive information meeting , rather than a meeting of statements . Mr. Cunningham ( United States of America ) : My thanks go to Mr. Morris . That was really a superb presentation on this very , very difficult situation . I want to thank him also for his hard work and his organization's hard work in trying to deal with it . Unfortunately , Mr. Morris has outlined the elements of an emergency that force us to deal with the short term and with chronic cases . In his comments he pointed to many of the other elements that make this even more intractable : man-made complications , the politicization of food , the effects of war . We join Mr. Morris in opposing food being used as a weapon , and we are particularly alarmed at the impact of HIV / AIDS , for many of the reasons he described . What I wanted to ask Mr. Morris is , given all this , what has been his most recent message to donors on the crisis ? What have the responses been and what does he assess to be the unmet needs still before us in 2003 ? Mr. Belinga-Eboutou ( Cameroon ) ( spoke in French ) : I would like to say how very pleased we are to have Mr. James Morris , Executive Director of the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , here with us . He has spoken to us about an extremely difficult and relevant issue : the food crisis in Africa , which poses a threat to international peace and security . We have heard to some extent a repetition of what we were told last December regarding the major obstacles to the activities of the WFP : weather conditions , health / sanitation conditions , HIV / AIDS and those that could also be considered as man-made , such as civil disorder , conflict and problems of governance . The question I would like to ask Mr. Morris – in response to your appeal , Mr. President , to get straight to the heart of the matter – is the following . The mandate of the WFP was expanded in 1999 to make the Programme an instrument for development . In fact , WFP was called on to use food assistance , essentially and as a priority , to support economic and social development actions . This was the primary objective . The other objectives relate to so-called emergency situations where there is a need to cope with the immediate needs of refugees and of populations that have fallen victim to humanitarian crises . At present , the emergency functions and objectives seem to be , in fact , highly pivotal to what the WFP is doing . What about the essential function aimed at preventing emergency situations , namely , the use of food assistance to support development actions ? That is my question to the Executive Director ; it refers to WFP's new mandate . We pay tribute to WFP's work , which is so beneficial in emergency situations , including today in Iraq . But that does not prevent us from going back to the crux of the mandate , which is to support development action to prevent emergency situations . Mr. Valdés ( Chile ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : I thank Mr. Morris for his briefing and for the valuable information he has given to the Council today . As previous speakers have mentioned , one can only be powerfully struck by the dimensions of the task , by the severity of the crisis and by the difficulties faced by the World Food Programme ( WFP ) in trying to cope with situations , such as that of Ethiopia and Eritrea , whose urgency Mr. Morris has described . Like Ambassador Cunningham , we wonder how the WFP can today face an emergency affecting 11 million inhabitants without being certain – or at least , we are not certain – about what the actual donations expected from member countries would be ? So my first question would be along the same lines as that raised by Ambassador Cunningham : given a situation such as Ethiopia and Eritrea , what assistance can we expect to receive in order to tackle the magnitude of the crisis ? Secondly , it is clear that when it is said that chronic hunger is growing in the developing world and that hunger in the world is still the main reason for medical emergencies or shortcomings , we are dealing with questions concerning the system . As the representative of Cameroon said , we are facing problems which have to do with development policies and how we address them . The United Nations has a toolbox for this . For decades , we have developed bodies within the United Nations whose function it is to assess the situation in developing countries and to try to provide , particularly through the Economic and Social Council , responses that relate to how the international system can tackle these questions . I would like to ask Mr. Morris if he has any further thoughts about this . Lastly , while entirely aware of the seriousness of the situation in Africa , Mr. Morris explained at the beginning of his speech the tasks that the WFP is undertaking in Iraq . I would like to raise the possibility that we hold another meeting in which Mr. Morris could directly address that issue . Mr. Schumacher ( Germany ) : I thank Mr. Morris very much for a superb presentation and , in particular , for his continuous efforts to brief the Council . I would like to challenge somewhat one of the initial observations that he made in saying that we routinely accept a situation in Africa that we would not otherwise accept in other parts of the world . Are we really routinely accepting such a situation in Africa ? Is it not more something like , may I say , donor fatigue ? I recall correctly that some 10 years ago , there was another serious food crisis in Southern Africa , and the international community responded very efficiently to the call of the WFP and others to cope with that crisis . Now , we are again faced with the same situation . Mr. Morris mentioned that there are two intertwined problems – the scourge of HIV / AIDS and the food crisis – and he and others have vaguely referred to man-made problems . Are there not three intertwined elements that create the deadly brew that makes it almost impossible to cope with these sorts of problems worldwide ? Is not the combination of bad governance , HIV / AIDS and the food crisis the problem that we are facing today ? In that context , my question is the following . Would Mr. Morris agree that , without a sound approach to the establishment of good governance worldwide , any isolated effort to come to grips with HIV / AIDS or the food crisis would remain a piecemeal approach ? I should like to recall that good governance is an important element and an important objective in the Millennium Declaration , which was adopted by our heads of State three years ago . Unfortunately , it does not fall under the heading of "" Millennium Development Goals "" . I very much hope that , when Millennium Development Goals are mentioned in future discussions of this issue as a justified appeal to donors to help us cope with these problems , this third element of good governance also becomes an important objective . Mr. Akram ( Pakistan ) : My delegation would like to join others in expressing our appreciation to Mr. James Morris for his excellent and comprehensive briefing . We are aware of the outstanding work that the World Food Programme has performed in so many crises – including in a neighbouring country , Afghanistan – and we have a very high regard for that organization . In the context of the presentation that we heard this afternoon , the central issue for us to explore is the specific link between the food crisis in Africa and the threat to peace and security . I would be very interested to know whether Mr. Morris has any thoughts about exactly how that relationship exists – whether it exists in a negative way and possibly could be established in a positive way . Mr. Morris has said that our goal is not to politicize food aid but to depoliticize it – in Zimbabwe , for example – and that food should be available to all on the basis of humanitarian principles . I think that is absolutely correct as far as it goes . But , for example , could we use the provision of food assistance – food security – as an incentive for conflict resolution in some of the crises faced in Africa and perhaps elsewhere ? Without politicizing and without depriving people of humanitarian needs , could the provision not only of food aid but also of agricultural assistance , development and technical support be utilized as elements of conflict resolution in Africa and elsewhere ? Secondly , I should like to pose perhaps a more immediate question to Mr. Morris . There is a looming drought and a conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea in the Horn of Africa . How does he think the drought has exacerbated the conflict or has acted to the contrary ? I believe that the food aid received by Ethiopia is perhaps more generous than that received by Eritrea . Are there any reasons for that , and , if so , are they related to the conflict that is under way ? Those are some thoughts that arise from the briefing . Finally , I should like to say that I support the proposal of my colleague Ambassador Valdés that the Security Council receive a similar briefing with regard to the situation in Iraq . The President ( spoke in Spanish ) : I should now like to give Mr. Morris the opportunity to respond to the questions raised . That will allow Council members who wish to pose questions that Mr. Morris has already answered to skip those questions and focus on the responses that he will now give us . I call on Mr. Morris . Mr. Morris : In response to the question from the representative of the United States – and I thank the United States ; it should be said that in 2001 the United States provided more than 60 per cent of the humanitarian assistance for the World Food Programme – the most recent message that we have been trying to convey as it relates to Southern Africa – and , by the way , I agree completely with the representative of Germany's comment about leadership and governance ; they are pivotal and basic to everything – we are overwhelmed with the issue of children . There are 11 million AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan Africa . Zimbabwe has 780,000 orphans ; Malawi and Zambia have somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 orphans . Half the families are headed by someone older than 65 , and it is not uncommon to see a family of five children headed by a little girl 14 years of age who is the same size as my 7-year-old granddaughter . The world's responsibility for these children is enormous in terms of their education , their food and their health . That has also had the most devastating impact on the human resource structure of Governments and institutions . I mentioned the loss of teachers and the depletion and loss of human resources . We are at a point where we are talking about replenishing systems . Essentially , the medical personnel in Southern Africa – the doctors , nurses and pharmacists – are gone . The talent that will be necessary to address these issues is enormous . So we must focus on children and on human resource talent . The HIV / AIDS issue is enormous . More than half a million people died in those six countries last year as a result of HIV / AIDS ; 30 million people are infected in Africa , up 3.5 per cent from last year ; and 34 per cent of the adult population in Zimbabwe is affected by HIV / AIDS , with comparable numbers elsewhere in that part of the world . We have been focusing on the importance of agricultural investment both in a micro sense and in a macro sense , and on the importance of broadening the donor base . Everyone in the world has the primary responsibility to look after his or her own , but we all have some responsibility for those elsewhere who are worse off than we are . We are working very hard at growing our donor base . We will need 3.8 million metric tons of food to do our work in Africa this year ; we will need $ 1 . 8 billion , plus the $ 300 million that we carried over from last year . Eight of our 10 top donors increased their support for the World Food Programme dramatically last year . We need to keep that support growing . We need new donors , and we need help from the private sector . With regard to the question from Cameroon – we have a regional office in Yaoundé ; Cameroon has been a great friend – 10 years ago , 80 per cent of our support was for development . Today , 80 per cent of our support is for emergency relief . I do not know what has happened in the world – I am not a scientist . But , working with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , we are conducting three times as many natural disaster assessments today as we did in 1965 , and twice as many as in 1990 . There has been a change . There are presumably limited resources , and the resources have gone to keep people alive and to reduce human suffering in an emergency context . In emergencies we try as much as possible to ensure that our work has long-term development implications . If we feed a child and encourage that child to go to school , that is development . If we feed a child and enhance the nutritional content of the food with iodine , vitamin A or iron , that is development in a human resource for that country for a long period of time . Some of our most important investments are in food-for-work programmes , whereby we make resources available to feed people if they participate in the rebuilding of a community's infrastructure . In that way the community wins and the family wins . We are very troubled by the fact that today only 20 per cent of our resources are aimed at long-term development – at prevention . That is a huge problem in a place like Ethiopia ; it is a huge problem around the world . Our colleague from Chile asked a question about assistance required for Ethiopia and Eritrea . It has been our plan to feed about 40 per cent of the hungry people in Ethiopia , with the rest being handled by the Government , by non-governmental organizations or bilaterally . We have been raising something in the neighbourhood of $ 205 million there . We are doing a good job – we have raised about 70 per cent of what we need . The issue in Eritrea is much more difficult . We looked to raise more than $ 100 million , but the response has been less than 20 per cent . We work very well with the Government of Ethiopia . With regard to the question raised by the representative of Pakistan about the conflict , my sense is that there are 900,000 soldiers still in the Eritrean army who are being repatriated . Not having that manpower available for agricultural work has been a huge factor in the problem in Eritrea . So I think that the conflict has exacerbated the problem – there is no question about that . Investments in early warning systems , in assessment systems and in surveillance systems for agriculture and health are incredibly important . That gets to the issue of knowing what is likely to happen as soon as possible and being prepared for it . We need to make more investments in doing that better . The technology is there . In analysing what the problems are , historically we have looked only at food issues . But as we do our assessments today and analyse the severity of a problem , we need to look at other issues , too . I agree completely with my colleague from Germany . The issue of governance and leadership is a prime responsibility . Some countries , such as Zimbabwe , are having very difficult problems right now . I am a little more optimistic about the agricultural situation of Malawi and Zambia this year – likewise Mozambique , Lesotho and Swaziland . But the number of people at risk in Zimbabwe has increased , and agricultural production has not increased . Foreign exchange , which would allow for imports , is not available . The private sector does not function there . The donor community does function there . Those are issues that will require enormous leadership if the situation is to be turned around . The question from Pakistan about tying peace and security to food issues was absolutely on target . There is no question in my mind that hungry people behave differently from people who are not hungry . When people are fed and begin to learn they have hope and opportunity in their lives , and lives with hope , opportunity and a future are less likely to be violent . Clearly , we have talked about the issue of refugees and internally displaced persons . We have used food to some degree in conflict resolution in Angola and Sierra Leone . We have offered food as an incentive for people to lay down their weapons , and that has worked pretty well . Beyond that , this is an issue that I think we would be interested in thinking a little more about . We try to stay focused on the humanitarian agenda – the world does not want people to starve . We are especially concerned about the very vulnerable people at risk , including women and children . We try to absent ourselves from all of the other political debates going on . But the representative of Pakistan raised a question worth considering . The President ( spoke in Spanish ) : I thank Mr. Morris for his answers . Mr. Tafrov ( Bulgaria ) ( spoke in French ) : I would like briefly to make two comments and to ask Mr. Morris a question . First , I would like to thank him for his eloquent statement , which I believe will prompt us to reflect further on what actions the Security Council can take . That leads me to my second comment . I would like to thank you in particular , Mr. President , for having included today's meeting on our programme . We now realize that the food situation in Southern Africa and elsewhere in the continent has direct implications for the security of Africa , while security – or , rather , insecurity – has negative implications for the food situation . From that perspective , I believe that it is extremely important for the Council in future to have the knowledge and the capacity necessary to enable it to integrate information and other factors relating to food security into its approach to conflict in Africa . In that regard , I wholeheartedly support the proposal of Ambassador Valdés . I believe that the Council should go even further ; we should not be timid or worry about going beyond our area of competence . My question to Mr. Morris relates to Somalia . He referred to the Horn of Africa . The question of Somalia is on the Council's agenda ; that country is experiencing severe problems . What is the situation regarding food security in that country in the Horn of Africa ? What is the attitude of the donor countries and of donors in general towards Somalia ? Sir Jeremy Greenstock ( United Kingdom ) : I share colleagues' feelings on the importance of this briefing this afternoon and on the terrific role which the World Food Programme ( WFP ) is playing . I would like the Council's praise for that to go to the whole team led by Mr. Morris . It is a huge team effort – one of the most impressive United Nations agency performances of all . I want to home back in on why we are here in the Security Council , listening to this briefing . I want to put the question to Mr. Morris as to what he expects from the Security Council on this . He is saying that , increasingly , WFP is looking at symptoms , not causes , and dealing with the outflow of misery from hunger and other related problems . That means , as he says , that the Programme is looking at more than food issues and increasingly less able – I take this as implicit in what he is saying – to deal with the causes of what is happening . And yet , the causes are , as I gather from his report , as much structural as they are emergency , or due to bad luck or bad climate . Therefore , the United Nations system should be doing something about those structural causes , as well as addressing the misery that comes out of the lack of food and health worldwide . Yes , it is production policy and the arrangements for food production ; yes , it is always never enough donor activity ; yes , we could do with twice as much money and twice as many agencies doing it all ; but it also has to do with the interplay with health problems , particularly HIV / AIDS ; with peace and security on the ground ; with governance ; and with long-term problems and short-term problems . We can go on analysing , and Mr. Morris's oral and written statements do that ; but in the written version , the seven proposals , as well as the six he mentioned orally at the end of his presentation , are not really the responsibility of the Security Council , as such . They are a responsibility of the United Nations family , the donor countries and the Governments on the ground . Yet , Mr. Morris ended by saying how critically important the peacekeeping and diplomatic aspects are . I would like him , perhaps , to give examples of what the Security Council could actually do . There are three things in my mind . One is , of course , conflict resolution . He has pointed to Angola and Sierra Leone as having got better ; Ethiopia / Eritrea as not yet better enough ; and perhaps Côte d ' Ivoire and other places getting worse . Liberia is still a problem and other parts where there are rebellions and wars are still difficult . Secondly , there is the problem of politicization and of governance . Perhaps that , too , is an area where the Security Council can play a role . The third area – one we have not really talked about yet , but one we ought to discuss among ourselves and with our sister organizations – is coordination . If , behind this picture of starvation and misery , there is not just climate , agricultural policy and what is happening on the ground in the agricultural area , but also health and governance and wars and all sorts of other things , should not the interplay between WFP and the Security Council be looking at the coordination of the response ? It is not all our business to get into these areas , but it is our business to do part of it and therefore to work with others in doing all of it . Does he not see a crying need for better coordination within the international and the United Nations systems , much of which may come back to the governance problem ? Mr. Morris mentioned Zimbabwe because it is the one area of Southern Africa which is getting so much worse than the others . He did not say "" unnecessarily "" , but he did not point to a climatic or a coincidental reason . There are things there that , from a human perspective , could go better ; ditto in some other parts of Africa , where the right policies could make this immediately better . To what extent does Mr. Morris believe that the Security Council is making a difference ? Since he only has a few further minutes left with us today , what would he like us specifically to do , until he comes back to talk to us about it again , to make what he sees , from the WFP viewpoint , start improving , rather than continue to go worse ? Ms. Menéndez ( Spain ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : I should like to thank you first of all , Sir , for having organized this interesting meeting , which we deem to be very important . I should also like to thank Mr. Morris for his very interesting briefing , which was concise but very instructive . Mr. Morris gave us information that was very graphic and stark . We see the reality of the problem very clearly . We have two questions . The first is perhaps connected to what Ambassador Greenstock just said , but we wish to ask more specifically : Have we effectively learned the lessons from success stories and from less successful stories of the past , in cases where famine in Africa has been averted and where it has not ? Can the World Food Programme ( WFP ) tell us what the Security Council has done , if anything , in those cases , and what such action might entail in the future ? My second question concerns a concept that Mr. Morris included in his briefing and which he spoke about in passing in his first series of answers to our questions . This is the concept of replenishment . He said that it is currently very difficult to have a capacity-building policy when , for example , parents have died or are ill and can not pass their knowledge in the agricultural sphere on to their children . Has WFP , singly or in cooperation with other agencies , considered the idea of capacity-replenishment , which Mr. Morris , I believe , mentioned earlier ? Mr. Duclos ( France ) ( spoke in French ) : Allow me in turn to convey our gratitude to Mr. Morris for his extremely interesting statement , which I believe both contained highly significant data and figures and communicated a sense of the human experience . We , too , attach the greatest of importance to the question of the food crisis in Africa . As Mr. Morris said , we hope to take advantage of our leadership of the G8 in order to place this issue at the top of its agenda . With respect to Mr. Morris's briefing , I think we were all struck by the magnitude of the crisis and by everything he had to say regarding the interaction of various factors that contribute to and further exacerbate the crisis . Many questions raised by my colleagues here addressed in one form or another the factors contributing to the food crisis . I was struck by the fact that Mr. Morris spoke a great deal of Southern Africa . Southern Africa is perhaps the region that combines the most worrisome factors of the current food situation in Africa . Perhaps that is because it is a region that is not prepared – or is less prepared than others – for large-scale famines and because it is there that the phenomenon of the ravages of AIDS is most glaring , to the extent that perhaps it is the region that most urgently causes us to ask whether the current number of deaths will compromise life in the future and the capacity of those societies to recover for the future . Mr. Morris said that he wanted to concentrate on the humanitarian aspect of the question of food . Therefore we should not ask him too much about the overall strategy or related issues . However , all the questions we have asked naturally touch somewhat on the issue of whether , in these particularly terrible situations , it is necessary to reconsider the international community's overall strategy with respect to those societies ? It is a question that can not be resolved with a few minutes' discussion . However , in that context , I would like to ask a more specific question : on the basis of his experience , does Mr. Morris consider , for example , in Southern Africa – which it seemed to me was the most striking and illustrative case – is all the necessary coordination among the principal actors of the international community actually in place , or is there a need further to unite our energies to deal with this problem from the various angles he himself has mentioned ? I thank Mr. Morris for his attention . I might add that I , too , would be interested in a later briefing by Mr. Morris on Iraq . But I , too , would like him to give us some preliminary information this afternoon , as he proposed earlier . Mr. Boubacar Diallo ( Guinea ) ( spoke in French ) : I would like to join preceding speakers in expressing my delegation's full appreciation to Mr. James Morris for his very rich and instructive briefing on the food crisis in Africa . The last time Mr. Morris spoke to the Council on this issue was on 3 December 2002 . The briefing that he has just given leads to the general impression that the picture is far from rosy . Rather , it is the opposite . The food situation in Africa is becoming increasingly alarming due , as he said , to several causes that vary from one area to another and from one country to another . My question relates to the approach that must be adopted to solve the food crisis in Africa . Is there coordination among the various actors involved in the fight for food security in Africa ? If there is , how does it function ? If there is not , could a viable mechanism be put in place to make this fight more effective ? Mr. Mekdad ( Syrian Arab Republic ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : I would like to join preceding speakers in welcoming Mr. Morris and to express my satisfaction at his very informative briefing . This is one of the most urgent and important of issues and is one to which the Security Council has not devoted enough time . As Ambassador Greenstock mentioned , there are certain limits to the responsibilities of the Security Council . This issue relates to the responsibility of States and , as Ambassador Schumacher of Germany said , to good governance . However , despite those limitations , I think that this issue is very important . It deserves further consideration so that we can clarify the role that the Council could play in resolving this important problem . At the start of his presentation , Mr. Morris mentioned the timely issue of Iraq . We are closely watching the role played by the World Food Programme ( WFP ) within the framework of the oil-for-food programme . I think that it has played a very constructive role . I believe Mr. Morris will agree with me when I say that the situation has changed since the war in Iraq began . We believe that there is a new role for the WFP and humanitarian agencies to play , which would be separate from the role of the oil-for-food programme . That is because the oil-for-food programme was limited to meeting the needs of the Iraqi people during a specific period of time and in a very specific situation . But now , everything has changed . There is a war . That war must be governed by the Geneva Conventions , in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention . We believe that we should not use the Iraqi people's own funds to assist them . We should not take money from their pockets in order to feed them . International funds have to be used . Does the WFP now have the necessary funds to meet the new needs created by the war ? Mr. Gaspar Martins ( Angola ) : I too would like to thank Mr. Morris for coming here . It is not an accident that he is coming to the Security Council . One might ask why . Mr. Morris deals with food ; the Security Council deals with peace and security . Yet , it is important that he has come here . I think the link was established also by what Ambassador Greenstock touched on . I think that at one point in Mr. Morris's presentation , he said that what Africa needs is a green revolution , meaning the opposite of the type of revolutions that we have been seeing , which are , perhaps , red revolutions – we see a lot of blood . We need to change that . Very often , the inadequacy of food supplies , famine and the drastic situations that exist in quite a number of places create conditions conducive to disturbances . Let me raise a question . I too have noted a point that Mr. Morris mentioned : 80 per cent of the resources of the World Food Programme are devoted to emergency situations – in other words , food distribution . Only 20 per cent is devoted to development , meaning food production or addressing other conditions . Something that was mentioned was the question of perhaps investing in more early warning systems , which are needed to prevent some of the food crisis situations . My question is , how is this trend changing ? How is Mr. Morris 's thinking evolving towards a situation where we are looking more at food production and investing more in resources for development to create the conditions for food production , rather than at dealing with emergencies . Granted , there are situations that are emergencies . But in some of these situations – some of them have been mentioned , and one of them is in my country – we will go from crisis situations to post-conflict situations , and the 80 per cent that we are talking about will probably be reduced . In what direction are we moving ? In other words , are we moving in the direction of investing more in development and less elsewhere , in order to do what Mr. Morris mentioned in terms of the green revolution he spoke of ? Mr. Zhang Yishan ( China ) ( spoke in Chinese ) : I listened very attentively to the detailed and informative briefing of Mr. Morris . It has been very helpful in providing us with a better understanding of the food situation in Africa . However , it must be acknowledged that the picture he presented to us , in which 40 million people lack food and face malnutrition , is very grave . Without the strenuous efforts of Mr. Morris and his colleagues , the situation today would be ever more grim and terrifying . We have a saying in China : if you give a fish to a person , he or she can merely eat it as a meal . But if you teach a person to fish , then he or she will benefit from that for life and will live in comfort . Therefore , it is obvious that , in addition to providing aid , a better approach to eliminating poverty and the lack of food is to teach people to fish . I seek clarification about whether or not the WFP works with other international organizations to increase capacity for self-reliance , so that emergency aid can produce better results . The President ( spoke in Spanish ) : I wish to make a comment and to ask a question in my capacity as the representative of Mexico . As Mr. Morris has starkly shown , the food situation in Southern Africa and in other parts of Africa clearly leaves us perplexed in the light of a commitment that the international community still has not managed to fully meet . But food security , which is a moral imperative and a colossal challenge , is also an issue that must be resolved through profound changes in the region . It is clear that human beings have an inalienable right to a healthy and balanced diet . To that end , an immediate challenge is to increase sustainable food production and , on that basis , make the benefits of that production available to the most vulnerable sectors . In Africa , that must be achieved in a particularly adverse environment , where there is soil degradation , desertification and , as Mr. Morris said , recurring natural catastrophes , infections , violent conflicts , civil disturbances – the legacy and effects of which are passed from one generation to the next and are evident in matters as simple as the existence of explosives and landmines in agricultural fields – climate change and , no less important , the HIV / AIDS epidemic and other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis , which also undermine societies' ability to produce . In these circumstances , and given the cited combination of internal and external factors , the international community has a commitment . Mr. Morris pointed out that $ 1 . 8 billion is needed , which seems an extraordinary figure but which is not , if we compare it to today's worldwide military expenditures , which are vastly greater than that figure . Given all that , I would like to simply underscore Ambassador Greenstock's question . From that point of view and taking all the factors into account , what would Mr. Morris say could be done right now by the Security Council , beyond what has already been established as an immediate task , in terms of donors and in terms of the attention that the Security Council should give this item ? What does Mr. Morris think the Security Council should do together with other United Nations bodies to tackle a crisis of the magnitude and dimensions that he has described to us ? I now resume my functions as President of the Council . I call on Mr. Morris . Mr. Morris : May I say that both rounds of questions have raised profound issues , and that it means a lot to the World Food Programme and our colleagues that Council members have all been so thoughtful about the work we are a part of . Clearly , I am unable to give Council members the answers they deserve this afternoon . As we did last time , we will respond in considerable detail in writing to all the questions ; our responses will be available to everyone . The representative of Bulgaria asked a question about Somalia . The situation in Somalia is very troubled . It is a very , very difficult place to work in , and it is a difficult place to assess the magnitude of the difficulty , given the conflict . We have been there for a long time . It is one of the places where we operate the United Nations humanitarian air service . Our programme this year is to feed nearly 3 million people in the country . We have had good success in the past raising nearly 75 per cent of the resources that we need to do our work there . It has been encouraging , in that it is one of the places where we have a very broad base of support . Nearly 20 countries help us in Somalia . There was a question from the United Kingdom . May I first express our appreciation to one of Sir Jeremy's colleagues , Anthony Beattie , who is our Executive Board President this year . He has extraordinary competence and effectiveness and is very bright . The question was about structural issues . Clearly , there are structural issues at every level . There are structural issues that affect the family farmer , that affect the marketing operation and that affect the system in which agriculture can survive and thrive . The representative of the United Kingdom raised the question about what the Security Council can do . It is much the same question as the President raised . First of all , I think what the Council can do is to help put the humanitarian issues – food is one of them , and there are many – at the centre of the world's agenda . Humanitarian issues are security issues . If people are treated in a humane way and have the basic ingredients that lead to a life of hope , opportunity , fulfilment , the realization of potential and civil behaviour , I believe security issues will be mitigated or moderated . So what we are about has an enormous impact on families , on children and on other individuals , saving lives and propping up lives in such a way that people can begin to be productive citizens . In terms of reducing conflict , what we do is very important . We need to think more about that . I am grateful that Council members are thinking about it ; as they communicate with their capitals , this becomes part of the dialogue . Usually , we relate to the Ministry of Agriculture . That is very important . When we relate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance , we are more successful in having a stronger country partner . On the issue of the politicization of food aid , I think , strong statements on that subject from the most important political body in the world , which this Security Council is , are very powerful and very important . People have to take what Council members say seriously . It is important to make the statement that it is the basic entitlement of a person to be fed if he or she is down and out – without a personal political agenda . There is no more important place in the world for that statement to be made than right here . Food , health and education are at the base of security and at the base of a good life for individuals . We will talk more about this , and we will give members the best answer of which we are capable . It will be a good exercise for my colleagues . The representative of Spain asked a question about lessons learned . We have learned that we do indeed know how to distribute food . A couple of years ago in Ethiopia , before I was there , we did a terrific job in getting food distributed so that people did not die . We knew how to do that . We are learning how to use food as a tool for prevention and investment and development . We know how to do that . We know how important small neighbourhood groups are to getting the job done and how important remarkable community leaders are . We have also learned how difficult it is to make the case for non-food aid items . We have learned that comparable dollars invested in seed , fertilizer and farm implements in the long run have more of a pay-off than comparable dollars invested directly in food . For the life of me , I can not see why it is so much more difficult to make that case . It is beyond me . But we do know that . We have learned the value of early warning systems and of being well-informed . We know that the investments we make at the very beginning of a crisis – and the sooner we get there the better – are more powerful and have more leverage than what we do later on down the trail . We have a good paper on lessons learned , and we will share it with Council members . A question was also asked about capacity-building policy . I suspect we have not seen ourselves as capacity-builders . In Afghanistan , we did provide food to pay the compensation of 150,000 schoolteachers . They had nothing else with which to pay them in Afghanistan . We have also used food to pay for rebuilding the bureaucracy in Afghanistan . There are other examples where we have done things like that , but we generally look to the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) to provide leadership in that sphere . Here I must mention the issue of coordination and how we all work together . Rebuilding the capacity of education , agriculture and health in that part of the world is so critically important that we are all going to have to be a part of it . The representative of France asked a question about coordination . I am not going to try to answer the question generally , but may I tell you that in Southern Africa the level of cooperation has been extraordinary . All of the United Nations agencies , plus the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , the regional organization in Southern Africa , plus the International Committee for the Red Cross ( ICRC ) and non-governmental organizations , have come together into something called the United Nations Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Support Office ( RIACSO ) . This is the regional coordinating arm of the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS ( UNAIDS ) , UNDP , the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , WFP , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) ; there are about 100 people working together to coordinate and cooperate on a regional basis . The response to the initiative in the six countries is that it works superbly well . The Southern Africa crisis will be a food crisis for a few more months . I am hopeful that we will work our way out of the agricultural predicament . Going forward , there will be an enormous crisis in Southern Africa related to governance and related to HIV / AIDS . What form the lessons learned from RIACSO will take and how our work is re-formulated going forward are very important questions . Maybe , in part , this answers the question of the representative of Guinea . The representative of the Syrian Arab Republic raised a question as it relates to Iraq , and a new role for WFP . May I express our gratitude to Syria and to the Islamic Republic of Iran . Both countries have made their own food reserves available to WFP to use in Iraq , where we can borrow from them as we need it , urgently and in a timely way . We will always repay them , but having the reserve right at hand has been a blessing to us . The WFP , as I said , has been in Iraq for 12 years now . We have been a major implementer of the oil-for-food programme , directly implementing it in the north to about 4 million Kurds every day and helping to monitor it in the central and southern parts of the country . As we have been getting prepared for the conflict at hand , we have pre-positioned enough food in the countries on Iraq's perimeter to feed up to 2 million people for 30 days . So we have essentially focused on refugees or internally displaced persons who would make their way to the perimeter . We are now looking at a six-month programme that , in the first month , would focus on refugees and internally displaced persons – somewhere between 2 million and 4 million people . We are looking at ensuring that food is available in the second , third and fourth months to feed the entire population of Iraq – 27 million people . Iraq is interesting in that 60 per cent of its people rely entirely on the central Government for food , and 100 per cent of its people rely on the central Government for part of their food . The country has had a successful public distribution system , with 44,000 outlets distributing food proceeds from the oil-for-food programme . So we would look at helping to ensure that there was a steady pipeline of adequate food resources available to feed Iraq's entire population for the second , third and fourth months . As the fifth and sixth months come along , we would assume that the oil-for-food programme would be fully back in place , administered by the Government of Iraq , and that our responsibility would be to continue to look after refugees , internally displaced persons and people who are very vulnerable . We feed about 700,000 people in Iraq who are very vulnerable , including those in orphanages , pregnant women and lactating mothers . The World Food Programme is also the logistical arm of the United Nations . We run the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service , we manage the communication systems in Afghanistan – we went in with Ericsson and installed an entire communication system in Kabul – and we manage transportation , trucks and the fuel supply , among other things . As a part of the consolidated appeal process , in which the United Nations family came together to request $ 2 . 2 billion in the short term for humanitarian issues in Iraq , we have asked for $ 1 . 2 billion for food and $ 100 million for logistical activities . Under resolution 1472 ( 2003 ) , the oil-for-food resolution that the Security Council adopted a week ago Friday , the Council kindly gave us authority to have access to proceeds already encumbered through the oil-for-food programme as long as they were under transport within a period of 45 days . We have had only a short period of time in which to analyse the contracts , but our best estimate today is that $ 110 million of value will be available from the oil-for-food programme during that 45-day period to feed the people of Iraq . We are obviously very hopeful that the Council will find a way to extend the 45 days to a longer period of time and that it will address other footnote issues that are significant in terms of costs associated with transportation of those items . That means we will need to ask the donors for at least $ 1 . 1 billion in help to fund the rest of the programme , and we are in the process of doing that now . We have had dozens of conversations with many Council member countries and with all of our donors , and those conversations are going very well , if I may say so . I suspect that we have more than half of what we will need under the current negotiations , and we have people in Rome – where we have our headquarters – and , in fact , all over the world working around the clock to put this package together . The World Food Programme is a bit different in that sometimes it can take two , three or four months from the time a commitment is made until food is purchased , transported and delivered to someone . So timing is absolutely of the essence . But many countries have made generous commitments ; we now have commitments from 11 countries . And I should say that commitments come from countries that have very different views of the conflict . One of our strengths has been that we keep a narrow focus on humanitarian issues . People may have one view or another of the conflict , but no one wants human beings to starve , especially very vulnerable people who are severely at risk . So countries that have different views of the conflict will be comfortable about helping us . Last week , we had a tremendous commitment from Germany to help . I had a wonderful two days in Berlin , and I am profoundly grateful for that . My friend from Angola raised a question about the green revolution . I was saluting the Secretary-General for raising that issue and making that commitment . Worldwide , the trend is away from investment in basic agricultural infrastructure : in 1988 , the world committed $ 14 billion to that programme ; last year , it committed $ 8 billion . Now there is some good news : the United States and the United Kingdom have both begun to turn their investments around in this area . Last year , the United States committed $ 200 million more to investment in basic agricultural infrastructure than it had the year before . So the trend had been downward , but now there is a bit of hope that it is beginning to head in the other direction . With regard to the question concerning Ethiopia , I am asked , "" Jim , how can this happen again ? "" Well , our investments had been made in emergency relief as opposed to prevention and development , and I think we are beginning to learn that lesson . We are working closely with the FAO , the International Fund for Agricultural Development and other organizations . Concerning the question from the representative of China , we have had a relationship with China for 40 years , and it is an extraordinary success story . China is one of the great success stories in the world in terms of letting the market function ; hundreds of millions of people there who were not fed years ago are now fed . The agencies of the United Nations do work well together ; we cooperate on these issues , and the notion of capacity for self-reliance is basic . Mr. President , when I tried to address the question of the representative of the United Kingdom , I tried to answer your question as well , but we will provide a thoughtful answer as to what the Council could do to help us and how we could work more closely together . I am grateful for the offer , and we will try to provide a good answer . The President ( spoke in Spanish ) : I thank Mr. Morris for his comments and his responses to questions raised concerning the subject of this afternoon's meeting . I should also like to thank him most especially for his willingness to respond to questions related to other items that were not on the agenda , in particular the situation in Iraq . In that connection , various countries members of the Security Council have expressed interest in the possibility that , in the near future , the Council might be able to continue to engage in dialogue with Mr. Morris on the situation in Iraq and on the role that the World Food Programme will play . The presidency will consult with other Council members and with Mr. Morris to consider the possibility that , in the near future – before his return to the Programme's headquarters in Rome – he could meet in consultations with the Council in that regard . There are no further speakers on my list . The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda . The meeting rose at 5.10 p. m . This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages . The final text will be printed in the Official Records of the Security Council . Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only . They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service , room C-154A ."	0

498	"Many in Croatia regard Gen Gotovina as a national hero The Vatican is helping Croatia's most wanted war crimes suspect evade capture , a top UN prosecutor alleges . Carla del Ponte , chief prosecutor for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia , has said she believes Gen Ante Gotovina is hiding in a monastery in Croatia . Ms del Ponte's spokeswoman told the BBC News website that the Vatican had refused to help in the search for him , despite being in a position to do so . A spokesman for the Croatian Catholic Church rejected the charges . In a statement later the Vatican said that Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo , responsible for the city-state's foreign relations , had asked Ms del Ponte for further details of her assertions . Chief spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Ms del Ponte had not yet responded to requests for further information . Divided opinions Gen Gotovina has been charged with the deaths of 150 Serb civilians in 1995 . Earlier this year , the European Union cited Zagreb's failure to arrest him as the reason behind delaying talks on Croatia's entry into the bloc . Forces under Gen Gotovina's command are accused of killing scores of Serbs and expelling up to 200,000 from the Krajina region , now part of Croatia . Many in Croatia regard him as a national hero . Ms del Ponte wants the authorities to act against war criminals Croatian authorities have insisted they are doing everything in their power to deliver Gen Gotovina to the UN's war crimes tribunal in the Hague . The Croatian Bishops' Conference , which heads the Croatian Roman Catholic Church , dismissed Ms del Ponte's allegations . Its spokesman Antun Suljic said the conference "" has no knowledge or indications of the whereabouts "" of Gen Gotovina . Vatican ' refusal ' Ms del Ponte wrote to Pope Benedict XVI in July this year in an effort to secure the Vatican's co-operation , her spokeswoman told the BBC News website . The Pope has yet to reply to the prosecutor's request for a meeting , the spokeswoman said . Ms del Ponte earlier told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph she believed Gen Gotovina was "" hiding in a Franciscan monastery and so the Catholic Church is protecting him "" . "" I have taken this up with the Vatican and the Vatican totally refuses to co-operate with us , "" she said . Archbishop Lajolo told Ms del Ponte the Vatican did not know of Gen Gotovina's whereabouts and was not obliged to help her , she was quoted as saying . Her spokeswoman , Florence Hartmann , told the BBC News website that "" the law applies to everyone , including the Vatican "" . She said UN prosecutors faced similar difficulties in tracking down the Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic , who is thought to have sought refuge among Orthodox Christian monks in Montenegro .

1408	"Recap – Burn Notice 4.03 "" Made Man "" This episode of Burn Notice starts where we expect to see our spies have a meeting .... a bar . Sam and Fiona begin to argue that Jesse is not fit for their team while Michael gives him the benefit of the doubt . Jesse shows up during the argument with drinks and soon changes Sams mind about being on the team . Jesse begins to talk to the others about why he came to Miami and tells them that he has information about some illegal weapons trade but his only source on this is from a person he calls "" Cobra "" . Sam is not enthused by the name . Michael decides that maybe this is worth investigating . The gang arrives at the dock to scope out what exactly they are dealing with . They find it is tough to get any info from any of the dock workers about where the ships with the weapons have come from . While talking with Fiona and Michael , Jesse notices a dock security guard getting beat up . He says he has seen this before and wants to finally end this . Michael tells Jesse it 's not worth blowing cover to help a civilian . Jesse does n't listen and goes over to help . Through a fake car accident story , Jesse gets the security guard to safety and disarms the two men who were beating up the guard . Michael and Fiona find Jesse talking with Hank ( security guard ) . Hank tells them that the men who attacked him work for the mob and have been pressuring him and other guards to steal items from containers at the dock . Hank says the police have no effect , as one guard who went to the police was soon murdered . Jesse quickly wants to help out and Michael reluctantly decides to make Hank the new client . While walking to the car , Michael berates Jesse for his fast acting with no planning style of work and Michael believes that Hank is being put at risk while he is being helped by the spies . Jesse disagrees . Not wanting to argue , Michael decides the best way to attack the situation is to get some information on the mob they are dealing with . Cut to a bar downtown , Sam shows Michael the information he obtained from a "" police buddy "" on mob members in Miami . The bar turns out to be the mobs place to drink . Michael is surprised to see a mob bar look so normal . We see a man come walking out of the bar and Sam informs Michael this is Tony Carro , a mob boss who runs some business in Florida for a mob in New York . Sam quickly runs through Tonys profile and sees that Tony's record is for the most part clean . Back at the Westen house , Jesse and Michaels Mother , Madeline , are cooking up some food . Madeline remarks that she knows nothing about Jesse . She makes observations that Jesse must have been a government worker as he never parks his car in the same place and always exits the house through a different door . Michael enters the house and Jesse tells Madeline that Michael is there for him . Madeline leaves slightly angry . The two men begin to talk about the plan to take down the mob in Miami . In Michael's apartment , Michael begins creating a listening device out of gum , a tissue , and some lint ( Michael , in a voice-over , states that the best "" bug "" is something that people do n't want to touch ) . Sam enters with an alias for Michael to use during the plan . The identity he is using is a suspended FBI agent named Ned Gorden . Sam has everything that Michael needs to assume the identity , to which Michael seems very pleased . We next see Michael getting escorted into the mob bar to see Tony . Before talking to Michael , Tony is yelling at a store owner who is selling the stolen merchandise Tony gets . The owner is late on some money and Tony is threatening to kill him if not payed back . Before leaving , the owner agrees to pay by the afternoon . Michael is brought in to see Tony . Tony states he has seen Michael standing outside for many days . Michael asks Tony how much info on Tony would be worth if Michael told others . Michael is thrown to the table and it 's there Tonys guard pulls out Michael's fake FBI badge . Michael creates the cover story as being a drunk . Tony agrees to meet with Michael at 4 : 00 . Before leaving , Tony tells Michael to never return to the bar again . Cut to the underside of a bridge . Michael is waiting for Tony to show up while Jesse and Fiona keep watch . We see two men approach , but neither of them are Tony . One of the men explains that they know Michael is not Agent Gorden and the men begin to attack Michael . Fiona and Jesse argue over taking a shot to kill or not kill the men . Fiona does not want to shoot . Michael quickly cripples the man holding his arms and uses that man to disarm the other man with a gun . Michael walks away while Jesse remarks that Michael can really hold his own . Outside of the mob bar , Sam , Michael and Jesse watch Tony from inside Michael's car . Sam shows Michael a tape of how Michael was ousted as not being a FBI agent . Michael questions why they are back at the bar then . Sam points to a man talking to Tony . His name is Gio and he is part of the mob family that works in New York . Gio is down here to "" squeeze "" Tony . The three men listen to Gio and Tony argue and decide to push Tony in a direction that will get Tony out of Hanks way for good . It 's then we are reintroduced to an old Sam character named "" Chuck Finley "" . Jesse meets with Hank and Hank states that he ca n't stay away from work too much longer as people are starting to ask questions . Jesse calms Hank by saying that everything will be fine and that it 's being taken care of . Hank in favor gives Jesse a stack of papers from the dock showing every shipment from Nigeria in the last few months . Back at the Westen house , Jesse is sifting through the paper for clues as to who "" Cobra "" is . Madeline enters the room to giver Jesse some items that Michael does n't use anymore . Madeline finds a picture of Jesse's Mother lying on the bed . The two begin talking about Jesse's mom and Jesse tells the story of how his mom died when he was 9 . Jesse receives a call from Sam , and Jesse agrees to meet with Sam in a few minutes . Tony is sitting in a nice night club . Tony makes his way to the bathroom and shoos his guards away . In the bathroom room , Sam has fogged the mirrors and locked all the toilet stalls but one . As Tony goes to sit on the open toilet , Sam attacks Tony and sedates him to the point of unconsciousness . Jesse and Sam quickly change Tonys clothing and whisk him out of the bar , claiming he is a man who ca n't hold his alcohol .

194	Second regular session 2002 23 to 27 September 2002 , New York Item 7 of the provisional agenda UNOPS : Financial , budgetary and administrative matters Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Executive Director of the United Nations Office for Project Services on the implementation of the revised budget for 2002 , on the revised budget estimates for the biennium 2002-2003 and on the level of the operational reserve ( DP / 2002 / 33 ) . The Committee also had before it , as background documentation , a conference room paper on UNOPS revised budget estimates for the year 2002 ( DP / 2002 / CRP . 10 ) , a report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors for the biennium 2000-2001 ( DP / 2002 / 35 ) , an action plan on savings from projected staff cuts ( DP / 2002 / 35 / Add . 1 ) , an advance copy of the UNOPS contingency plan for 2002-2003 ( DP / 2002 / 35 / Add . 2 ) and draft terms of reference and timetable for an independent review of UNOPS ( DP / 2002 / 36 ) . During its consideration of these matters , the Committee met with the Executive Director of UNOPS and his colleagues , who provided additional information . The Advisory Committee notes that the projection of income and expenditures of UNOPS during the biennium 2002-2003 has taken place under circumstances that have seriously impacted on the working of that Office . The Advisory Committee notes with concern the serious situation facing the management and operation of UNOPS . The Committee was informed that the massive reduction of business from UNDP that started in 1999 continued during the biennium 2000-2001 and the year 2002 ( see annex 1 to this report ) . Income from UNDP decreased from $ 79 . 4 million in the biennium 1998-1999 ( or some 92 percent of total project income of UNOPS ) to $ 61 . 5 million in the biennium 2000-2001 ( or 82 percent of total project income ) . However , UNDP remains UNOPS ' largest client since the latter's inception in 1994 ( see report of the Board of Auditors to the General Assembly on the accounts of UNOPS for the biennium ended 31 December 2001 , para . 25 and Annex 2 to this report ) . The Advisory Committee was informed that the UNOPS ' delivery dropped considerably in 2001 and consequently its income from project delivery . The budget approved for 2001 ( Executive Board decision 2001 / 19 ) projected a total income of $ 56 . 8 million and total administrative expenditures of $ 55 . 3 million . Actual income for 2001 amounted however to only $ 47 . 2 million or $ 9 . 6 million less than the projected income . Administrative expenditures totaled $ 52 . 8 million , exceeding total income by $ 5 . 6 million . UNOPS covered this shortfall in income through a drawdown on the operational reserve , in accordance with its Financial Regulations , reducing its level to $ 5 million ( DP / 2002 / CRP . 10 ) . The Advisory Committee was also informed that the performance of UNOPS in 2001 was significantly affected , inter alia , by the uncertainty about its future status . The review by the Secretary-General on the operations and continuity of UNOPS , requested in March 2001 , was completed in January 2002 when the Secretary-General took the decision to maintain UNOPS as a separate and identifiable entity of the United Nations system that is self-financing , as originally intended by Member States . The Committee was provided with the note of the Secretary-General on the matter ( DP / 2002 / CRP . 5 ) . The Committee notes that in reaching its decision , the Secretary-General was assisted by the internal review carried out , at his request , by the Office of Internal Oversight Services ( OIOS ) . The Committee recalls that in paragraph 4 of its report DP / 2001 / 29 of 5 September 2001 , it indicated that it was incumbent on the Secretary-General to inform Member States expeditiously on the results of the review . The Committee reiterates its request that the Secretary-General make available to Member States the report of OIOS on UNOPS . Furthermore , the Advisory Committee believes that , in supporting the continued work of UNOPS , as a separate and identifiable entity that provides services to organizations of the United Nations system for the management and delivery of programmes and projects , it is incumbent upon the Secretary-General to take steps to ensure the viability and success of UNOPS . The Advisory Committee recalls that it had also expressed its concern that the prolonged deliberations regarding the future status of UNOPS would have negative impact on its operations , resulting in lower levels of acquisition and delivery ( DP / 2001 / 29 , para . The Committee was informed that during 2001 the uncertainty regarding the existence of UNOPS had led to a decrease in UNOPS ' key businesses , including cancellation or delays of approved project budgets funded by UNDP in an amount of $ 42 million . The Advisory Committee is concerned that , through no fault of UNOPS , it has not been able to recover fully from UNDP the costs of activities carried out in good faith , with a view to performing the tasks specified in the work plans of approved projects which were subsequently delayed , modified , or cancelled . The Committee recalls that , with respect to the termination or postponement of project budgets , it had indicated that this should be managed through consultation of all parties concerned and in such a way as to minimize the financial consequences and their impact on UNOPS ( DP / 2001 / 29 , para . In this connection , the Committee recommends that the Administrator of UNDP review the issue so as to reimburse UNOPS in an equitable manner for the costs incurred . ( See paragraph . 9 below . The Advisory Committee notes that the Secretary-General decided to maintain the Management Coordination Committee ( MCC ) , chaired by the UNDP Administrator ( see DP / 2002 / CRP . 5 , paras . 7 to 15 ) . The Committee has indicated that the relationships of UNOPS with the entities involved in governing , servicing and advising it are complex and that , at times , may hinder the effective communication and reporting systems of UNOPS ( DP / 1994 / 57 , paras . 3 and 4 ) . In the Committee's opinion , the responsibilities currently assigned to the MCC appear to establish another layer of executive management for UNOPS ; as initially endorsed by the Executive Board , the MCC was established to provide overall oversight and guidance to UNOPS , as a self-financing entity . The Committee was informed that actions taken by the MCC in management of UNOPS have resulted , at times , in unnecessary and costly delays . For example , the Committee was informed that , in the last quarter of 2001 , it had become clear that expenditure reductions on non-staff related items would not be sufficient to balance the budget . Both the approved budget and the staffing strength of UNOPS were in excess of the income that was being generated . Had the MCC agreed with staff reduction measures in November 2001 rather than in February 2002 , the downward adjustment would have been less painful and savings in 2002 could have been larger . With regard to budget for 2002 , the Advisory Committee was informed that in June 2002 , the Management Coordination Committee ( MCC ) decided to revise the approved budget of $ 56 . 5 million downward to a ceiling of $ 44 million . The 2002 revised budget is based on business already acquired but excluding new business in the advanced pipeline that would be signed and implemented during the course of the year . The Advisory Committee remains concerned that the Executive Director of UNOPS has not been given the flexibility needed to manage the organization to react to changes in the fluctuations in delivery of the project portfolio and other services . In this connection , the Committee recalls its comments on the role of the MCC made in its report of 7 October 1994 ( DP / 1994 / 57 , paras . 13 and 14 ) and reiterates its recommendation made in its report of 18 September 2000 ( DP / 2000 / 38 , para . 18 ) on the need to streamline the budget preparation and review process . To this end , the current role of the MCC in setting a budgetary ceiling should be reconsidered with a view to conforming the procedure for the preparation and submission of the UNOPS budget to that followed by the UN Funds and Programmes . The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of document DP / 2002 / 36 that the scope of the proposed independent review of UNOPS would include a review of the revenue and cost structures of UNOPS , its operating margins on products and services , as well as its business processes and management tools at hand . The Committee notes that the estimated cost of this review amounts to $ 200 , 000 and would be completed in 90 days . The Committee welcomes this review , which is in line with its recommendations in paragraphs 2 and 3 of its report DP / 2001 / 29 of 5 September 2001 . The Committee stresses that although UNOPS should continue its efforts to be a cost-effective and competitive provider of services to clients within the United Nations system , it should recover in full from its clients the actual costs of executing projects and providing services . The Committee also reiterates its view that UNOPS should continue its efforts to examine the structure of its business with a view to refining the criteria taken into account to evaluate the commitment of clients and UNOPS ' own capacity to deliver . To ensure an expeditious completion of the independent review , the Secretary-General should make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its costs are met . The Advisory Committee notes that , in document DP / 2002 / 35 / Add . 2 , an attempt has been made to formulate a contingency plan for UNOPS in response to Executive Board decision 2002 / 13 . The plan includes actions to be taken by the Executive Director in the event that the operational reserve is unable to absorb administrative expenditures incurred against the UNOPS account for the biennium 2002-2003 . In the Committee's opinion some of the steps proposed in paragraphs 9 to 14 to increase income and reduce administrative expenditure are already within the purview of management authority of the Executive Director of UNOPS and do not necessarily form part of a contingency plan related to the level operational reserve . Moreover , some of the proposed actions should also be closely examined in the proposed internal review of UNOPS ( see paragraph 9 above ) . These would include , for example , the question of the rights and obligations of UNOPS and its clients pursuant to contractual arrangements for project delivery ( see paragraph 5 above ) . On the question of the future status of UNDP personnel working with UNOPS and respective liabilities of UNDP and UNOPS the Advisory Committee was informed that the prevalence of staff in UNOPS with differences in contractual status hampers UNOPS ' ability to be responsive to the self-financing principle . Categories include UNDP permanent staff expected to return to UNDP , UNDP staff with contracts limited to UNOPS , and UNOPS staff . In addition , the personnel arrangements with UNDP of 1994 are no longer valid and UNOPS has agreed with UNDP to revise them in order to fit their current and future anticipated relationship . UNDP and UNOPS have agreed on a cost-sharing formula applicable to UNDP staff that have been serving with UNOPS and need to be separated as a result of abolition of posts . However , UNDP's precarious financial situation has led UNDP to take certain decisions that are not reciprocal to that which is expected from UNOPS . The Advisory Committee has commented in the past on the need to re-examine UNOPS contracts for personnel services in order to have a flexible post management system that would allow UNOPS to expand and contract its capacity in response to changes in demand and project delivery and income . The Committee has also recognized that the demand for UNOPS services is increasingly calling for specialized capacity for the management of multi-disciplinary initiatives and that UNOPS must respond quickly , efficiently and in the most cost-effective manner ( see , for example , DP / 2000 / 38 , paras . 14 to 17 ) . The Committee trusts that the internal review of UNOPS will include the re-examination of these personnel issues . Implementation of the approved budget for 2002 In its decision 2002 / 13 , paragraph 6 , the Executive Board approved the 2002 administrative budget in the amount of $ 44 million on the basis of a total income projected at $ 44 . 3 million and a project delivery portfolio of $ 503 . 2 million . The Committee notes that at the end of July 2002 , project delivery had reached $ 320 . 4 million , generating income in the amount of $ 22 . 5 million . Total income , including service income for loan administration , was $ 26 . 9 million and administrative expenditure amounted to $ 26 . 4 million at the end of July 2002 ( DP / 2002 / 33 , paras . 3 to 6 ) . The Advisory Committee was informed that the latest available figures indicate that UNOPS is on track or even slightly ahead on delivery and income ; however , staff related costs have increased about 7.5 per cent as compared with the pro-forma costs used in the budget , as a result mainly of currency fluctuations of the dollar vis-a-vis the Euro and other currencies . This situation may lead to overspending the approved administrative budget by some $ 250 , 000 , or one half of one percent of the approved budget , if measures for further cost containment and possible additional income turn out to be insufficient to compensate for this cost escalation in the personnel component of the budget . Revised budget estimates for 2003 The Advisory Committee was informed that , for 2003 , the MCC had initially set a revised target of $ 41 million , expressed in 2002 dollars ( as compared with approved total of $ 56 . 5 million . ) Given the increases for staff related costs and the need to set aside $ 1 million for a post-IMIS business information system , the MCC approved a budget ceiling for 2003 at the same level as for 2002 of $ 44 million . The budget submitted by the Executive Director of UNOPS amounts to $ 43 . 9 million and is based on the assumption that the delivery of project portfolio will amount to $ 513 million , reflecting an increase $ 9 . 8 million or 1.9 per cent over the estimate for 2002 of $ 503 . 2 million . Total income is projected at $ 44 . 7 million , comprising $ 36 . 4 million from project delivery , $ 6 . 9 million from service income , including services provided to IFAD , and $ 1 . 4 million from other income , including income from existing and planned agreements with a number of United Nations organizations for the subletting of office space and the provision of associated services at UNOPS headquarters ( DP / 2002 / 33 , paras . 12 to 17 and table 1 ) . The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 16 of document DP / 2002 / 33 that the need to invest in information technology in the amount of $ 1 million in 2003 is a consequence of the decision by UNDP to implement a new Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) system , effective 1 January 2004 . The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the budget proposal of the Executive Director for 2003 . The level of the operational reserve As indicated in paragraph 3 above , at the end of the biennium 2000-2001 , the operational reserve was reduced to $ 5 . 0 million . The direct charge to the operational reserve to cover estimated staff separation in 2002 is estimated at $ 2 million ( DP / 2002 / 33 , para . 18 and table 1 ) . A total of 44 staff members have been affected by the staff reduction exercise in 2002 ( see DP / 2002 / 35 / Add . 1 , para . 8 and table 1 ) . In light of the estimated over-expenditure of $ 250 , 000 in 2002 ( see paragraph 13 above ) and the projected excess of income over expenditure of $ 800 , 000 in 2003 , the Committee was informed that the operational reserve level would amount to some $ 3 . 5 million by the end of 2003 . However , in 2003 and 2004 UNOPS medium-term strategy also foresees subletting one fourth of its office space in 2003 and one half from 2004 onwards , allowing the organization to generate additional income , as a result of staff reductions and decentralization measures to move operations to lower cost duty stations . * ) Since 1997 , has included an increasing number of Management Services Agreements negotiated with non-UN funding sources such as International Financial Institutions and governments , where UNDP assumes the function of funds manager and UNOPS is charged with execution .	8
896	"An Improvement on Jacob's Ladder In the morning of the day after that on which I swore my oath against the Six , I gave certain orders , and then rested in greater contentment than I had known for some time . I was at work ; and work , though it can not cure love , is yet a narcotic to it ; so that Sapt , who grew feverish , marvelled to see me sprawling in an armchair in the sunshine , listening to one of my friends who sang me amorous songs in a mellow voice and induced in me a pleasing melancholy . Thus was I engaged when young Rupert Hentzau , who feared neither man nor devil , and rode through the demesne – where every tree might hide a marksman , for all he knew – as though it had been the park at Strelsau , cantered up to where I lay , bowing with burlesque deference , and craving private speech with me in order to deliver a message from the Duke of Strelsau . I made all withdraw , and then he said , seating himself by me : "" The King is in love , it seems ? "" "" Not with life , my lord , "" said I , smiling . "" It is well , "" he rejoined . "" Come , we are alone , Rassendyll – "" I rose to a sitting posture . "" What 's the matter ? "" he asked . "" I was about to call one of my gentlemen to bring your horse , my lord . If you do not know how to address the King , my brother must find another messenger . "" "" Why keep up the farce ? "" he asked , negligently dusting his boot with his glove . "" Because it is not finished yet ; and meanwhile I 'll choose my own name . "" "" Oh , so be it ! Yet I spoke in love for you ; for indeed you are a man after my own heart . "" "" Saving my poor honesty , "" said I , "" maybe I am . But that I keep faith with men , and honour with women , maybe I am , my lord . "" He darted a glance at me – a glance of anger . "" Is your mother dead ? "" said I. "" Ay , she 's dead . "" "" She may thank God , "" said I , and I heard him curse me softly . "" Well , what 's the message ? "" I continued . I had touched him on the raw , for all the world knew he had broken his mother's heart and flaunted his mistresses in her house ; and his airy manner was gone for the moment . "" The duke offers you more than I would , "" he growled . "" A halter for you , sire , was my suggestion . But he offers you safe-conduct across the frontier and a million crowns . "" "" I prefer your offer , my lord , if I am bound to one . "" "" You refuse ? "" "" Of course . "" "" I told Michael you would ; "" and the villain , his temper restored , gave me the sunniest of smiles . "" The fact is , between ourselves , "" he continued , "" Michael does n't understand a gentleman . "" I began to laugh . "" And you ? "" I asked . "" I do , "" he said . "" Well , well , the halter be it . "" "" I 'm sorry you wo n't live to see it , "" I observed . "" Has his Majesty done me the honour to fasten a particular quarrel on me ? "" "" I would you were a few years older , though . "" "" Oh , God gives years , but the devil gives increase , "" laughed he . "" I can hold my own . "" "" How is your prisoner ? "" I asked . "" The K – ? "" "" Your prisoner . "" "" I forgot your wishes , sire . Well , he is alive . "" He rose to his feet ; I imitated him . Then , with a smile , he said : "" And the pretty princess ? Faith , I 'll wager the next Elphberg will be red enough , for all that Black Michael will be called his father . "" I sprang a step towards him , clenching my hand . He did not move an inch , and his lip curled in insolent amusement . "" Go , while your skin's whole ! "" I muttered . He had repaid me with interest my hit about his mother . Then came the most audacious thing I have known in my life . My friends were some thirty yards away . Rupert called to a groom to bring him his horse , and dismissed the fellow with a crown . The horse stood near . I stood still , suspecting nothing . Rupert made as though to mount ; then he suddenly turned to me : his left hand resting in his belt , his right outstretched : "" Shake hands , "" he said . I bowed , and did as he had foreseen – I put my hands behind me . Quicker than thought , his left hand darted out at me , and a small dagger flashed in the air ; he struck me in the left shoulder – had I not swerved , it had been my heart . With a cry , I staggered back . Without touching the stirrup , he leapt upon his horse and was off like an arrow , pursued by cries and revolver shots – the last as useless as the first – and I sank into my chair , bleeding profusely , as I watched the devil's brat disappear down the long avenue . My friends surrounded me , and then I fainted . I suppose that I was put to bed , and there lay , unconscious , or half conscious , for many hours ; for it was night when I awoke to my full mind , and found Fritz beside me . I was weak and weary , but he bade me be of good cheer , saying that my wound would soon heal , and that meanwhile all had gone well , for Johann , the keeper , had fallen into the snare we had laid for him , and was even now in the house . "" And the queer thing is , "" pursued Fritz , "" that I fancy he 's not altogether sorry to find himself here . He seems to think that when Black Michael has brought off his coup , witnesses of how it was effected – saving , of course , the Six themselves – will not be at a premium . "" This idea argued a shrewdness in our captive which led me to build hopes on his assistance . I ordered him to be brought in at once . Sapt conducted him , and set him in a chair by my bedside . He was sullen , and afraid ; but , to say truth , after young Rupert's exploit , we also had our fears , and , if he got as far as possible from Sapt's formidable six-shooter , Sapt kept him as far as he could from me . Moreover , when he came in his hands were bound , but that I would not suffer . I need not stay to recount the safeguards and rewards we promised the fellow – all of which were honourably observed and paid , so that he lives now in prosperity ( though where I may not mention ) ; and we were the more free inasmuch as we soon learnt that he was rather a weak man than a wicked , and had acted throughout this matter more from fear of the duke and of his own brother Max than for any love of what was done . But he had persuaded all of his loyalty ; and though not in their secret counsels , was yet , by his knowledge of their dispositions within the Castle , able to lay bare before us the very heart of their devices . And here , in brief , is his story : Below the level of the ground in the Castle , approached by a flight of stone steps which abutted on the end of the drawbridge , were situated two small rooms , cut out of the rock itself . The outer of the two had no windows , but was always lighted with candles ; the inner had one square window , which gave upon the moat . In the outer room there lay always , day and night , three of the Six ; and the instructions of Duke Michael were , that on any attack being made on the outer room , the three were to defend the door of it so long as they could without risk to themselves . But , so soon as the door should be in danger of being forced , then Rupert Hentzau or Detchard ( for one of these two was always there ) should leave the others to hold it as long as they could , and himself pass into the inner room , and , without more ado , kill the King who lay there , well-treated indeed , but without weapons , and with his arms confined in fine steel chains , which did not allow him to move his elbow more than three inches from his side . Thus , before the outer door were stormed , the King would be dead . And his body ? For his body would be evidence as damning as himself . "" Nay , sir , "" said Johann , "" his Highness has thought of that . While the two hold the outer room , the one who has killed the King unlocks the bars in the square window ( they turn on a hinge ) . The window now gives no light , for its mouth is choked by a great pipe of earthenware ; and this pipe , which is large enough to let pass through it the body of a man , passes into the moat , coming to an end immediately above the surface of the water , so that there is no perceptible interval between water and pipe . The King being dead , his murderer swiftly ties a weight to the body , and , dragging it to the window , raises it by a pulley ( for , lest the weight should prove too great , Detchard has provided one ) till it is level with the mouth of the pipe . He inserts the feet in the pipe , and pushes the body down . Silently , without splash or sound , it falls into the water and thence to the bottom of the moat , which is twenty feet deep thereabouts . This done , the murderer cries loudly , "" All 's well ! "" and himself slides down the pipe ; and the others , if they can and the attack is not too hot , run to the inner room and , seeking a moment's delay , bar the door , and in their turn slide down . And though the King rises not from the bottom , they rise and swim round to the other side , where the orders are for men to wait them with ropes , to haul them out , and horses . And here , if things go ill , the duke will join them and seek safety by riding ; but if all goes well , they will return to the Castle , and have their enemies in a trap . That , sir , is the plan of his Highness for the disposal of the King in case of need . But it is not to be used till the last ; for , as we all know , he is not minded to kill the King unless he can , before or soon after , kill you also , sir . Now , sir , I have spoken the truth , as God is my witness , and I pray you to shield me from the vengeance of Duke Michael ; for if , after he knows what I have done , I fall into his hands , I shall pray for one thing out of all the world – a speedy death , and that I shall not obtain from him ! "" The fellow's story was rudely told , but our questions supplemented his narrative . What he had told us applied to an armed attack ; but if suspicions were aroused , and there came overwhelming force – such , for instance , as I , the King , could bring – the idea of resistance would be abandoned ; the King would be quietly murdered and slid down the pipe . And – here comes an ingenious touch – one of the Six would take his place in the cell , and , on the entrance of the searchers , loudly demand release and redress ; and Michael , being summoned , would confess to hasty action , but he would say the man had angered him by seeking the favour of a lady in the Castle ( this was Antoinette de Mauban ) and he had confined him there , as he conceived he , as Lord of Zenda , had right to do . But he was now , on receiving his apology , content to let him go , and so end the gossip which , to his Highness's annoyance , had arisen concerning a prisoner in Zenda , and had given his visitors the trouble of this enquiry . The visitors , baffled , would retire , and Michael could , at his leisure , dispose of the body of the King . Sapt , Fritz , and I in my bed , looked round on one another in horror and bewilderment at the cruelty and cunning of the plan . Whether I went in peace or in war , openly at the head of a corps , or secretly by a stealthy assault , the King would be dead before I could come near him . If Michael were stronger and overcame my party , there would be an end . But if I were stronger , I should have no way to punish him , no means of proving any guilt in him without proving my own guilt also . On the other hand , I should be left as King ( ah ! for a moment my pulse quickened ) and it would be for the future to witness the final struggle between him and me . He seemed to have made triumph possible and ruin impossible . At the worst , he would stand as well as he had stood before I crossed his path – with but one man between him and the throne , and that man an impostor ; at best , there would be none left to stand against him . I had begun to think that Black Michael was over fond of leaving the fighting to his friends ; but now I acknowledged that the brains , if not the arms , of the conspiracy were his . "" Does the King know this ? "" I asked . "" I and my brother , "" answered Johann , "" put up the pipe , under the orders of my Lord of Hentzau . He was on guard that day , and the King asked my lord what it meant . "" Faith , "" he answered , with his airy laugh , "" it 's a new improvement on the ladder of Jacob , whereby , as you have read , sire , men pass from the earth to heaven . We thought it not meet that your Majesty should go , in case , sire , you must go , by the common route . So we have made you a pretty private passage where the vulgar can not stare at you or incommode your passage . That , sire , is the meaning of that pipe . "" And he laughed and bowed , and prayed the King's leave to replenish the King's glass – for the King was at supper . And the King , though he is a brave man , as are all of his House , grew red and then white as he looked on the pipe and at the merry devil who mocked him . Ah , sir "" ( and the fellow shuddered ) , "" it is not easy to sleep quiet in the Castle of Zenda , for all of them would as soon cut a man's throat as play a game at cards ; and my Lord Rupert would choose it sooner for a pastime than any other – ay , sooner than he would ruin a woman , though that he loves also . "" The man ceased , and I bade Fritz take him away and have him carefully guarded ; and , turning to him , I added : "" If anyone asks you if there is a prisoner in Zenda , you may answer "" Yes . "" But if any asks who the prisoner is , do not answer . For all my promises will not save you if any man here learns from you the truth as to the prisoner of Zenda . I 'll kill you like a dog if the thing be so much as breathed within the house ! "" Then , when he was gone , I looked at Sapt . "" It 's a hard nut ! "" said I. "" So hard , "" said he , shaking his grizzled head , "" that as I think , this time next year is like to find you still King of Ruritania ! "" and he broke out into curses on Michael's cunning . I lay back on my pillows . "" There seems to me , "" I observed , "" to be two ways by which the King can come out of Zenda alive . One is by treachery in the duke's followers . "" "" You can leave that out , "" said Sapt . "" I hope not , "" I rejoined , "" because the other I was about to mention is – by a miracle from heaven ! """	6

789	Operating system : NLTSS , VMS , UNIX , MAC OS , DOS . Keywords : Boltzmann equation , Electron distribution , Transport coeffcients , Physics laser , Plasma physics , Gas discharges , Kinetic model . Classification : 19.8 , 19.11 . Nature of problem : ELENDIF calculates the time evolution of the electron energy distribution function in a mixture of partially ionized gases with or without an applied electric field . The code can treat inelastic and superelastic processes , electron-electron and electron-ion collisions , photon-electron ( free-free ) processes , attachment and recombination , ionization including a distribution of secondary electrons , and an external source of electrons ( e.g. an electron beam ) . The code also computes the mean electron energy , drift velocity , diffusion coefficient , rate coefficients and energy flow rates for the processes being included in the calculation . Solution method : ELENDIF solves the time-dependent Boltzmann transport equation in terms of the electron number density . By finite-differencing the electron energy axis , the Boltzmann equation is transformed into a finite set of coupled differential equations for the electron number density at each energy grid as a function of time . The matrix of densities is then evolved forward in time using a combination of explicit and implicit methods . The electron energy distribution is then convolved with the cross section to provide the transport coefficients , collisional rates and energy flow rates . Restrictions : It is assumed in the formulation of ELENDIF that the two-term spherical harmonic expansion of the electron distribution function is adequate . Running time : On the Vax 8650 the code takes 0.11 seconds per timestep if the effects of electron-electron collisions are ignored , and 0.46 seconds per timestep if electron-electron collisions are included .	3
431	"THE QUESTION IN SCOTLAND FIFTY YEARS AGO . I. One of my earliest recollections is the rattle of the muskets when a company of soldiers , marched into Easter Ross to keep down the excited population in 1843 , grounded their arms in the High Street of the old burgh of Tain . They were drawn up in front of the grey tower on the Castle hill , which half hid the long blue line of Sutherlandshire hills , while far to the right our horizon showed the ruined Keep of Lochslin , the birthplace of the Bloody Mackenzie . It was the centre of a district in which the display of some military force had become necessary . About a year before , the Church of Scotland had solemnly undertaken to disestablish itself ; and that promise had now to be fulfilled , but by a very different process from the comfortable euthanasia of retaining a life-interest in the benefices . Most of the Northern ministers adhered to their pledge ; but each of them still held that the church of the parish belonged to its congregation , and the congregations ( who were with them almost unanimously ) held still more strongly that the manse ought to be left with the outgoing minister . That was not to be . It was found not easy to drive the Gaelic congregations from the low grey walls of the Easter Ross churches , each surrounded by the generations of its dead . And though it was easy enough to send out from his home each minister and his family , the actual accomplishment of this , which was now going on , filled every household in the Highlands with a dangerous mixture of anguish and indignation . In this particular district there were special reasons for strong feeling . The people were not under the control of one great proprietor , ducal or otherwise ; but still there were attempts to terrorise . A powerful landholder in the neighbourhood announced that no labourer should be permitted to do a stroke of work on his estates , unless on the previous Sunday he had attended the religious service provided by the State . The labourers , backed by their friends in the towns , stood shoulder to shoulder , and escaped the whole evil so threatened . But their spiritual leaders , the ministers in town and country , did not escape from any part of what had hung over them . Accordingly , a stranger scene than even that which Ross-shire peasants and burghers now gazed upon had been transacted a few days before in the metropolis of Scotland . It was a grey and cloudy afternoon on the ridge of the new town of Edinburgh , where masses of spectators gathered in breathless expectation round the tall spire of St. Andrew's Church . Into its interior , crowded since early dawn with a like eager multitude , the members of Assembly and the glittering cortege of the Queen's Commissioner had just disappeared . The doors were now shut , and all Scotland seemed to wait outside . Suddenly they were broken open , and a roar of acclamation rent the air as the ex-Moderator in his robes , and by his side the venerable face of Chalmers , were seen to appear . For following these two came the leaders of the Evangelical revival in the Church of Scotland from Highlands and Lowlands alike . The crowd surged in emotion around them , so as to make the old men in front the head of an involuntary procession . It took a few steps westward , and then , turning to the right , moved down the steep brow of that long slope which connects northern Edinburgh with the sea . One by one the ministers then in Edinburgh , who had resolved to cast in their lot with the Church , fell into the moving line . But after them marched a train of young men , "" licentiates "" or candidates , who had looked forward to its benefices , but who ( like all its missionaries without exception in foreign lands ) chose now to belong to this its forlorn hope . Together they set their faces to the long descent into that valley of humiliation . Before them the waters of the firth gleamed under the blue and bitter north , and beyond it stretched many a moor and strath , with the manses which the old men were in a few weeks to leave and the young men were never to enter . To one of those manses I had paid an unseasonable morning visit two months before . There was a bright March sunrise , and I had jumped early out of bed , for my head was full of marbles and peg-tops , and a dozen or so of games before breakfast has , at that age , its attractions . To my astonishment , I found my father down before me ; indeed , he had evidently been there for some time , for the moment I appeared he folded up the newspaper in which he had been so unseasonably engaged , and - with a break in his voice indicating an emotion that was unaccountable to me - asked me to take it at once over to the manse , with his compliments to his friend the minister . I went very readily , for the hedgerows were full of young birds upon whom legitimate hostilities could be waged in passing . But as I went I reflected on the austere and stately , image of our pastor , - a man everywhere venerated , but whose face inspired awe rather than love in the beholder - ( had I not seen the town-boys break and scatter round one corner of the street as he appeared at the other ? ) - and I resolved that my interview with him should be short . It was shorter than I expected , for I had scarcely got out of the sunshine into the manse evergreens , when I found him in the porch and when I offered him the newspaper , he showed me that he had already got the Times by some unusual express , and as he spoke he patted my head and smiled - but such a smile , so full of radiant kindliness ! I was confounded ; and as I went back between the hedges the birds sang unheeded while I thought what could have happened to the minister . Had anybody left him a fortune ? or had he met one of the Shining Ones walking among the hollies in that early dawn ? And it was not for some weeks that I found out that this was what had happened - the newspaper that morning had brought him the vote of the House of Commons , finally refusing an inquiry into the affairs of the Scottish Church , and so making it certain that within a few weeks he and his aged mother would leave for ever the home , at the door of which I found him . But the "" gentleness and gaiety "" of heart with which we are told , in a memorable passage of Lord Cockburn , that the country ministers faced the coming of the crisis , did not free them from having to go through with it afterwards in all its grinding detail . This was the point of one of the most striking reminiscences of Dr. Thomas Guthrie at a later date ; "" I remember passing a manse on a moonlight night , with ' the minister who had left it , for the cause of truth . No light shone from the house , and no smoke arose . Pointing to it in the moonlight , I said , ' Oh , my friend , it was a noble thing to leave that house . ' ' Ah , yes , ' he replied ; ' it was a noble thing , but for all that it was a bitter thing . I shall never forget the night I left that house till I am laid in my grave . When I saw my wife and children go forth in the gloaming ; when I saw them for the last time leave our own door ; and when in the dark I was left alone , with none but my God in that house ; and when I had to take water and quench the fire on my own hearth , and put out the candle in my own house , and turn the key against myself , and my wife , and my little ones that night - God in His mercy grant that such a night I may never again see ! "" Those who left their homes at once , as most in Ross-shire were now doing , had perhaps the best of it . But some were gladly allowed to linger on till the early Northern winter . "" One minister writes to us that he left the manse with his family in a snow storm , when the mountain was white with snow , and the sky was black with drift ; but that he never knew so much of the peace of God as he did that night , when following his wife and children as they were carted over the mountain , without knowing where they were to find a place to dwell in . Some of our ministers write that they live in crofters' houses ; some in places as damp as cellars , where a candle will not burn . One says he sits with his great coat on ; another that the curtains of his bed shake at night like the sails of a ship in a storm . One minister , a friend of mine , lives in a house which every wind of heaven blows through . On getting up one morning he found the house all comparatively comfortable , and wondered what good genius had been putting it in order , when he discovered that a heavy shower of snow had fallen , and stopped up the crevices of the roof . "" It must always be remembered that the country , and especially the Highlands , were different in this respect from the great towns , even after that first winter of 1843 . It was some years before the Northern manses were built , and homelessness , added to poverty , pressed heavily on the ejected ministers . I remember how , as a boy , I used to watch one of them , a scholarly , and in his college days a rather distinguished man , who after 1843 was unable to find a home within his own parish , and who besides now laboured under a weak chest and a threatening of heart complaint . Yet week after week , as each Sunday morning came round , he persisted in driving away for miles through those inclement winters to meet his congregation ; and I can remember to this day his keen , delicate face set to meet a heavy snow-storm from the northwest , while a hacking cough shook his whole frame as he set out on his journey , four miles of which must pass ore he caught sight of the well-sheltered and well-remembered manse . But those who , like him , found shelter in a town dwelling , however humble , were not worst off . The great difficulty was in the country , even when harbouring the minister was not forbidden by the great landlords . But in many cases , and occasionally over whole districts or counties , it was forbidden . And where a foot of ground was forbidden to the minister , as well as to his congregation , the results , always depressing to him , and cruelly distressing to his family , sometimes reached a pitch of strange and memorable oppression . I have myself often conversed with the minister of "" Small Isles "" - four inhabited rocks clustering together out in the wild Atlantic - whose ministry , forbidden on those morsels of the land , was carried on in the boat upon the billow which his school friend , Hugh Miller , celebrated as the Floating Manse . ( see Intrusion for more , and some pictures ) And I stood as a boy in the mighty cavern near Cape Wrath beside the pure-hearted pastor who , when ejected with his people from their church and manse on the ground of a site-refusing Duke , worshipped throughout the winter under those humid arches , while the only "" iife interests "" conceded him were in the savage rock and resounding shore . In the awakening of thought which such scenes stirred in the young , there was a strong moral element , not stimulating only , but animating . "" All good things have not kept aloof , nor wandered into other ways , "" was the irrepressible feeling of lads who had been drifting on towards the dull afternoon of the century , and were suddenly surrounded by this illuminating glow . Apparently then , their country , too , was to have a future as well as a past . For it was plain , oven in 1843 , that the great event of that year was essentially transitional . It left Scotland in a state of unstable equilibrium , and confronted it with a problem , political no doubt , but moral as well . And what might a history not call for in the future which revealed such gulfs and altitudes in the present ? What might such a country not yet claim of its sons ? Above all , what did it not already deserve at their hands ? Those of them who are most conscious of having failed in obedience to the early vision , do yet , in looking back , recognise the nobility of its call - a call which they have found most noble and most adequate precisely when they are brought nearest to some crisis of public duty . Those , on the other hand , who "" think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it , "" have never had a comfortable time in Scotland . The occasions for not merely admiring but imitating return too frequently . And for some time past there has been a well-founded apprehension in all parts of the Scottish Church that its complete freedom or its complete union may involve some of its members in a share - say , one-sixteenth or one - sixtieth part - of the same self-sacrifice as was shown in 1843 . That , of course , is not a plea that can be nakedly stated , nor is it one which many men in their hcarts entertain . The mass of the Scottish people , even when within the establishment , hold the principles which in that year drove their brethren out of it . And the only recent occasions , when illusory legislation in its favour has had even a passing chance of success , were when it was promised as "" on the lines of 1843 , "" or as "" all that was asked for "" in that year . But the contact of the unsatisfied claim of past history with the demand of present duty is far too suggestive to be safe ; and from time to time we hear , even in Scotland , unmeaning and gratuitous protests that the Disruption happened a long time ago - that it is now happily forgotten - and that , perhaps , to tell the truth , it never deserved to he remembered . As Free Churchmen born in the Scottish Highlands hear these recurrent clamours , we seem to see rising before us once more those grave suffering faces , most of them by this time gone down into a deeper silence ; and the utterance of their stillness is not nnlike that of our new Norse poet , - "" When thou hearest the fool rejoicing , and he saith , ' It is over and past , And the wrong was better tban right , and hate turns into love at the last And we strove for nothing at all , and the gods have fallen asleep , For so good the world is growing that the evil good shall reap , ' Then loosen thy sword in the scabbard , and settle the helm on thy head , For men betrayed are mighty , and great are the wrongfully dead . "" Bnt may the dead not have made a heroic mistake ? Was there , after all , any reason why they should sacrifice themselves and go out ? The answer must be given ; but readers who find constitutional facts too dry may pass over the next few pages . III In Scotland , which , as a whole , has been Presbyterian since the Reformation , the Church party has generally been the popular party . What is more strange to English ears , the Evangelical party has , on the whole , been the Church party , all revival here of religions feeling or individual conviction tending to take shape in public and organised action . Ten years before 1843 the General Assembly , or representative body of the ministers and laity of the Church , had begun to show an "" evangelical majority . "" It at once set about the work of Church reform , and especially of Church expansion , in two directions . The Church , by its own authority , welcomed to a seat in its courts the pastors of the two hundred new congregations , which had been gathered together chiefly through the devotion and eloquence of Dr. Chalmers . At the same time , and in the same way , it admitted a considerable number of Original Secession and other ministers who had returned to the reviving Establishment . Church Extension and Church Union , indeed , were supposed to be the great aggressive duties of the new time ; and the fact that ordinary Church administration has always been left in Scotland to the Church itself - the ordinary jurisdiction of its courts has never been intorfered with either before or after 1843 - naturally led to the belief that Church legislation and Church development might also be free . This was found to be a mistake , amid the refusal of places and votes to those who had been admitted by the Ecclesiastical body was in the long run the immediate cause of the Protest and Disruption of 1843 . But the third and earliest occasion of the quarrel with the State was the old question of patronage , which has broken out in so many lands , and which , under the name of Investiture , caused , in the eleventh century , the greatest conflict of Church and State which the world has seen . In Scotland , however , the veto upon arbitrary nomination by a patron was now declared to belong , not to pope , churchman , or chapter , but to the whole "" congregation of the faithful people . "" And this third measure was represented by the Assembly which passed it in 1834 , as a defensive rather than aggressive regulation - founded , indeed , on what was at all times a "" fundamental law of the Church . "" Suddenly , in the midst of so much expansive energy and enthusiasm , a crushing blow fell upon them . All three reforms were declared by the Law Courts to be incompetent ; but what was far more alarming was the ground on which in each case the conclusion was based . It was , that the Scottish Establishment is absolutely subject , even in matters ecclesiastical , to the State and to its enactments , past and future . The present constitutional law , that the Church of Scotland is in no sense independent of the State , but is absolutely subject to Parliament and to Statute , was then , for the first time , solemnly laid down . Take the three heads of the Court alone . President Hope put it thus : "" That our Saviour is the Head of the Kirk of Scotland in any temporal , or legislative , or judicial sense , is a position which I can signify by no other name than absurdity . The Parliament is the temporal head of the Church , from whose acts , and from whose acts alone , it exists as the National Church , and from which alone it derives all its powers . "" Again , "" Who gave the Church courts any jurisdiction ? The law and that alone gave it ; and the law defines what it has so given . "" And as the Church was not independent , they denied the possibility of any original compact , or of any real conflict , between Church and State , as an "" indecent supposition . "" Even the courts of the State were entitled to fix for the Church its separate province granted by the State . So President Boyle : "" There exists , in reality , no such thing as a conflict between the civil and ecclesiastical courts of a country , in which a church is established and endowed by the State . "" And so Lord Justice - Clerk Hope : "" I can not admit that an Establishment can ever possess an independent jurisdiction . "" And of course , on these principles , the courts made short work of the claim , that the Church was not bound to obey Acts of Parliament which proposed to regulate spiritual or Church actings . Several of the judges put it that the Church is "" the creature of Statute ; "" all of them that it is bound to obey Statutes which regulate , or , in its own view , interfere with , its proper church action . Take again only two of the utterances , and both from the chair of the court . In the third Auchterarder case , the Presbytery had pleaded that what they were called on to do was strictly ecclesiastical , was against their conscience , and against the commands of the Church . Lord Justice-Clerk Hope answered that although these functions are "" strictly ecclesiastical , and to be exercised by them in their ecclesiastical capacity , yet the obligation to perform them is statutory - Statute imposes the duty on the Church courts of the establishment , "" and the courts must enforce the statute . And when in the still higher sphere of the House of Lords it had been pleaded in addition , that there was a "" fundamental law "" of the Church of Scotland which forbade such Church action , even in compliance with statute , the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain , sitting as chief of the Jurisprudence of Scotland , enounced the general rule which has ever since been the law , as follows : "" Whether that is , or ever was , a law of the Church of Scotland , is perfectly immaterial , if the Statutes contain enactments and confer rights inconsistent with any such principle , or with the execution of any such law . "" ( Chalmers held otherwise , based on an Act of 1600 - ish , which he could quote , by which the Church of Scotland was specifically given certain defined rights . These points were never addressed by the Courts . - Webmaster ) It followed that the Church and its office-bearers were bound legally , and if they accepted the law would be bound legally and morally , to obey any statute the State might pass in the future , no matter how inconsistent it might be with the present or past principles of the Church - to obey it not merely passively , but actively , and as ecclesiastical functionaries . The obligation of individuals to obey actively received great prominence at an early stage of the decisions ; but before their close it was plain that on the principles now laid down the Church itself was in a worse case . For , in the event of its being thereafter dissatisfied with these or any worse incidents of its connection with the State , it would have no power either to abandon that connection , or to treat for new terms as a party able to accept or to refuse . This is the present law of establishment in Scotland , unchanged since 1843 ; and the principles I have quoted were laid down in great leading cases with cumulative emphasis and solemnity . But all of them were in themselves general statements of law , addressed to the constitutional question of Church independence , - a question which did not depend on the special matters of non-intrusion or Church extension , though they depended upon it . They were given as the ground , and they were the ground , of the innumerable decisions and orders of the court enforced against the Church . And they were intended to settle , and they did settle , what both parties knew and confessed to be the great constitutional question then in dependence . How opposed they are to the ancient theory held by the Church as to its independence I need not here say . But the law laid down long before May 1843 would have abundantly justified it even then in separating from the State , protesting that its constitutional liberties had been authoritatively subverted . Fortunately for the future of the country , it did otherwise . It appealed to the State itself , that is , to the Legislature and the Crown , against the decision of the judicial organs of the State . And it was only upon their neglect - and indeed rejection - of the Claim , Declaration , and Protest of 1842 , that the Free Church went out in 1843 . But when it did so , it combined the two considerations , of the authority of the Courts on the constitutional question , and the supereminent power of the Legislature , with great felicity , in its Protest , which ran "" Considering that the Legislature , by their rejection , etc. , ... have recognised and fixed the conditions of the Church Establishment , as hence-forward to subsist in Scotland , to be such as these have been pronounced and declared by the said Civil Courts , in their several recent decisions , in regard to matters spiritual and ecclesiastical . "" The one matter on which the Civil and Church Courts , otherwise so keenly opposed , were agreed , was this , that the claim of the Church was really one of independence - independence not merely of the Civil Courts , but of the State and Parliament . Therefore it became necessary for the Civil Courts , in enforcing their decrees against it , in matters ecclesiastical , to affirm its dependence upon both in the broad terms we have quoted . And therefore also the Church , in taking up its position in the Act of Assembly 1838 , affirming "" the independent jurisdiction , "" put it upon the ground that the "" power ecclesiastical flows immediately from God "" to the Church , and not through the mediation of the State or Parliament . But what probability was there that the Scottish Church could persuade the Legislature of Great Britain in 1842 , to affirm such an abstract proposition as this in regard to one of its Established Churches ? None whatever . Its only chance was that the Legislature might so far interfere as to prevent the enforcement of the orders and interdicts already based by the Court upon these general principles . In that case the Church could perhaps have honestly stayed in , as standing npon its own declaration of independence ; the denial of which by the Courts they would then have regarded as brutum fulmen , and no longer authoritative , because , at least virtually , disclaimed by the State . Even early in 1842 both parties were thus already agreed that the practical question must decide the constitutional question . Was the Church to obey , or was it not ? The Church made the most of its last hope in that massive and magnificent state-paper , the Claim , Declaration , and Protest of 1842 ; in which , while founding its jurisdiction not on law but on Gospel , and protesting that it was for maintaining the Headship of Christ and not of the State over the Church that it was called to sufifer , it laid at the same time great stress on the limited and civil jnrisdiction of the Court of Session , And while it enumerated here , as afterwards in its separating Protest , the long roll of cases in which the Court enforced the State's supremacy even in spiritualibus , - by which , "" no one function of the Church , "" "" and no one item mentioned by the laws as belonging peculiarly to its judgment , "" had been spared , - it passed over in silence the loud denials of Church independence upon which these encroachments were based . But what it did not omit was to affirm its own independence , and solemnly to "" declare "" to both Houses of Parliament and the Crown , that the Church could not in conscience obey or submit as the Court demanded , and that "" at the risk of losing the public advantages of an Establishment "" they "" must , as by God's grace they will , refuse to do so ; for , highly as they estimate these , they can not put them in competition with the inalienable liberties of a Church of Christ . "" The claim was rejected by the other great parties concerned with an equally fatal explicitness . Crown and Legislature declined to interfere ; and that not merely tacitly , which would have been abundantly enough . In the answer from the advisers of the Crown , ' and in the refusal of the House of Commons ' to entertain even a motion for enquiry , it was no doubt not concealed that they were zealous for the existence of Patronage , and knew the Church to be pledged against it . But in both of them the refusal was put explicitly upon the constitutional question stated by the Court , by the Assembly , and in the Claim of Rights , as the only one of chief importance ; and the legislative interference which all parties looked forward to was delayed in order , as the Prime Minister put it expressly in the House , that the pretensions of the Church to independence and co-ordinate jurisdiction might be first surrendered or crushed . I know not how a constitutional question such as the future relation of Church and State could be more solemnly and conclusively settled , than ( first ) by the authoritative and repeated utterances of the Supreme Courts , appealed against ( secondly ) by the National Church as fatal to its very existence , and ( lastly ) confirmed upon this appeal by the supreme power of the State as before all things necessary and right . And yet this was not all - not nearly all . It might have been a mere abstract question that was thus solemnly settled . But this abstract question was to be settled , as we have seen , - by the practical method of enforced obedience , and the constitutional disturbance attending it amounted to a long agony . Even before 1842 the Church and its Courts had solemnly protested that it could not obey the State in spiritualibus in the matters already enjoined it . And so during the eighteen months that followed , while it made its vain appeal to the Legislature , the mace of the law fell heavily and cruelly upon every part of the ecclesiastical body . In Perthshire , in Ayrshire , in Aberdeenshire , in every corner of the country , the principle of subjection to a civil statute in ecclesiastical matters was enforced by fines and interdicts , until the Church at last went out bruised in every quivering limb . But these sufferings - and even tbe fines and expenses which some of the houseless ministers had to pay , after being turned out of their livings - were not felt so much by the Church as the taunts which accompanied them . The Court of Session , in utterance as well as action , refused to tolerate even that interim refusal to obey while the Church was making its appeal to the Legislature . "" I wish , "" said Lord President Hope , speaking as the bead of the Court , "" to speak with all respect of the General Assembly , of which body I was for so long a period a member ; but if any other body of men , or if any individuals had done what they have done , I should feel constrained to designate their cpnduct as profligate . The Presbytery of Auchterarder came to this Court and pleaded here . Judgment went against them . The General Assembly sanctioned and directed an appeal to the House of Lords .... But the decision of the House of Lords affirmed the decision of this Court , and these same Church Courts absolutely refuse to give obedience to the judgment . To conduct like this I have already given its appropriate designation . In point of candour and fairness it is no better than the old shuffle , ' Odds I win , evens you lose . ' "" And this terrible imputatien of dishonesty , flung from the judgment-seat against those who should continue to eat the bread of the State , and yet refuse the legal conditions of establishment , was repeated more decorously again and again as the case went on . "" If these gentlemen , "" said President Hope in the second Auchterarder Case , "" wish to maintain the situation of what they call a Christian Church , they would be no better off than the Catholic Church , or the Episcopal Church , or the Burghers or Anti - Burghers ; but when they come to call themselves the Established Church , the Church of Scotland , what makes the Church of Scotland but the Law ? "" And the House of Lords was equally intolerant of men claiming to be free who remained in this law-made Church . "" It is fit , "" said Lord Brougham in the same case in the House of Lords , "" that these men at length learn the lesson of obedience to the tribunals which have been appointed over them ; a lesson which all others have long acquired , and which they , on learning it , should also practise . "" And this obedience , Lord Campbell went on immediately to explain , could not be evaded by those "" who continue members of the Establishment "" abandoning tbe temporalities to the State or the patron . Disestablishment was the only honest remedy . "" While the appellants remain members of the establishment , they are , in addition to their sacred character , public functionaries appointed and paid by the State , and they must perform the duties which the law of the land imposes on them . It is only a voluntary body , such as the Relief or Burgher Church in Scotland , self-founded and self-supported , that can say they will be entirely governed by their own rules . "" Now all these , whether we call them kindly suggestions or cruel taunts or statements of principle , came from the Supreme Courts as parts of their solemn judgments , and were authoritative . We need not therefore recall the far more violent attacks on the Church in the Legislature , the demand of the Moderate League , that the Government should choose which of the two parties was to remain in the Establishment , and the bitter inculpation of the Whig government by the Conservatives generally , and Lords Aberdeen and Brougham in particular , for its hesitation to enforce the new constitutional law . For the great strength of these hostile utterances during that last lingering year of the controversy , was that they were true - that the Church knew them to be true , and had made them part of its principles . The right of the State to fix its own conditions of establishment , whether those conditions be right or wrong , had been admitted in the most absolute way in the Church's Claim , Declaration , and Protest of 1842 , and is made the foundation of the Free Church Protest in 1843 . We , looking back , may be disposed to think that the denial of Church independence and the demand of subjection to Statute , affirmed by the Courts in and before 1842 , were final conditions of Establishment oven then , and that they might have come out before . But it is not for us harshly to judge Churchmen , who at the cost of uninterrupted taunts and insults , clung to the State till every method of appeal was exhausted - till , in fact ( as comes out so curiously in the Protest of 1843 ) , waiting in for a quarter of an hour longer had become practically and morally impossible . For thus it was that the constitutional question of subjection , now broadly separated from the previous one of patronage , and already decided by the Supreme Courts , was with due solemnity referred by the National Church to the Crown and Legislature , and was deliberately decided by the Legislature and the Crown . There are countries in which even this accumulation of reasons would not amount to reason f or revolution ; for in these lands the original independence of the Christian Church has faded out of the convictions of men . But in a country with such a history as Scotland , the Disruption was a necessity of conscience . It was not the less a memorable self-sacrifice . A quarter of an hour after it happened the news was brought to Lord Jeffrey as he sat in his room , and the old judge , springing from his seat , exclaimed , "" I am proud of my country ; there is not another upon earth where such a deed could have been done ! "" A quarter of a century after it happened Mr. Gladstone , speaking as Prime Minister in his place in Parliament , proclaimed that to the moral attitude of the new-born Church "" scarcely any word weaker or lower than that of majesty , is , according to the spirit of historical criticism , justly applicable . "" But the more that Scotland rocognises the deed of 1843 as flowing from her previous history and ancient convictions , the less will she be disposed to dwell upon it in any mood of transient exultation . Rather she will hear its voice at the close of the half-century as the same great Saga speaks it , - "" Wilt thou do the deed and repent it ? Thou had ' st better never been born . Wilt thou do the deed and exalt it ? Then thy praise shall be outworn . Thou shalt do the deed and abide it , and sit on thy throne on high , And look on to-day and to-morrow as those that never die ! "" ( William Morris' Sigurd the Volsung . ) III . But , in truth , the deed of 18th May , 1843 , is one which will never need to be repeated . What must in some form be repeated , and what may in many forms require to be imitated or improved upon - what , therefore , now deserves study not from Churchmen or Scotsmen alone - is the re-construction by which that deed was followed . For the reconstruction was the act of the people . "" Contrary to all anticipations , the people had forsaken the establishment in a much higher ratio as to numbers than the ministers ; and it would have required more than seven hundred churches to accommodate the congregations who were ready to attach themselves to the Free Church . "" Around us in the Highlands this side of the thing came out very strongly . Where the minister had resigned his living , the people followed him enthusiastically ; where he did not , they left him in a body . But in the Highlands , as much as in the Lowlands , an almost hopeless problem remained . In some places the people were numerous , but they were poor . In others they were a little better off , but they were few . But neither in the Highlands nor in the Lowlands had they been trained to act for themselves . It was a feudal country , and the natural leaders of the people - the chiefs in the north , like the lairds in the south - had in this matter failed them . Local self-government was not yet thought of . Voluntary parochial union had been evoked by Dr. Chalmers , and was one of the things now being crushed . But mere parochial union could not solve the problem how things were to be carried on upon a national scale , and for all time to come . In previous national efforts Scotsmen had the civil law of the nation behind thorn , obliging all citizens to religious union , and appropriating to the uses of the majority , in the name of their common country , the fruits and possessions of those who should refuse to obey . In the present ease that law was no longer at their back ; in so far as it survived , it worked now to enfeeble arid impoverish them . The experiment , whether a whole people could be banded together to work out by means of individual self-sacrifice one great common and permanent result , was to be tried under new conditions . And some of the conditions were not only new , but hard . For all over Scotland the congregations called to this problem were left houseless in one day . In one class of cases alone they earnestly attempted to save themselves . The Church Extension edifices had been raised chiefly , in some cases almost wholly , by the money of those who were now members of the Free Church , and the ministers officiating in them had been denied recognition by the Courts on the ground that they and their congregations were wholly a creation of the Church . But even these churches were now taken by the Courts from the Church which had erected them , and that on the paradoxical ground that they had been erected for the Church of the State . In south and north alike the congregations had thus to seek immediate shelter from the elements , as well as sites for more permanent homes of worship . But in south and north even sites for building were very often denied them . And this brought up , for the second time in this century , that inevitable Land Question which , in the previons generation , had been stirred in our Highlands by the bitterly remembered "" clearances . "" The amazing power which our law entrusts to private landholders , of excluding a whole community from purchasing a foot of ground in their own parish , or even their own county , came ont now for the first time in its intolerable extent . The clearances had sometimes swept out whole bodies or communities . "" I stood on the top of that hill when the evictions were going on , "" an old Sutherlandshire woman said to me , speaking of her youthful days , "" and I saw sixty cottages burning in the strath at one time . "" And I well remember the consternation in the Gaelic congregation to which in her age she belonged , when , one morning after 1843 , the announcement of an interdict drove them out from an ancient churchyard - a churchyard , too , distant half a mile from the parish church - amid whose moss-grown stones the people had met for many and many a sacrament before that mournful day . The preacher , who was that Sabbath to address four or five thousand Gaelic hearers , was Dr. John Macdonald of Ferintosh ; and he pointed ont , whother by way of defence or of aggravation , that the ground from which the people of the parish were so driven out was common and parochial property . The more usual case was that which happened , at almost the same time , to Dr. Thomas Guthrie of Edinburgh . In this case the Duke - Janet Fraser's Duke - was proprietor of the parish , and as landlord refused a site . The miserable people quietly withdrew to a waste spot of barren moor , and met there in the open air . The Duke's factor and agent instantly served an interdict on the trespassers , evicting them from even their open-air meeting on the waste . Henceforth they had no place on which to worship except the cross-roads on the public highway , and one Monday morning , after preaching to them there , Dr. Guthrie sat down to tell his experiences . "" Well wrapped up , I drove out yesterday morning to Canobie , the hills white with snow , the roads covered ankle deep in many places with slush , the wind high and cold , thick rain lashing on , and the Esk by our side all the way , roaring in the snowflood between bank and brae . We passed Johnnie Armstrong's Tower , yet strong even in its ruins , and after a drive of four miles , a turn of the road brought me in view of a scene which was overpowering , and would have brought the salt tears into the eyes of any man of common humanity . "" Dr. Guthrie's driver broke into sobs as he explained that the five hundred people waiting under some leafless trees on the turnpike road were the congregation who bad been refused first a site to build , and then a site to stand upon ; and who now waited on for hours under the driving rain till they had sung their last psalm on that fierce February day . It was not there only . So late as 1847 there were still thirty-one cases in Scotland in which sites were absolutely refused ; besides many others in which very inconvenient and humiliating places were deliberately offered - offered , toe , to tenants who frequently had the threat of eviction held over them if they ventured to build even upon these . Now what was the problem which the laymen of this Scottish Church , itself universally left houseless , had first of all to face ? It was not their own support , but that of their ministers and of many besides . The income of every Free Church minister ceased at Whitsunday , 1843 , and at the same date ceased his tenancy of the "" manse "" or parsonage , with its "" glebe "" of four acres of parochial ground . But along with them one hundred and thirty "" probationers , "" or preachers waiting for appointments , had , on the same day , thrown up all their prospects . The foreign missionaries sent out to India . , with Dr. Duff at their head , had likewise , without exception , sent in their adherence to the disendowed community . An old statute obliged all teachers , within or without the Universities , to be members of the Establishment , and the theological professors who , like Dr. Chalmers , had moved with the Church , were by this enactment obliged to resign their posts . A more cruel case remained . Every parish schoolmaster throughout Scotland who adhered to the Church going out was ejected from his small house , and deprived of his income . Ministers , missionaries , probationers , schoolmasters , and professors were in a day reduced to beggary . A small army of educated men , with their families , were left destitute and houseless , and thrown upon the congregations whose own necessities we have seen . In the days to come many hard questions will have to be dealt with in our own and other lands . The rights of labour , the claims of the poor , the division of the soil , the education of the young , the home-rule of our young empires , and the self-support of the Church - all these will bring round many a crisis in many a family of Western man . But can any of them ever present a harder problem than our fathers in Scotland had that day to solve ? Yet it was done - by Christian enthusiasm , no doubt . But that enthusiasm found or made fit channels for its flow . And among these we may mention first what is familiar in Scotland , but most strikes the observer outside . "" The Kirk , "" Sir Roundell Palmer told the House of Commons in 1869 , "" had her Kirk Sessions , her Presbyteries , her Synods , her General Assemblies , each step of self-government rising above the other , so that she had been well exercised in the whole art and power of self-government , self-legislation , and self-expansion , no State power coming in to prevent her Syneds from meeting . There the great men who afterwards became the leaders in the Free Church movement had as much liberty of speech as we have in this place . There they formed their parties ; there they organised their system ; there they collected together such a power and bond of moral public opinion as enabled them to go forth triumphantly , even when leaving all which in this world they possessed . "" It is a lesson for us all . For in Scotland , as elsewhere , there are now men who hate the whole system of Parliamentarism , in Church and State alike ; men who would rather shelter under any form of epicurean despotism than take their share of the risks and responsibilities of self-government . But that system has great tasks still to accomplish in the future , and there is no surer omen of its victory in these than that under it , in 1843 , the terrible crisis of Disestablishment was carried through . It was carried through , indeed , with scarcely any constitutional change . The Church remained the same , except as now founded on its Protest for freedom . The Presbyteries which had sat the week before as Courts of the Church of Scotland established , sat this week again - with frightful gaps and rents no doubt - but as Courts of the same Church unestablished . Legislation was held now , as before , to belong to its General Assembly , with consent of the Presbyteries ; for the refusal of the State to permit this , the Church had met by the last remedy . And none of these Church Courts are mere "" convocations of the clergy ; "" in all of them the representative layman , elected by the whole members of the congregation , decides upon the most sacred matters , with a vote equal to that of the Churchman at his side . And as with "" self government "" and "" self-legislation , "" so with the third function assigned to our classic hierarchy by Lord Selborne - "" self-expansion . "" Its rights of creating new congregations , recognising new ministers , and incorporating with itself other religious bodies - all repressed with fines and prohibitions only a few months before - were now exercised freely . It was all within the common law of Presbyterianism - a code of authoritative principles , whose breadth , forgotten so long as our branch of the system flowed in a merely national and statutory channel , was soon to be restored to the view of all in the ecumenical assemblies or Councils of the communion . But the feature in the new organisation of most interest , not so much in the past as for the future of our own and other lands , was what Dr. Chalmers , with his usual passion for sonorous phraseology , called a Sustentation Fund . ' It was , in truth , a new and great experiment in altruism or Christian solidarity . The local enthusiasm which had everywhere arisen of course received fit embodiment . Long before the Disruption Dr. Chalmers had given forth as his watchword , "" Organise , organise , organise ! "" And while in response congregational associations were everywhere instituted , and great numbers of women collectors gathered weekly the contributions of the faithful , the old order of deacons was revived for what was supposed to have been in apostolic times their exclusive function - the receiving and administering of the monies of the local church . But through all these organisations there passed the breath of one new life , when , in autumn 1842 , it was proposed that they should no longer retain their own contributions for their separate benefit , hut should send the mass of them on to one central fund for the Church as a whole , to be again divided equally from that centre among all the ministers . The idea was almost new then , but in that time of common suffering it commended itself irresistibly ; and it has ever since been acted on to an extraordinary extent . Some Free Church congregations send to the Sustentation Fund annually from £ 1,000 to £ 3,000 ; others in poorer districts can only send from £ 10 to £ 50 . But the small and the large contribution go alike into the common purse , and , as the time of annual division comes round , the minister of the poorer congregation receives from it the same amount as the minister of the greater - no less , and no more . This national voluntaryism , as Dr. Chalmers pointed out , really becomes an establishment of the Church from its own resources , and while it "" coincides in principle "" with that former method of support , it is free from some of its obvious disadvantages . In particular , it leaves to the Church itself the more complicated adjustment of the remaining question , how the salary from this equal dividend may be locally added to . For , as Dr. Chalmers originally urged , mere equality would not be justice where one minister with city burdens was giving up a stipend of £ 1,000 a year , and another in the country lost only £ 200 . Besides , it is not even desirable that the minister of a congregation , however he may be protected by the Central Fund from the possibility of being starved out , should be removed from the stimulus which most other workers have in the prospect of a larger income for successful work . How all this was met by the institution of congregational supplements , - a variable accretion of local voluntaryism , added on to the solid nucleus of the Church's own establishment in the Sustentation Fund ; - and how the two combined have , through many years of not yet ended experiment , become a backbone to the Free Church ( a back bone whose value seems to be owing nearly equally to its firmness and its flexibility ) , we need not here inquire . ' What is important to notice is , that the idea which it embodies , which men have new come to speak of as a kind of national altruism , pressed outwards at the same time in many other directions , and beyond all merely patriotic bounds . We have seen the houselessness of the congregations in every county throughout the hard north . But a hundred thousand pounds were subscribed for building even before the Disruption day dawned , and within the first year five hundred churches were erected . Then came the effort necessary to provide manses or pastorages for the ministers . And then it was recollected that the evicted schoolmasters and their children were homeless too . Yet all this concerned no city Scotsman who doubted whether he were his brother's keeper , and who reflected that the raising of such edifices implied a certain obligation in all time coming to those for whom they were built . Almost the only enterprise indeed , in which the centres were not able to sacrifice themselves for those outside , was the raising of the three colleges - two of them soon permanently endowed by private munificence , and the third now , with all its imperfections , the most fully equipped theological institute in theological Scotland . But the impulse was one which , in its own nature , could not be restricted to self-regarding or self-conserving effort . All the missionaries had joined the Church in its conflict , and , as might be expected , all now fulfilled their pledge . But the disestablished Church , instead of recalling them , commenced to double , and more than double , the sum previously sent out to maintain them . Missions to spread Christianity among the Jews followed , and missions to fan the flame of evangelism in Catholic countries . New missions to colonies , where Scotsmen so abound , could scarcely be called outside enterprises ; and these bring us back to the special funds instituted for the Highlands and Islands , and to the new and great enterprise of a Home Mission , partly consisting of Extension Charges throughout the country , and partly of Territorial Charges , "" excavated , "" to use Dr. Chalmers' word , in our great towns . For instead of gradually abandoning the stations whose support was forced upon it in 1843 by the necessities of its local adherents , the pastoral charges of the Free Church have by this time nearly doubled . In view of the openings which the future is certain to bring to other communities , not necessarily in similar forms , nor , indeed , in religious relations at all , the study of some of these various channels and moulds as they were filled at once by one glowing enthusiasm , will always be important . But for my purposes , and with a view to the suggestion that in the future the Free Church too may hopefully hear itself called to a renewal of self-sacrifice , and that not in one form but in many , it is well to pause upon the results of the half-century . Three years before its close the Christian givings of this fragment of a poor country , stripped in one day to the very bone , had already amounted to more than twenty millions . Yet during the first half of the half-century they reached only about eight millions . From time to time the figures have varied , as represented by the following , which gives the amount for the opening year of each of its decades 1843 .... £ 363,871 1853 .... £ 289,670 1863 .... £ 343,626 1873 .... £ 511,084 1883 .... £ 628,222 The leap to the higher platform , which is here so visible at one point , happened , strange to say , just about the time when the last of the old Disruption leaders was taken away , and the glory of the separate communion they formed might seem to have departed . But , in truth , it happened in accordance with all the deeper instincts of history - at the very time when that communion announced a resolve to sacrifice its long-prized separation , to refuse the bribe of re-establishment , and to claim henceforward part in the whole burdens of our country's future . And the result was in no respect strange . For the future of a country is to its Church "" such a burden as wings are to a bird . "" The Free Church and its Sustentation Fund embody ideas important for Presbyterianism , and even for Congregationalism , in America and our Colonies and many a distant hand . But their first duty is to their own country . And it seems to me that the time has at last come when the finance and other schemes of the Church of 1843 may frankly assume the aspect of provisional and experimental scaffolding - scaffolding in whose construction those now without should be consulted or considered as much as those within , because the Building which already rises behind it is one in which all Scottish Presbyterians have a right to dwell .

54	"11 IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS His visit to M. de Treville being paid , the pensive d ' Artagnan took the longest way homeward . On what was d ' Artagnan thinking , that he strayed thus from his path , gazing at the stars of heaven , and sometimes sighing , sometimes smiling ? He was thinking of Mme . Bonacieux . For an apprentice Musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love . Pretty , mysterious , initiated in almost all the secrets of the court , which reflected such a charming gravity over her pleasing features , it might be surmised that she was not wholly unmoved ; and this is an irresistible charm to novices in love . Moreover , d ' Artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her ; and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character . D ' Artagnan already fancied himself , so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination , accosted by a messenger from the young woman , who brought him some billet appointing a meeting , a gold chain , or a diamond . We have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame . Let us add that in these times of lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses ; and that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable remembrances , as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts . Without a blush , men made their way in the world by the means of women blushing . Such as were only beautiful gave their beauty , whence , without doubt , comes the proverb , "" The most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has . "" Such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money ; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place , nor their battles afterward , without the purse , more or less furnished , which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow . D ' Artagnan owned nothing . Provincial diffidence , that slight varnish , the ephemeral flower , that down of the peach , had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three Musketeers gave their friend . D ' Artagnan , following the strange custom of the times , considered himself at Paris as on a campaign , neither more nor less than if he had been in Flanders--Spain yonder , woman here . In each there was an enemy to contend with , and contributions to be levied . But , we must say , at the present moment d ' Artagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested . The mercer had said that he was rich ; the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as M. Bonacieux ; and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love , which had been the consequence of it . We say ALMOST , for the idea that a young , handsome , kind , and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love , but on the contrary strengthens it . There are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty . A fine and white stocking , a silken robe , a lace kerchief , a pretty slipper on the foot , a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty , but they make a pretty woman beautiful , without reckoning the hands , which gain by all this ; the hands , among women particularly , to be beautiful must be idle . Then d ' Artagnan , as the reader , from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune , very well knows--d ' Artagnan was not a millionaire ; he hoped to become one someday , but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant . In the meanwhile , how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a woman's happiness , and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings . At least , when the woman is rich and the lover is not , that which he can not offer she offers to herself ; and although it is generally with her husband's money that she procures herself this indulgence , the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him . Then d ' Artagnan , disposed to become the most tender of lovers , was at the same time a very devoted friend , In the midst of his amorous projects for the mercer's wife , he did not forget his friends . The pretty Mme . Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain St. Denis or in the fair of St. Germain , in company with Athos , Porthos , and Aramis , to whom d ' Artagnan had often remarked this . Then one could enjoy charming little dinners , where one touches on one side the hand of a friend , and on the other the foot of a mistress . Besides , on pressing occasions , in extreme difficulties , d ' Artagnan would become the preserver of his friends . And M. Bonacieux ? whom d ' Artagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers , denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him . We are compelled to admit to our readers that d ' Artagnan thought nothing about him in any way ; or that if he did think of him , it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was , wherever it might be . Love is the most selfish of all the passions . Let our readers reassure themselves . IF d ' Artagnan forgets his host , or appears to forget him , under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried , we will not forget him , and we know where he is . But for the moment , let us do as did the amorous Gascon ; we will see after the worthy mercer later . D ' Artagnan , reflecting on his future amours , addressing himself to the beautiful night , and smiling at the stars , ascended the Rue Cherish-Midi , or Chase-Midi , as it was then called . As he found himself in the quarter in which Aramis lived , he took it into his head to pay his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to send Planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the mousetrap . Now , if Aramis had been at home when Planchet came to his abode , he had doubtless hastened to the Rue des Fossoyeurs , and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps , they would not be able to conceive what all this meant . This mystery required an explanation ; at least , so d ' Artagnan declared to himself . He likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty little Mme . Bonacieux , of whom his head , if not his heart , was already full . We must never look for discretion in first love . First love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow , it will stifle you . Paris for two hours past had been dark , and seemed a desert . Eleven o ' clock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg St. Germain . It was delightful weather . D ' Artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the Rue d ' Assas is now situated , breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the Rue de Vaugirard , and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night . From a distance resounded , deadened , however , by good shutters , the songs of the tipplers , enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain . Arrived at the end of the lane , d ' Artagnan turned to the left . The house in which Aramis dwelt was situated between the Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandoni . D ' Artagnan had just passed the Rue Cassette , and already perceived the door of his friend's house , shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it , when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the Rue Servandoni . This something was enveloped in a cloak , and d ' Artagnan at first believed it was a man ; but by the smallness of the form , the hesitation of the walk , and the indecision of the step , he soon discovered that it was a woman . Further , this woman , as if not certain of the house she was seeking , lifted up her eyes to look around her , stopped , went backward , and then returned again . D ' Artagnan was perplexed . "" Shall I go and offer her my services ? "" thought he . "" By her step she must be young ; perhaps she is pretty . Oh , yes ! But a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover . If I should disturb a rendezvous , that would not be the best means of commencing an acquaintance . "" Meantime the young woman continued to advance , counting the houses and windows . This was neither long nor difficult . There were but three hotels in this part of the street ; and only two windows looking toward the road , one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis occupied , the other belonging to Aramis himself . "" PARIDIEU ! "" said d ' Artagnan to himself , to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted , "" PARDIEU , it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend's house . But on my soul , it looks so . Ah , my dear Aramis , this time I shall find you out . "" And d ' Artagnan , making himself as small as he could , concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche . The young woman continued to advance ; and in addition to the lightness of her step , which had betrayed her , she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice . D ' Artagnan believed this cough to be a signal . Nevertheless , whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker , or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey , she resolutely drew near to Aramis's shutter , and tapped , at three equal intervals , with her bent finger . "" This is all very fine , dear Aramis , "" murmured d ' Artagnan . "" Ah , Monsieur Hypocrite , I understand how you study theology . "" The three blows were scarcely struck , when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter . "" Ah , ah ! "" said the listener , "" not through doors , but through windows ! Ah , this visit was expected . We shall see the windows open , and the lady enter by escalade . Very pretty ! "" But to the great astonishment of d ' Artagnan , the shutter remained closed . Still more , the light which had shone for an instant disappeared , and all was again in obscurity . D ' Artagnan thought this could not last long , and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears . He was right ; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside . The young woman in the street replied by a single tap , and the shutter was opened a little way . It may be judged whether d ' Artagnan looked or listened with avidity . Unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber ; but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night . Besides , the eyes of the Gascons have , as it is asserted , like those of cats , the faculty of seeing in the dark . D ' Artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object , which she unfolded quickly , and which took the form of a handkerchief . She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object . This immediately recalled to d ' Artagnan's mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of Mme . Bonacieux , which had reminded him of that which he had dragged from under the feet of Aramis . "" What the devil could that handkerchief signify ? "" Placed where he was , d ' Artagnan could not perceive the face of Aramis . We say Aramis , because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior . Curiosity prevailed over prudence ; and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene , he stole from his hiding place , and quick as lightning , but stepping with utmost caution , he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall , from which his eye could pierce the interior of Aramis's room . Upon gaining this advantage d ' Artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise ; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor , it was a woman ! D ' Artagnan , however , could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments , not enough to distinguish her features . At the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket , and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her . Then some words were spoken by the two women . At length the shutter closed . The woman who was outside the window turned round , and passed within four steps of d ' Artagnan , pulling down the hood of her mantle ; but the precaution was too late , d ' Artagnan had already recognized Mme . Bonacieux . Mme . Bonacieux ! The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of d ' Artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket ; but what probability was there that Mme . Bonacieux , who had sent for M. Laporte in order to be reconducted to the Louvre , should be running about the streets of Paris at half past eleven at night , at the risk of being abducted a second time ? This must be , then , an affair of importance ; and what is the most important affair to a woman of twenty-five ! Love . But was it on her own account , or on account of another , that she exposed herself to such hazards ? This was a question the young man asked himself , whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed , being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted lover . There was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither Mme . Bonacieux was going ; that was to follow her . This method was so simple that d ' Artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively . But at the sight of the young man , who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche , and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her , Mme . Bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled . D ' Artagnan ran after her . It was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her cloak . He came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street . The unfortunate woman was exhausted , not by fatigue , but by terror , and when d ' Artagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder , she sank upon one knee , crying in a choking voice , "" Kill me , if you please , you shall know nothing ! "" D ' Artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist ; but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting , he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness . These protestations were nothing for Mme . Bonacieux , for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world ; but the voice was all . Mme . Bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice ; she reopened her eyes , cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so , and at once perceiving it was d ' Artagnan , she uttered a cry of joy , "" Oh , it is you , it is you ! Thank God , thank God ! "" "" Yes , it is I , "" said d ' Artagnan , "" it is I , whom God has sent to watch over you . "" "" Was it with that intention you followed me ? "" asked the young woman , with a coquettish smile , whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence , and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy . "" No , "" said d ' Artagnan ; "" no , I confess it . It was chance that threw me in your way ; I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends . "" "" One of your friends ? "" interrupted Mme . Bonacieux . "" Without doubt ; Aramis is one of my best friends . "" "" Aramis ! Who is he ? "" "" Come , come , you wo n ' t tell me you do n't know Aramis ? "" "" This is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced . "" "" It is the first time , then , that you ever went to that house ? "" "" Undoubtedly . "" "" And you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man ? "" "" No. "" "" By a Musketeer ? "" "" No , indeed ! "" "" It was not he , then , you came to seek ? "" "" Not the least in the world . Besides , you must have seen that the person to whom I spoke was a woman . "" "" That is true ; but this woman is a friend of Aramis -- "" "" I know nothing of that . "" "" -- since she lodges with him . "" "" That does not concern me . "" "" But who is she ? "" "" Oh , that is not my secret . "" "" My dear Madame Bonacieux , you are charming ; but at the same time you are one of the most mysterious women . "" "" Do I lose by that ? "" "" No ; you are , on the contrary , adorable . "" "" Give me your arm , then . "" "" Most willingly . And now ? "" "" Now escort me . "" "" Where ? "" "" Where I am going . "" "" But where are you going ? "" "" You will see , because you will leave me at the door . "" "" Shall I wait for you ? "" "" That will be useless . "" "" You will return alone , then ? "" "" Perhaps yes , perhaps no . "" "" But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman ? "" "" I do n't know yet . "" "" But I will know it ! "" "" How so ? "" "" I will wait until you come out . "" "" In that case , adieu . "" "" Why so ? "" "" I do not want you . "" "" But you have claimed -- "" "" The aid of a gentleman , not the watchfulness of a spy . "" "" The word is rather hard . "" "" How are they called who follow others in spite of them ? "" "" They are indiscreet . "" "" The word is too mild . "" "" Well , madame , I perceive I must do as you wish . "" "" Why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once ? "" "" Is there no merit in repentance ? "" "" And do you really repent ? "" "" I know nothing about it myself . But what I know is that I promise to do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are going . "" "" And you will leave me then ? "" "" Yes . "" "" Without waiting for my coming out again ? "" "" Yes . "" "" Word of honor ? "" "" By the faith of a gentleman . Take my arm , and let us go . "" D ' Artagnan offered his arm to Mme . Bonacieux , who willingly took it , half laughing , half trembling , and both gained the top of Rue de la Harpe . Arriving there , the young woman seemed to hesitate , as she had before done in the Rue Vaugirard . She seemed , however , by certain signs , to recognize a door , and approaching that door , "" And now , monsieur , "" said she , "" it is here I have business ; a thousand thanks for your honorable company , which has saved me from all the dangers to which , alone I was exposed . But the moment is come to keep your word ; I have reached my destination . "" "" And you will have nothing to fear on your return ? "" "" I shall have nothing to fear but robbers . "" "" And that is nothing ? "" "" What could they take from me ? I have not a penny about me . "" "" You forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms . "" "" Which ? "" "" That which I found at your feet , and replaced in your pocket . "" "" Hold your tongue , imprudent man ! Do you wish to destroy me ? "" "" You see very plainly that there is still danger for you , since a single word makes you tremble ; and you confess that if that word were heard you would be ruined . Come , come , madame ! "" cried d ' Artagnan , seizing her hands , and surveying her with an ardent glance , "" come , be more generous . Confide in me . Have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart ? "" "" Yes , "" replied Mme . Bonacieux ; "" therefore , ask my own secrets , and I will reveal them to you ; but those of others--that is quite another thing . "" "" Very well , "" said d ' Artagnan , "" I shall discover them ; as these secrets may have an influence over your life , these secrets must become mine . "" "" Beware of what you do ! "" cried the young woman , in a manner so serious as to make d ' Artagnan start in spite of himself . "" Oh , meddle in nothing which concerns me . Do not seek to assist me in that which I am accomplishing . This I ask of you in the name of the interest with which I inspire you , in the name of the service you have rendered me and which I never shall forget while I have life . Rather , place faith in what I tell you . Have no more concern about me ; I exist no longer for you , any more than if you had never seen me . "" "" Must Aramis do as much as I , madame ? "" said d ' Artagnan , deeply piqued . "" This is the second or third time , monsieur , that you have repeated that name , and yet I have told you that I do not know him . "" "" You do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked ? Indeed , madame , you believe me too credulous ! "" "" Confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this personage . "" "" I invent nothing , madame ; I create nothing . I only speak that exact truth . "" "" And you say that one of your friends lives in that house ? "" "" I say so , and I repeat it for the third time ; that house is one inhabited by my friend , and that friend is Aramis . "" "" All this will be cleared up at a later period , "" murmured the young woman ; "" no , monsieur , be silent . "" "" If you could see my heart , "" said d ' Artagnan , "" you would there read so much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would instantly satisfy my curiosity . We have nothing to fear from those who love us . "" "" You speak very suddenly of love , monsieur , "" said the young woman , shaking her head . "" That is because love has come suddenly upon me , and for the first time ; and because I am only twenty . "" The young woman looked at him furtively . "" Listen ; I am already upon the scent , "" resumed d ' Artagnan . "" About three months ago I was near having a duel with Aramis concerning a handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his house--for a handkerchief marked in the same manner , I am sure . "" "" Monsieur , "" said the young woman , "" you weary me very much , I assure you , with your questions . "" "" But you , madame , prudent as you are , think , if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief , and that handkerchief were to be seized , would you not be compromised ? "" "" In what way ? The initials are only mine -- C. B. , Constance Bonacieux . "" "" Or Camille de Bois-Tracy . "" "" Silence , monsieur ! Once again , silence ! Ah , since the dangers I incur on my own account can not stop you , think of those you may yourself run ! "" "" Me ? "" "" Yes ; there is peril of imprisonment , risk of life in knowing me . "" "" Then I will not leave you . "" "" Monsieur ! "" said the young woman , supplicating him and clasping her hands together , "" monsieur , in the name of heaven , by the honor of a soldier , by the courtesy of a gentleman , depart ! There , there midnight sounds ! That is the hour when I am expected . "" "" Madame , "" said the young man , bowing ; "" I can refuse nothing asked of me thus . Be content ; I will depart . "" "" But you will not follow me ; you will not watch me ? "" "" I will return home instantly . "" "" Ah , I was quite sure you were a good and brave young man , "" said Mme . Bonacieux , holding out her hand to him , and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall . D ' Artagnan seized the hand held out to him , and kissed it ardently . "" Ah ! I wish I had never seen you ! "" cried d ' Artagnan , with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness , because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason . "" Well ! "" resumed Mme . Bonacieux , in a voice almost caressing , and pressing the hand of d ' Artagnan , who had not relinquished hers , "" well : I will not say as much as you do ; what is lost for today may not be lost forever . Who knows , when I shall be at liberty , that I may not satisfy your curiosity ? "" "" And will you make the same promise to my love ? "" cried d ' Artagnan , beside himself with joy . "" Oh , as to that , I do not engage myself . That depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire me . "" "" Then today , madame -- "" "" Oh , today , I am no further than gratitude . "" "" Ah ! You are too charming , "" said d ' Artagnan , sorrowfully ; "" and you abuse my love . "" "" No , I use your generosity , that 's all . But be of good cheer ; with certain people , everything comes round . "" "" Oh , you render me the happiest of men ! Do not forget this evening--do not forget that promise . "" "" Be satisfied . In the proper time and place I will remember everything . Now then , go , go , in the name of heaven ! I was expected at sharp midnight , and I am late . "" "" By five minutes . "" "" Yes ; but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages . "" "" When one loves . "" "" Well ! And who told you I had no affair with a lover ? "" "" It is a man , then , who expects you ? "" cried d ' Artagnan . "" A man ! "" "" The discussion is going to begin again ! "" said Mme . Bonacieux , with a half-smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience . "" No , no ; I go , I depart ! I believe in you , and I would have all the merit of my devotion , even if that devotion were stupidity . Adieu , madame , adieu ! "" And as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held , he sprang away , running , while Mme . Bonacieux knocked , as at the shutter , three light and regular taps . When he had gained the angle of the street , he turned . The door had been opened , and shut again ; the mercer's pretty wife had disappeared . D ' Artagnan pursued his way . He had given his word not to watch Mme . Bonacieux , and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her , d ' Artagnan would have returned home , since he had so promised . Five minutes later he was in the Rue des Fossoyeurs . "" Poor Athos ! "" said he ; "" he will never guess what all this means . He will have fallen asleep waiting for me , or else he will have returned home , where he will have learned that a woman had been there . A woman with Athos ! After all , "" continued d ' Artagnan , "" there was certainly one with Aramis . All this is very strange ; and I am curious to know how it will end . "" "" Badly , monsieur , badly ! "" replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of Planchet ; for , soliloquizing aloud , as very preoccupied people do , he had entered the alley , at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber . "" How badly ? What do you mean by that , you idiot ? "" asked d ' Artagnan . "" What has happened ? "" "" All sorts of misfortunes . "" "" What ? "" "" In the first place , Monsieur Athos is arrested . "" "" Arrested ! Athos arrested ! What for ? "" "" He was found in your lodging ; they took him for you . "" "" And by whom was he arrested ? "" "" By Guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight . "" "" Why did he not tell them his name ? Why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair ? "" "" He took care not to do so , monsieur ; on the contrary , he came up to me and said , ' It is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and not I , since he knows everything and I know nothing . They will believe he is arrested , and that will give him time ; in three days I will tell them who I am , and they can not fail to let me go . ' "" "" Bravo , Athos ! Noble heart ! "" murmured d ' Artagnan . "" I know him well there ! And what did the officers do ? "" "" Four conveyed him away , I do n't know where--to the Bastille or Fort l ' Eveque . Two remained with the men in black , who rummaged every place and took all the papers . The last two mounted guard at the door during this examination ; then , when all was over , they went away , leaving the house empty and exposed . "" "" And Porthos and Aramis ? "" "" I could not find them ; they did not come . "" "" But they may come any moment , for you left word that I awaited them ? "" "" Yes , monsieur . "" "" Well , do n't budge , then ; if they come , tell them what has happened . Let them wait for me at the Pomme-de-Pin . Here it would be dangerous ; the house may be watched . I will run to Monsieur de Treville to tell them all this , and will meet them there . "" "" Very well , monsieur , "" said Planchet . "" But you will remain ; you are not afraid ? "" said d ' Artagnan , coming back to recommend courage to his lackey . "" Be easy , monsieur , "" said Planchet ; "" you do not know me yet . I am brave when I set about it . It is all in beginning . Besides , I am a Picard . "" "" Then it is understood , "" said d ' Artagnan ; "" you would rather be killed than desert your post ? "" "" Yes , monsieur ; and there is nothing I would not do to prove to Monsieur that I am attached to him . "" "" Good ! "" said d ' Artagnan to himself . "" It appears that the method I have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best . I shall use it again upon occasion . "" And with all the swiftness of his legs , already a little fatigued however , with the perambulations of the day , d ' Artagnan directed his course toward M. de Treville's . M. de Treville was not at his hotel . His company was on guard at the Louvre ; he was at the Louvre with his company . It was necessary to reach M. de Treville ; it was important that he should be informed of what was passing . D ' Artagnan resolved to try and enter the Louvre . His costume of Guardsman in the company of M. Dessessart ought to be his passport . He therefore went down the Rue des Petits Augustins , and came up to the quay , in order to take the New Bridge . He had at first an idea of crossing by the ferry ; but on gaining the riverside , he had mechanically put his hand into his pocket , and perceived that he had not wherewithal to pay his passage . As he gained the top of the Rue Guenegaud , he saw two persons coming out of the Rue Dauphine whose appearance very much struck him . Of the two persons who composed this group , one was a man and the other a woman . The woman had the outline of Mme . Bonacieux ; the man resembled Aramis so much as to be mistaken for him . Besides , the woman wore that black mantle which d ' Artagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door of the Rue de la Harpe ; still further , the man wore the uniform of a Musketeer . The woman's hood was pulled down , and the man held a handkerchief to his face . Both , as this double precaution indicated , had an interest in not being recognized . They took the bridge . That was d ' Artagnan's road , as he was going to the Louvre . D ' Artagnan followed them . He had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really Mme . Bonacieux and that the man was Aramis . He felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his heart . He felt himself doubly betrayed , by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a mistress . Mme . Bonacieux had declared to him , by all the gods , that she did not know Aramis ; and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion , he found her hanging on the arm of Aramis . D ' Artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer's pretty wife for three hours ; that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black , who wished to carry her off , and that she had promised him nothing . He considered himself an outraged , betrayed , and ridiculed lover . Blood and anger mounted to his face ; he was resolved to unravel the mystery . The young man and young woman perceived they were watched , and redoubled their speed . D ' Artagnan determined upon his course . He passed them , then returned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine . Which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the bridge . D ' Artagnan stopped before them , and they stopped before him . "" What do you want , monsieur ? "" demanded the Musketeer , recoiling a step , and with a foreign accent , which proved to d ' Artagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures . "" It is not Aramis ! "" cried he . "" No , monsieur , it is not Aramis ; and by your exclamation I perceive you have mistaken me for another , and pardon you . "" "" You pardon me ? "" cried d ' Artagnan . "" Yes , "" replied the stranger . "" Allow me , then , to pass on , since it is not with me you have anything to do . "" "" You are right , monsieur , it is not with you that I have anything to do ; it is with Madame . "" "" With Madame ! You do not know her , "" replied the stranger . "" You are deceived , monsieur ; I know her very well . "" "" Ah , "" said Mme . Bonacieux ; in a tone of reproach , "" ah , monsieur , I had your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman . I hoped to be able to rely upon that . "" "" And I , madame ! "" said d ' Artagnan , embarrassed ; "" you promised me -- "" "" Take my arm , madame , "" said the stranger , "" and let us continue our way . "" D ' Artagnan , however , stupefied , cast down , annihilated by all that happened , stood , with crossed arms , before the Musketeer and Mme . Bonacieux . The Musketeer advanced two steps , and pushed d ' Artagnan aside with his hand . D ' Artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword . At the same time , and with the rapidity of lightning , the stranger drew his . "" In the name of heaven , my Lord ! "" cried Mme . Bonacieux , throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands . "" My Lord ! "" cried d ' Artagnan , enlightened by a sudden idea , "" my Lord ! Pardon me , monsieur , but you are not -- "" "" My Lord the Duke of Buckingham , "" said Mme . Bonacieux , in an undertone ; "" and now you may ruin us all . "" "" My Lord , Madame , I ask a hundred pardons ! But I love her , my Lord , and was jealous . You know what it is to love , my Lord . Pardon me , and then tell me how I can risk my life to serve your Grace ? "" "" You are a brave young man , "" said Buckingham , holding out his hand to d ' Artagnan , who pressed it respectfully . "" You offer me your services ; with the same frankness I accept them . Follow us at a distance of twenty paces , as far as the Louvre , and if anyone watches us , slay him ! "" D ' Artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm , allowed the duke and Mme . Bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead , and then followed them , ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of Charles I. Fortunately , he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion , and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any interference . As for d ' Artagnan , he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the Pomme-de-Pin , where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting him . Without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them , he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance . Meanwhile , carried away as we are by our narrative , we must leave our three friends to themselves , and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the Louvre ."	6
243	"Fifty-eighth session Agenda item 9 Note verbale dated 28 March 2002 from the Permanent Mission of Armenia to the United Nations Office at Geneva addressed to the secretariat of the Commission on Human Rights The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Armenia to the United Nations Office and other international organizations at Geneva presents its compliments to the secretariat of the Commission on Human Rights and has the honour to request that the attached * information be circulated as an official document of the fifty-eighth session of the Commission under agenda item 9 , "" Question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world "" . * The annex is reproduced as received in the language of submission and in English only . Annex More than 14 years have passed since Sumgait . Sufficient time for a full appraisal of the gravity of this tragic event for the Armenian people . The events of Sumgait were a natural consequence of the atmosphere of total lawlessness , in which the Azerbaijani leaders spurred on the zealots in the country and incited them to further Sumgait-like atrocities . Whipped up into a state of nationalist histeria , the deceived masses perpetrated vicious crimes , burning people alive , demonstrating how easily entire multitudes could be reft of any semblance of humanity and many hundreds of people transformed into bloodthirsty sadists . Yet what is possibly still more monstrous than these barbarous acts is the way that the fine upstanding citizens entrusted with the reins of power in the republic and in the country did everything they could to conceal the truth about Sumgait and to shelter the culprits from justice . The impunity enjoyed by the instigators and organizers of the Sumgait pogrom is proof that the State itself took them under its wing . The way that events subsequently developed in Azerbaijan graphically demonstrated that the Sumgait approach to the settlement of ethnic scores was to be the chosen method . As early as May 1988 , on the initiative of the Shusha district Party committee , the process of deporting Armenians from Shusha was commenced . In September , the bloody events took place in the village of Khojaly and the last Armenians were driven out of Shusha . In November pogroms were being waged throughout Azerbaijan . Yet there was no response - neither political , nor legal - to any of these actions . An atmosphere of total impunity prevailed , in which there were repeated incitements to the perpetration of further Sumgait-like massacres . For its part , the Azerbaijani leadership only gave encouragement to those who showed the greatest zeal . The Sumgait events were organized with a view to hushing up and concealing the Nagorny Karabakh problem . A wave of anti-Armenian demonstrations swept across all Azerbaijan in February 1988 , but it was decided to deal the most decisive blow against the Armenians of Sumgait - as the most defenceless . Thugs were bussed into Sumgait from other regions and local officials drew up lists of all Armenians . Members of the country's top brass - the first secretary of the Central Committee and the chairman of the Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan - also made their way to Sumgait . Every possible preparation was made : even supplies of cobblestones were brought into the city . The only thing which the organizers of the Sumgait events had not reckoned with was that there might be honest and courageous people among the Azerbaijanis themselves who would refuse to succumb to the hysteria being whipped up . Had it not been for them , the city's entire Armenian population would have been mercilessly slaughtered . Sumgait was destined to transform the problem of Nagorny Karabakh and the will of its people - an essentially democratic issue - into one of the world's implacable ethnic conflicts . Sumgait represented the focal point of the genocidal policies conducted by the Azerbaijani leaders against Armenians , one inevitable result of which was the "" cleansing "" of the Nakhichevan region and other historically Armenian territories of their Armenian populations . In the course of three days in February 1988 , virtually the entire territory of this city , with its population of a quarter of a million , became the arena for wide-scale , unrestrained pogroms against the Armenian population . Dozens were killed , a significant number of whom had been burned alive , after being beaten and tortured . Hundreds were wounded , many of them left disabled for life . Women and young girls were raped . More than 200 homes were wrecked and looted , scores of motor cars were set alight or smashed up , and dozens of workshops , shops , kiosks and other social facilities were smashed and plundered . Thousands of people became refugees . And yet is this the only measure of the tragedy - how many people were killed in this city or how many homes were wrecked and looted ? Immeasurable moral losses were suffered not only by the victims of the tragedy , but also by the people in whose name these atrocities were committed . "" After the barbarities of Stalinism "" , wrote Moscow academics in their "" Open letter to friends in Armenia "" , "" no single event has occurred in our country that has dragged us further back from civilization to savagery "" . Sumgait turned two neighbouring peoples - Armenians and Azerbaijanis - into unconcealed and irreconcilable enemies and had exceptionally severe consequences for their subsequent relations with one another . Sumgait demonstrated for the first time that , in a multi-ethnic State which upheld friendship among peoples as one of its most hallowed principles , people could be killed quite simply because they belonged to the wrong nationality . The first Sumgait "" rally "" was not particularly well supported but the second , organized the following day , 27 February , was attended by thousands of people , many of whom had been sent out on to the city square on the orders of their managers and supervisors . Among the rallying calls , uttered not only by the instigators , but also by such prominent citizens of Sumgait as the headmaster of secondary school No. 25 and a well-known actress from the Arablinksy Theatre , were references to Armenian "" atrocities "" and the "" martyrs "" of Kafan , the Karabakh issue , and the need to punish the Armenians , to kill them and to drive them from Sumgait and from Azerbaijan in general . The constant refrain of many harangues and the most often repeated slogan of those days was "" Death to Armenians ! "" . Besides words , other means of agitation were also used , such as vodka and drugs , dispensed directly from lorries to members of the crowd in great quantities and free of charge . In the evening of 27 February , the "" rallies "" had degenerated into wide-scale violence . The first beatings and pogroms continued late into the night and then , the following day , hundreds of people who had been directly involved in the perpetration of these crimes assembled for their next "" rally "" , just as if nothing untoward had happened . This is an extremely important point : the participants in the pogrom were thereby given definitive assurances of their impunity . The culmination of the "" rally "" on 28 February was reached when Muslim-zade , first secretary of the Sumgait city Party committee , took up the State flag of the Azerbaijani SSR and led the huge crowd which had gathered behind him on to Lenin Square . Thereupon the crowd scattered and , already equipped with weapons , launched their attacks against the homes of Armenians ... The bloody tragedy which unfolded in Sumgait encompassed every imaginable human crime and suffering . We can not but be astounded by the scale and impunity of the pogrom and the cynicism and brutality with which it was conducted . The crimes of those days seem quite inconceivable when we consider that the gangs perpetrating them were made up not of professional murderers and sadists , but of ordinary citizens , predominantly young people . For an explanation , we must look back in history and consider certain ideological and psychological realities . The massacre of Armenians in the city of Baku in 1918 , the massacre in Shusha in 1920 , the methodical expulsion , which ultimately achieved a 100 per cent success , of the indigenous Armenians from the Nakhichevan Autonomous SSR , countless crimes of an ethnic nature , the constant , virtually undisguised discrimination against the Armenian population throughout the Republic of Azerbaijan , the defiling of monuments to Armenian history and architecture , the hatred of Armenians instilled in children from their earliest years - all this must be taken into consideration if we are to understand how a student from a technical college or a factory worker who , prior to this , never did anything particularly reprehensible , entirely normal people with their own interests , family-oriented people , should suddenly prove capable of responding on the spur of the moment to incitations to kill their fellow citizens entirely innocent of any crime , to commit murders , and to perpetrate these acts with a pathological brutality that appalled even the forensic experts . And yet , however monstrous their offences , it is not they who are the prime culprits but those who were able so subtly and adroitly to transform them into monsters . Since no condemnation was expressed and no punishment handed down for the crimes committed at Sumgait , they were followed by dozens of lesser and greater pogroms of the Armenian population of the Azerbaijani SSR , including in the capital city , Baku , where more Armenian blood was spilled . And with the passing of time , even in Sumgait , where no Armenians remained , persecutions were mounted against those who had saved Armenians during the days of that February hell , while at rallies in Baku the butchers of Sumgait were hailed as nothing less than national heroes . The consequences of connivance are plain for all to see . "" Sumgait became a spur for new tragedies and bloodshed "" , wrote the academics in their "" Open letter to friends in Armenia "" . "" While the blood of Sumgait might be on the hands of those who organized and carried out this bacchanal , responsibility for what followed rests with all those who failed to respond to the scale of the tragedy , who failed to understand and to this day fail to understand that no one , be he or she Lithuanian or Jew , Bashkir or Russian , that no people and no single person can feel safe while the crimes of murderers are allowed to go unpunished "" . The organizers and the perpetrators of the Sumgait atrocities must be punished . The peoples of the world must know the truth about the cruelty and barbarity of the Azerbaijani authorities and the criminals responsible for this monstrous crime ."	0
1108	"In certain sports , such as football , field hockey , ice hockey , handball , rugby union , lacrosse and rugby league , winger is a position . It refers to positions on the extreme left and right sides of the pitch ( the "" wings "" ) . In American football and Canadian football , the analogous position is the wide receiver . Wingers often try to use pace to exploit extra space available on the flanks that can be made available by their team-mates dominating the centre ground . They must be wary however of not crossing the touchline and going out of play . In sports where the main method of scoring involves attacking a small goal ( by whatever name ) in the centre of the field , a common tactic is to cross the ball to a central team-mate . Contents In football , a winger is an attacking midfielder in a wide position . Wingers are usually players of great pace or dribbling ability so as to provide cut-backs or crosses from which strikers can score . Their main function is to support attack from the wings . Wingers do lots of high-speed running from defence to attack . In Australian rules football , the wingers or wingmen require considerable pace and stamina , as they run up and down the ground linking play between defence and attack and are normally highly skilled in kicking . "" Winger "" , in ice hockey , is a forward position of a player whose primary zone of play on the ice is along the outer playing area . They typically work by flanking the centre forward . Originally the name was given to forward players who went up and down the sides of the rink . Nowadays , there are different types of wing men in the game – out-and-out goal scorers , checkers who disrupt the opponents and forwards who work along the boards and in the corners . This position is typically just called "" Wing "" , often preceded by the side on which the player normally skates ( Left Wing or Right Wing ) . In Handball are two wing positions : left wing and right wing . In a typical team , these positions are occupied by fast and relatively small players . One of their main jobs in a game are fast attacks . Wingers or wings play on either the extreme left or the extreme right . They are usually the fastest players on the field and score the most tries . Wingers often fall back with the fullback to take kicks from the opposition ."	4
1309	My own go-to resource , when faced with a matter that requires a political frame in which to examine how best to synthesize a way forward where paths appear to divide , is Socrates . ( If you know all matters of library management are political , then you can probably manage – not knowing this already , however , is no preclusion to your blossoming as a leader – albeit , a leader who best learn that all library management matters do , indeed , have a vein of politics threaded through . Thus the big [ ger ] bucks ) . Socrates , unlike a manager , did not direct , supervise or set performance standards . Socrates asked questions , and not just random questions but questions that demand reflection , imagination and a willingness to experience some level of personal ambiguity or discomfort on the part of the person who works to find the best response to each such question . The nonmanager leader in the library needs to learn how to frame such questions . The best questions a leader poses bring the management forward ; they do n't push a personal agenda , coerce , or belittle management as it is . The best questions focus management attention on how to synthesize the leader's new , perhaps strange ( to the nonleader ) vision with political reality . And what do managers who are fairly certain that their forte is administrative rather than visionary have to offer such leaders to forestall their disaffection with outgrowing the library that needs their guiding light ? Cetainly the top of the possible heap of responses to that one is a willingness for ambiguity and mild intellectual discomfort ( conditions from which no one dies and unfortunately too many recover with no after effects ) . Managers and leaders rarely stumble unconsciously into a healthy symbiotic relationship . It takes conscious – and conscientious – work on the parts of both to synthesize how to manage and move a library forward .	0
1482	"Fee or commission – what 's the best business model ? According to research by Cerulli , it appears that the answer is "" both . "" The AUM of so-called "" hybrid "" advisors who can earn both fees and commissions grew 19.1 % in 2012 , while pure RIAs grew 14.7 % . While the argument has raged in the DC market over the last decade , with some pundits declaring the commission-based model dead , the best answer seems to be that advisors should be flexible enough to be able to serve clients and sell products based on their needs , not on the desired business model . Especially popular among plan advisors , the hybrid model allows them to collect trails from commissioned products they might have sold in the past even if they currently sell fee-based only ; some advisors keep their broker dealer affiliation for variable annuities . Converting commission-based plans to fee-based can take time , and not all providers are willing and able . Aggregators trying to attract new advisors prefer the hybrid model , since many advisors look to own their RIA apart from their broker dealer – especially advisors moving from the independent BD model ."	0

382	"' Fight poverty not wars ' : reflections from the Edinburgh march Jim Jepps reports from the scorching streets of Edinburgh I 've been told that Madonna began her set with her hit ' Music ' whose main refrain goes "" Music unites the rebel with the bourgeoisie . "" I can think of hardly any other song that sums up Live8 better than this . But if the ideas of the gig goers and TV viewers must have been mixed , what of those who actually came to the protests in Edinburgh ? Having spent the weekend diligently vox popping and discussing the mood there are some clear pictures emerging , of who is here and why . There are of course three main ' camps ' . The NGO / Make Poverty History crowd who range from ' let's hope Gordon makes some good decisions ' to a fairly clear , if fluffy , anti-capitalist consciousness . The opposite camp is the dissent / indymedia crew with their formidable logistical acumen and clear intent to both protest and have fun at the same time . These two camps have no cross over what-so-ever as far as I can see . Sitting cheerfully in the middle is the G8 Alternatives / socialist / radical grouping . This middle group certainly has the advantage of wanting to talk and discuss with the more Christian / NGO elements of the demonstrations , but I ca n ' t help feel it 's often in a very sterile and unimaginative way . Having taken a random sample of paper sellers its pretty clear the left found the new ' white bloc ' impenetrable and often were irritated by a perceived blandness . A few self deluded souls aside it was clear that the old style revolutionary literature was not ' selling like hot cakes ' - part of the question is , is this because the demonstrators were to the right of the anti-war demonstrators or because parts of the left is putting their message across in a tired and stale way that leaves one hungry for less ? The Edinburgh demo itself was scorching hot and enormous . Clearly something between two and three hundred thousand strong . Whilst many went on the march others found queuing for hours in the park just to get on the march less appealing and ' the Meadows ' was thronging all day with those listening to the music on big screens , having fun with various family friendly activities or simply catching up with old friends . Great fan of route marching for justice though I am I thought I 'd do my duty and quiz those remaining in the Meadows on how they thought things were going . There was certainly a real carnival atmosphere and part of the reason for this has been the incredible diversity of the hundreds of thousands of participants . I do n't just mean the obvious political differences , but the cultural breadth of it as well . I think this demo had far more young people on it than even the great two million demo against the war that seems like many years ago - and it 's clear there were a high proportion of families and groups of friends there . Another obvious difference between the mass anti-war demonstration and today is that Saturday's demo was very very white - and I 'm not referring to their shirts . I think part of this is the product of NGO and church involvement that have brought people on mass from the middle of England and also the apparent non-involvement of the Muslim community that made the anti-war movement so inspiring . A few placards ( chosen at random ) "" send my friend to school "" , "" George Bush number one terrorist "" , "" no man is an island "" , "" left to die by G8 con "" , "" dirty aid , dirty water "" and the clear and simple "" fight poverty , not wars . "" It was also nice to see Daily Mirror placards - with their headers torn off . Speaking to people about the relationship between the mass gigs and the demo I got some interesting responses . Dave from Oxford thought that in the media the gigs will have surpassed the demo and that the music was guaranteed press coverage in a way that the G8 ' Alternatives ' were not . However , as a veteran of Prague , Nice and Genoa anti-capitalist protests he still felt that it was the direct action that was the most important part of the anti-G8 protests . However important this mass involvement was ( and he clearly thought it was ) this was not an anti-capitalist mobilisation , but a demo for a "" nicer world "" with anti-capitalists in it , as a radical rump . We chatted about whether this G8 was more like previous mobilisations Genoa or Birmingham . It feels like the size and emotion was at the level of Genoa but the predominant ideas were often that of the NGO dominated Birmingham mobilisation . Matthew from Leeds thought this underplayed the diversity of the Genoa protests , because although they were explicitly anti-capitalist there were still pacifist , white handed , Christians there , who ironically took some of the worst of the beatings from the police . Martin from London pointed out the lack of trade union banners , but , in all fairness , as I wondered the crowd I later came across a gorgeous block of trade union banners and placards and the sectioning off was more of a sign of rigid and determined organisation of a very large demonstration than lack of union support . I hunted out some paper sellers of various left organisations who were , on the whole , fairly candid and said that whilst they 'd sold lots of merchandise they were having difficulty selling their papers . One seller saying "" the Christians are impenetrable . "" This was clearly not a traditional hard left protest . Speaking to Karen and Lindsey from Zimbabwe they asked "" where are the African voices here ? "" and felt that Africa probably did n't even know about the G8 and their protests were taking place . But they also seemed to reflect some of the tabloid worries about African corruption and felt that any benefits the G8 should bestow had to be tied to advances of democracy against dictatorship . I really pressed them on this because it seemed unrealistic to me to say unless you 're nicer to your people we will let them starve . But they were pretty clear , no debt relief et al without attacking corruption . Later in the day George Monbiot ( star of the Stop the War rally in my view ) addressed this point really well when he said that "" It 's the Western multinationals that are the biggest bribe givers in the world - who are they to lecture anyone on corruption ? "" There was another clear worry on the part of the protesters - that of being used by the G8 and the demonstration being seen to be owned by Brown , Geldof and co. Jo from Inverness went so far as to say that she should have been marching separately to make it clear she wanted to abolish the G8 , not simply appeal for it to have a cuddly side . Nan , Jo's vociferous yet jovial friend , said that although "" folk sometimes need a spokesman "" they "" forget we have all have a mind "" and even people who are seen to be leading the movement need to listen and respect the opinions of this broad mass . This point was also picked up on at the Stop the War rally when John Rees quite rightly proclaimed that we should never let anyone "" use a mass movement for their own purposes "" and I could n ' t agree more with John on this ( cough ) . David and Lorna , from ' the north ' ( of England ) put it well when I asked if they 'd come to demonstrate for or against the G8 . "" We think the G8 should just get off the backs of the poor . That 's what we think , but I 'm not sure everyone here agrees . "" It was also clear they were pulled by two different arguments . Whilst on the one hand they felt that many of the NGO style protests seem politically bland and they were very keen to say that it 's the corporations that are one of the prime creators of injustice in the poorest parts of the world . They were frustrated that the mainstream acceptance of the campaign had also diluted the message far too far - simultaneously they believed that Geldof had made "" this all possible "" . Now in terms of numbers I actually believe it 's the descendents of Jubilee 2000 that mobilised the bulk of demonstrators on Saturday but it 's certainly true that Geldof has helped create what Monbiot described as "" the false consensus "" that we are all on the same side . That 's why brilliant African activist Trevor Ngwane had his invitation to speak at the Make Poverty History rally withdrawn because his message of opposition to privatisation and neo-liberalism was "" too radical "" . But if we 're not going to address the conditions of structural adjustment that further impoverish the impoverished and create massive human catastrophes then are n ' t we just saying "" let 's throw a few coppers in the charity bowl to make ourselves feel better rather because it 's too radical to actually make a difference . "" John , from Edinburgh Unison was also very clear . It 's true that the voices of Africa had been virtually ignored in the debate on what should happen there but it 's also true that the people of the West have to take responsibility and do what they can to make the world a better place - "" we ca n ' t simply leave the fight up to them [ Africans ] , because the same problems of workers' rights and privatisation come from here "" and although we ca n ' t end the problems ( unlike the implication of the Live8 memento stalls labelled "" the final push "" we have to try . The separation of the radical and mainstream elements of the demonstrations also led to a split in the way the more radical participants reacted to the whole affair . Some began to see themselves as the ' real ' protesters accompanied by far more politically backward elements - others developed a kind of frantic self delusional style trying to convince themselves that the entire thing was in support of their own views of the world . I found both these solutions wholly unattractive , although thankfully not everyone feel into these polarised camps . The Stop the War rally on Saturday saw a whole string of shrieking speakers barking at the rather small crowd ( estimates between 500 and 2,000 ) which felt very small because of the size of the earlier demo . Speaker after speaker referred to how ' we ' had made this all possible ( which ' we ' they did n't say ) and the how the war was central to it all , or who poured hatred and scorn upon Make Poverty History for its insipid message of collaboration with the enemy . The fantastic antidote to this was George Monbiot who not only had something to say of interest but actually spoke to the crowd rather than shouting at them . And , incidentally , on the question of the war , there were a large number of "" George Bush World's # 1 terrorist "" placards both on Saturday and on the Sunday anti-war demo which I ca n ' t help feeling is the wrong message for the left to send out . I liked the occasional "" fight poverty not wars "" placards that I saw which genuinely drew the issues together , but to tell tens of thousands of people who want to do something about global injustice that actually the only real issue is the war on terror I fear is to try to pull people away from making those connections and saying something that we hear every day , even in the mainstream press . Just a little niggle really . Anyway , having tried to record fairly faithfully a flavour of the conversations I had with the actual participants on the demo as an antidote to the rewriting of history that will inevitably take place , I 'll give the last word to Diane and David , the two demonstrators standing right at the back . "" The whole idea is to end poverty , but these are all interlinked issues , we 've not got much faith in the G8 but I just hope that they 've watching and listening . """	0
1125	"Man Booker Prize shortlist 2016 : Hot Milk by Deborah Levy is a dream-like narrative tease – review F rom Beautiful Mutants ( 1989 ) , a nightmarish satire of Thatcher's London , to The Unloved ( 1994 ) , a murder mystery with a gruelling flashback to the Algerian war of independence , Deborah Levy's early novels unfolded as fragmentary , perplexing torrents of images , populated by sexual deviants and damp with the blood of 20th-century conflicts , anti-naturalist but not reducible to allegory . In the 2000s she published no novels ; Levy was raising two children . But the market for fiction had changed by the time of her 2011 comeback , Swimming Home . That novel , which turned on an illicit encounter between a poet and his young fan at a French holiday villa , was less opaque than Levy's previous work . However , the mainstream publishing houses deemed it too literary ; it was left to the independent outfit And Other Stories , whereupon it was shortlisted for the 2012 Man Booker Prize . Ironically , thanks to that success , Levy has once again been embraced by an imprint of Penguin Random House . Hot Milk , her latest novel , is concerned with hypochondria and a troubled mother-daughter relationship . At the level of the sentence , at least , it is her most straightforwardly readable book : you can be confident of knowing what 's happening in a way that was n't the case in her earlier work , which was written in defiance of "" the slow , dulling imitation of real life "" . But while she meets the reader halfway , an elusive quality remains . The narrator is Sofia , a half-Greek anthropology graduate in her mid-20s who has given up a doctorate to care for her English mother Rose , whose paralysis has baffled various British doctors . Now Rose has remortgaged her Hackney home and Sofia has abandoned her below-minimum-wage job as a barista to spend a month together in arid Andalusia at a private physiotherapy clinic . Adrift , Sofia compares her dormant doctoral thesis to "" an unclaimed suicide "" . She does n't speak Greek and has n't seen her father for 11 years , but keeps his surname ; tellingly , Sofia says the "" Papa - "" prefix is the only part of her name anyone can pronounce . Both mother and daughter spend a lot of time observing each other without seeing . While Sofia has had to be attentive to Rose's complaints from a young age , we sense that she has n't taken into account the sacrifices her mother made in raising her alone . On the beach , Sofia is drawn to Ingrid from Berlin , whom she initially mistakes for a man after a lavatory cubicle mix-up . The shifting dynamics of this affair ( complicated by Ingrid's American boyfriend and her regular assignations with a riding instructor ) are the most propulsive element in the multi-layered , dream-like narrative . Eurozone austerity ( figured in unfinished apartment blocks and unemployment ) anchors the action in the real world . Events float by in short snatches , interspersed with creepy paragraphs from the point of view of someone who is spying on "" the Greek girl "" . At first we think the voice belongs to a philosophy graduate who helps Sofia with a jellyfish sting . Later – more troublingly - we think it might belong to someone she has never met . Whoever it is , they note that , at bedtime , Sofia does n't lock the door of the apartment she shares with Rose : "" an invitation to hurt her very badly "" . These interludes are among several narrative teases ; "" Whatever you are waiting for may not arrive , "" Sofia says at one point . While Rose calls her daughter "" plump and idle and ... living off her mother at quite an advanced age "" , Sofia , by her own account , is "" anti the major plots "" : she does n't want to be someone's girlfriend and rejects any prospect of motherhood : "" I was flesh thirst desire dust blood lips cracking feet blistered knees skinned hips bruised , but I was so happy not to be napping on a sofa under a blanket with ... a baby on my lap . "" There 's an ironic twist to make any hypochondriac shudder , as well as a disturbing late revelation about childhood innocence . But ultimately Hot Milk , like most of Levy's fiction , is about its uncanny atmosphere . Ingrid takes an axe to a snake on her bathroom floor after a post-coital cold shower with Sofia ; she gives Sofia a halterneck top embroidered with the word "" beloved "" , only for Sofia to see that it actually reads "" beheaded "" . Once , Sofia deposits Rose's wheelchair in front of an oncoming lorry . These bizarre images imprint themselves long after the end of this feverish coming-of-age novel , which confirms the resurgence of its singular author . PP 217 , Hamish Hamilton , £ 12 . 99 .

1	"China and a New Balance of Power SHANGHAI – The last rival superpower to the United States , the Soviet Union , collapsed in 1991 . But , apart from its military strength , the USSR was never really powerful enough to counterbalance US influence . In the late 1980's , Japan seemed capable of challenging America's industrial leadership , but by the 1990's it lost its competitive edge . China might itself wish to be a major force in a multi-polar world , but has been plagued by its lack of overall strength . Given these realities , China sees the expanding European Union as a likely counterweight to unchecked US power . In terms of economic output , today's EU is on par with the US . But it has yet to build a strong defense system that can respond effectively either to regional contingencies or to global needs . What would be the strength of such a system if and when it is developed , and how will it compare with that of the US ? In assessing America's strength , China follows US debates on the merits of a uni-polar or a multi-polar world with keen interest . Some Americans favor a uni-polar system in which the US dominates . Such a Pax Americana would cost the country less to sustain , but the world would worry if America adopts a wrong policy , as has been the case in Iraq . The US certainly has a right to curb terrorists like those who staged the attack on September 11 , 2001 . But the "" war on terror "" did not warrant the decision to attack a sovereign state and topple its government on the flawed presumption that it housed weapons of mass destruction and was linked to the 2001 attacks . The US went to war despite strong opposition from France , Germany , Russia , China , and other United Nations Security Council members . France and Germany have since sought to restore good relations with the US , but continue to disapprove of the war . The Middle East , always a region of concern for Europe , has become even less stable as a result of the war . American leadership has been one of the war's casualties . In China , the concept of an independent European defense – embodied in the European Security and Defense Policy ( ESDP ) , as well as the EU's Rapid Reaction Force ( RRF ) and various police missions – is thus generally seen as necessary and effective in a multi-polar world system . China observes that on most security matters , the ESDP will ( for now ) mimic American security interests , because the EU and US share fundamental values of human rights and democracy . Moreover , many EU members have simultaneously pledged their defense capabilities to NATO , which has been led by the US since its creation . But the ESDP , once fully developed , will not necessarily follow America's lead unconditionally , especially if American policy continues to deviate from the norm of international law , as in Iraq . As a result of acquiring a pan-European defense capacity , the Europeans are likely to play a more independent role than at present in managing intra-European security relations and carrying out global missions . China welcomes this expanded security role for the EU . Although it remains wary of international intervention by the EU , the substance and pattern of ESDP operations are likely to win China's respect for several reasons . First , China's leaders note that the ESDP gives priority to the legitimacy of its missions . So far , all ESDP missions have respected international law and governmental arrangements among disputing parties . Most of its military or police missions have been based on UN Security Council resolutions , and ESDP missions outside Europe have been at the invitation of local authorities . Of course , ESDP security missions , even those in accordance with Security Council resolutions , may not operate within the UN system – the EU prefers its own independent leadership . The ESDP does not necessarily require Security Council authorization as a condition for its missions , and it retains an independent role in executing them . However , when compared with the US , the ESDP ( in Chinese eyes ) cares far more about international legitimacy , backed by the authority of the UN . Second , the ESDP is concerned with good governance and institution building . The EU is keen to restore or establish human rights , stability , and prosperity . Outside Europe , the ESDP acts to enhance governance rather than promote regime change , and the EU has often assisted governments' efforts to improve security conditions . Third , the ESDP is open to international cooperation . The EU works with either non-EU states , such as NATO members like Canada , Norway , and Turkey , or applicants for EU membership . The ESDP cooperates with the UN and other regional organizations , such as the African Union and ASEAN . When the EU reaches out , it tends to play a leading role in these collaborations . There are good reasons to expect that China will continue to accept an independent European security mechanism . There is little concern , if any , about the ESDP intervening in internal Chinese affairs , such as Taiwan . Indeed , China wants a strong and independent Europe , and from that vantage point it is not too early for China to envisage a truly multi-polar global system ."	0

Because they have rejected the law of the LORD and have not kept his decrees , because they have been led astray by false gods , [ b ] the gods [ c ] their ancestors followed , 5 I will send fire upon Judah that will consume the fortresses of Jerusalem .

In the house of their god they drink wine taken as fines . 9 "" I destroyed the Amorite before them , though he was tall as the cedars and strong as the oaks . I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below . 10 "" I brought you up out of Egypt , and I led you forty years in the desert to give you the land of the Amorites . 11 I also raised up prophets from among your sons and Nazirites from among your young men .

1388	Can I Test Drive a Car ? Buying a car is a big decision for any motorist , so they should explore all of the different ways of deciding whether a car is right for them and their family . It is important for a motorist to explore a car's features , capabilities and drive experience , which can be difficult to do effectively if confined to a show-room or shopping online , which may be unsafe to shop online for a car . Many dealerships or private individuals may offer a test-drive , and there is usually no harm in asking . When considering different cars for purchase , a motorist should telephone the different dealerships to see if a test-drive can be arranged . In addition , some online car dealerships can also offer test-drives which can be booked online . Motorists should remember that if the purchase a car they will have to live with it , so they are advised not to base the purchase too heavily on the car's superficial characteristics . In addition , the customer should remember that the salesperson will always be looking for a sale , and should receive their information with this in mind . The Driving Experience When taking a test-drive , it is a good idea to have researched the model heavily so that the motorist can see if the car's driving experience lives up to the manufacturer's claims . The test-drive should be booked in for a time when the customer is not under pressure , meaning that they can fully concentrate on the driving experience . This is also useful to give he customer plenty of time to fully test the car's features . For example , it is a good idea to test the car within a variety of situations , such as motorways or suburban travel . This is can enable the driver to get a measure of the car's versatility and the extent to which it ill fit their usage , such as heavy motorway travel for someone who commutes . It is , however , important for the customer to run their planned route by the salesperson before deviating from the regular test-drive route . The motorist may also be concerned by the quality of the car's interior , which can sometimes be forgotten if they are concentrating on the road . One should explore its functionality , such as adjustable seats , leg-room , how easy the skylight is to operate etc. . The customer should not be afraid to try everything to determine how durable and user-friendly it is . For this task it is often useful to bring a passenger for the ride . Passengers can take in extra details which the driver may miss , and can account for the quality of the car's ride while sitting it the back . If the motorist is comparing different vehicles , it is important for them to give themselves the best chance of finding the best one . This can be achieved by test driving the cars in as quick a succession as possible , to compare the features most closely . If one can arrange to test more than one car in a day , this will provide a very effective comparison . If the motorist feels that the need another driver to further test the car's specification , dealerships will usually be pleased to facilitate this as they feel that they may be close to a sale . Overall , buying a new car carries a lot of responsibility , such as car insurance comparisons . Very little can be gained by rushing this process , so the motorist should use every opportunity to test the car's quality and capabilities . The driver , if they require some more information , should remember that their dealership usually be pleased to facilitate a second test-drive , as they imagine it will get them closer to a sale , there can never be any harm in telephoning to ask .	7

1509	"Tips for living with coyotes Thu July 25 , 2013 10 : 29pm Coyotes are part of the natural habitat in California , and they are increasingly adept at searching for food in cities because their natural habitat has increasingly been encroached by development . Coyote conflicts with humans are extremely rare , even though coyote activity is higher during this time of year as this is the season when they are raising their pups . If you walk your dog in or near any of the known coyote habitats , keep your dog on a leash at all times as required by municipal codes . If possible , avoid walking dogs in the early morning or at dusk , which are prime feeding times for coyotes . Keep small pets indoors , especially cats - they are an easy favored prey Coyotes and other predators may be attracted to areas that provide protective cover . Remove hiding spaces by keeping brush and weeds from around buildings cleared . Many coyotes have lost their natural fear of humans . The best thing that you can do if you see a coyote is to "" haze "" them . This involves standing tall and making yourself look big while waving your arms ; yelling at them to go away ; throwing objects toward them ; or spraying them with water . It is essential that coyotes retain their natural fear of humans . Never run from a coyote . Keep constant eye contact with the coyote and continue to move toward other people , a building or an area of activity . In the event of a life-threatening emergency please call 911 . LBACS advises residents to report coyote attacks , threats and aggressive behavior at 562-570-7387 . If coyotes are sighted in areas where there are children ( schools , parks , etc. ) or if the coyotes are acting aggressively , an officer will be dispatched immediately . Additionally , LBACS takes reports of coyote activities and forwards any threats to pets or people to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife so that they may respond appropriately .

37	"Mark 1 John the Baptist Prepares the Way 1 The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ , the Son of God . [ a ] 2 It is written in Isaiah the prophet : "" I will send my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare your way "" [ b ] – 3 "" a voice of one calling in the desert , ' Prepare the way for the Lord , make straight paths for him . ' "" [ c ] 4 And so John came , baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins . 5 The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him . Confessing their sins , they were baptized by him in the Jordan River . 6 John wore clothing made of camel's hair , with a leather belt around his waist , and he ate locusts and wild honey . 7 And this was his message : "" After me will come one more powerful than I , the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie . 8 I baptize you with [ d ] water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . "" The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus 9 At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan . 10 As Jesus was coming up out of the water , he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove . 11 And a voice came from heaven : "" You are my Son , whom I love ; with you I am well pleased . "" 12 At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert , 13 and he was in the desert forty days , being tempted by Satan . He was with the wild animals , and angels attended him . The Calling of the First Disciples 14 After John was put in prison , Jesus went into Galilee , proclaiming the good news of God . 15 "" The time has come , "" he said . "" The kingdom of God is near . Repent and believe the good news ! "" 16 As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake , for they were fishermen . 17 "" Come , follow me , "" Jesus said , "" and I will make you fishers of men . "" 18 At once they left their nets and followed him . 19 When he had gone a little farther , he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat , preparing their nets . 20 Without delay he called them , and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him . Jesus Drives Out an Evil Spirit 21 They went to Capernaum , and when the Sabbath came , Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach . 22 The people were amazed at his teaching , because he taught them as one who had authority , not as the teachers of the law . 23 Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil [ e ] spirit cried out , 24 "" What do you want with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are – the Holy One of God ! "" 25 "" Be quiet ! "" said Jesus sternly . "" Come out of him ! "" 26 The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek . 27 The people were all so amazed that they asked each other , "" What is this ? A new teaching – and with authority ! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him . "" 28 News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee . Jesus Heals Many 29 As soon as they left the synagogue , they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew . 30 Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever , and they told Jesus about her . 31 So he went to her , took her hand and helped her up . The fever left her and she began to wait on them . 32 That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed . 33 The whole town gathered at the door , 34 and Jesus healed many who had various diseases . He also drove out many demons , but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was . Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place 35 Very early in the morning , while it was still dark , Jesus got up , left the house and went off to a solitary place , where he prayed . 36 Simon and his companions went to look for him , 37 and when they found him , they exclaimed : "" Everyone is looking for you ! "" 38 Jesus replied , "" Let us go somewhere else – to the nearby villages – so I can preach there also . That is why I have come . "" 39 So he traveled throughout Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons . A Man With Leprosy 40 A man with leprosy [ f ] came to him and begged him on his knees , "" If you are willing , you can make me clean . "" 41 Filled with compassion , Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man . "" I am willing , "" he said . "" Be clean ! "" 42 Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured . 43 Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning : 44 "" See that you do n't tell this to anyone . But go , show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing , as a testimony to them . "" 45 Instead he went out and began to talk freely , spreading the news . As a result , Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places . Yet the people still came to him from everywhere . Mark 2 Jesus Heals a Paralytic 1 A few days later , when Jesus again entered Capernaum , the people heard that he had come home . 2 So many gathered that there was no room left , not even outside the door , and he preached the word to them . 3 Some men came , bringing to him a paralytic , carried by four of them . 4 Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd , they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and , after digging through it , lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on . 5 When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , "" Son , your sins are forgiven . "" 6 Now some teachers of the law were sitting there , thinking to themselves , 7 "" Why does this fellow talk like that ? He 's blaspheming ! Who can forgive sins but God alone ? "" 8 Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts , and he said to them , "" Why are you thinking these things ? 9 Which is easier : to say to the paralytic , ' Your sins are forgiven , ' or to say , ' Get up , take your mat and walk ' ? 10 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ... "" He said to the paralytic , 11 "" I tell you , get up , take your mat and go home . "" 12 He got up , took his mat and walked out in full view of them all . This amazed everyone and they praised God , saying , "" We have never seen anything like this ! "" The Calling of Levi 13 Once again Jesus went out beside the lake . A large crowd came to him , and he began to teach them . 14 As he walked along , he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth . "" Follow me , "" Jesus told him , and Levi got up and followed him . 15 While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house , many tax collectors and "" sinners "" were eating with him and his disciples , for there were many who followed him . 16 When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the "" sinners "" and tax collectors , they asked his disciples : "" Why does he eat with tax collectors and ' sinners ' ? "" 17 On hearing this , Jesus said to them , "" It is not the healthy who need a doctor , but the sick . I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners . "" Jesus Questioned About Fasting 18 Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting . Some people came and asked Jesus , "" How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting , but yours are not ? "" 19 Jesus answered , "" How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them ? They can not , so long as they have him with them . 20 But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them , and on that day they will fast . 21 "" No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment . If he does , the new piece will pull away from the old , making the tear worse . 22 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins . If he does , the wine will burst the skins , and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined . No , he pours new wine into new wineskins . "" Lord of the Sabbath 23 One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields , and as his disciples walked along , they began to pick some heads of grain . 24 The Pharisees said to him , "" Look , why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath ? "" 25 He answered , "" Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need ? 26 In the days of Abiathar the high priest , he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread , which is lawful only for priests to eat . And he also gave some to his companions . "" 27 Then he said to them , "" The Sabbath was made for man , not man for the Sabbath . 28 So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath . """	6

1407	Finding a Quality West Highland Terrier Breeder A quality breeder may be difficult to find on many occasions because it is rather easy to breed these small dogs and even easier to get them passed as whatever breed you would prefer , including the West Highland White Terrier . Hence , it would take a real effort to find out about which of the hundreds of breeders out there is actually a quality West Highland Terrier breeder . Interview the West Highland Terrier Breeder and Look for the Right Signs 1 . A quality breeder will ordinarily have the puppies within their house , and not a demarcated area outside the normal living quarters . These dogs need to be socialized early in their life , and if they do not get it at the right time , they might develop as aggressive animals . A good West Highland Terrier breeder will know this , and have them socialized very early in life . 2 . These dogs are very temperamental initially . They need to be trained early and with consistence , so ' good manners ' become part of their nature . A good breeder will either have them trained , or if you are taking them away too early , warn you about this requirement . 3 . A quality West Highland Terrier breeder is very proud and possessive about his brood . He / she will be very reluctant to let go of their puppies until they are more than assured that you are the best possible owner for it . Be prepared to be interviewed at length and visited at home as well . The quality breeder will look forward to develop a relationship with you so it will be able to keep a tab on its puppy . 4 . A quality breeder will ask you to sign a contract which binds you to return the puppy ( or adult ) West Highland Terrier if for any reason whatsoever , you would not be able to take care of it any longer .

305	Is Haditha just the tip of the mass grave | Main | Coucil of Europe report on extraordinary rendition out today  June 04 , 2006 Met chief could face charge over Menezes From The Observer The Crown Prosecution Service is considering legal charges against Britain's most senior police officer over the fatal shooting of Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes , mistakenly taken to be a terrorist . The Observer can reveal that the Metropolitan Police commissioner , Sir Ian Blair , and two senior commanders in control of the operation that culminated in de Menezes's death are the focus of the final legal analysis of the shooting by Crown prosecutors . If the CPS goes ahead with the dramatic move , the decision would pile further pressure on the already beleaguered head of Scotland Yard . Legal sources close to the CPS case have revealed that , following a four-month review of a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission , prosecutors are considering whether the command team are ultimately responsible , a decision that could give rise to a charge of gross negligence manslaughter against Blair and two other senior figures . Posted by andrew on June 4 , 2006 11 : 20 AM in the category 7 UK Policy Comments I 'm not convinced this one will actually fly , but it 's interesting to notice how tight-lipped Scotland Yard is being over the latest ' tragic mistake ' in east London . I 'll bet there are a few worried ( desperate ? ) senior cops and spooks right now . If they ca n ' t get any ' evidence ' together shortly it 's going to be ever so embarrassing . And note the constantly changing unattributable stories about the circumstances of both the shooting and the type of ' bomb ' . Yes indeed , news management at its finest .

723	Come gather round me comrades , and hear my little lecture , The bourgeois world is haunted by Communism's spectre - Thus wrote Karl & Freddy - their words I will relate , from the Manifesto of 1848 . All History tells a tale of struggles between classes - Slaves & freemen , serfs & lords , labourers & masters , [ in a word ] Oppressor and oppressed fought in constant opposition , While the modern bourgeois rise like scum to dominant position . The bourgeoisie converts the family to but a cash relation . For feudal ties it substitutes more brutal exploitation , All that 's solid melts . All that 's sacred is profaned . By bourgeois competition and bourgeois money gain . Their commercial crises are such an absurdity , They show we can no longer afford the bourgeoisie It is unfit to rule , it can not feed its slaves , And so the bourgeoisie creates , the digger of its grave : The working class must win the battle of democracy , And expropriate all capital from the bourgeoisie . So the workers control all industry , and create a workers' state , which ends all exploitation & a free world does create The Communists encourage the working class to see The class antagonism between prole & bourgeoisie They openly declare their aims include the abolition Of existing social & political conditions . Communists disdain to conceal their views & aims . The workers have no country , and nought to lose but chains . They have a world to win . Let the ruling class take fright , at communist revolution - workers everywhere unite ! Copyright Eric Petersen Updated : 20 February , 2006 | Site editor	0
298	"News & Events news Waiting list relief for Scottish patients Waiting times to see a specialist about hearing problems have been slashed in the Lothians after hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent on new testing rooms . Deaf and hard of hearing patients now wait an average of around seven months to see an audiologist and have a hearing aid fitted - down from more than 18 months two years ago . Waiting times are set to fall even further with the appointment of a further six audiologists at the Ear , Nose and Throat ( ENT ) department at Lauriston Place . But the latest figures still fall three weeks short of the Scottish Executive's target of 26 weeks , which came into force in March this year . Nanette Milne , health spokeswoman for the Scottish Tories , said : "" It is very good news for people in Edinburgh and the Lothians that waiting times have already been reduced and that new audiologists have been appointed . "" I am not too concerned about Executive waiting times , as long as the needs of patients are being met and the fact that the wait has been cut by so much is fantastic . "" She added : "" I know waiting lists in audiology have meant people have been waiting a terribly long time to have hearing aids fitted . "" The new permanent staff will replace locums who are currently carrying out the work , saving NHS Lothian £ 180,000 a year . Two have already started work , and the others are set to begin soon . Some of them will later be moved to the audiology department at St John's Hospital , Livingston . In February , the health authority spent £ 470,000 installing four new sound-proofed rooms to measure hearing ability at Lauriston Place . An extra 240 people a week are seen by audiologists since the booths were installed - a 60 per cent rise since February . But patients are still having to wait an average of 29 weeks from being referred by their GP to having a hearing aid fitted . Mark Hamilton , manager of the ENT department at Lauriston Place , said : "" These additions to the audiology department are great news for patients . We have just revised our waiting list timetables which means people will now be getting access to treatment sooner . "" Over the next few months we are also expecting a big increase in the number of patients attending our department . "" Hearing problems are a major disadvantage to a lot of people and our patients can rest assured that NHS Lothian is always striving to deliver high quality health services . "" A Scottish Executive spokeswoman said : "" We are committed to a programme of modernisation of audiology services in Scotland , and to making available digital hearing aids where there is a clinical need . All boards can now fit digital hearing aids if appropriate . "" A target of 26 weeks' waiting time from referral to fitting is being achieved by some , but not all , boards as the starting point for modernisation varied from board to board . "" Around £ 17 million has been made available to NHS boards over 2003-07 to modernise audiology services . I had just had enough so I decided to go privately Long waiting lists have forced some patients to have hearing aids fitted privately . Frank Cochrane , 73 , of Trinity , waited to see an NHS Lothian audiologist for nearly two years after being referred by his GP . He said : "" My hearing started to go very gradually more than three years ago . When I first went to see my GP , it had gone only a little bit , but by the time I got to the Ear , Nose and Throat , it was really quite bad . "" I have had terrible problems waiting to see someone at the NHS . Once I eventually did see someone at the hospital , they told me I would face another wait to have a hearing aid fitted . I had just had enough , so I decided to go privately . "" Mr Cochrane , who had one foot amputated earlier this year , contacted a private firm who came to his home to carry out tests and fit two hearing aids . He added : "" When I was in hospital having my foot amputated , I dropped my hearing aid and broke it . I decided to see if there was any way I could get it repaired on the NHS , but I was told I would have to join the bottom of the list again .

1476	A heart murmur is a result of faulty blood flow within the heart . The familiar ' lub-dub ' sound of the heartbeat is brought on by the rhythmic closing of the heart valves . A heart murmur is an additional humming or whooshing sound , taking place between the heartbeat sounds . Lots of kids have ' innocent ' heart murmurs that do not require treatment . Nevertheless a harmful heart murmur may be a result of congenital heart disorders , mitral regurgitation , aortic regurgitation , mitral stenosis , harm to the cardiac muscle , anaemia , hyperthyroidism or stress . The acquainted ' lub-dub ' sound of the heartbeat is caused by the rhythmic closing of the heart valves as the blood is pumped in and out from the chambers . A heart murmur is a sound brought on by blood flow within the heart . Instead of ' lub-dub ' , the heartbeat may have an added sound like a hum , a whoosh or a rasp . The reason for the whooshing sound is the vibration of blood as it circulates through the heart , that is generally undetectable by stethoscope . Blood can flow abnormally through the heart for several reasons including defective valves , congenital heart disorders as well as anaemia . A ' noisy ' heart is n't always a sign of health problem or malfunction . Several kids have ' innocent ' heart murmurs that do n't require any treatment or observation . However , medical tests are usually needed to distinguish between a hazardous heart murmur and an innocent one , since they could sound the same through a stethoscope . Symptoms Heart murmurs are themselves usually asymptomatic ( have no symptoms ) . Commonly , they are innocent and are only observed during a routine medical check-up . Abnormal Heart murmurs might be associated with numerous kinds of heart disease , especially those affecting the heart valves . The presence of heart disease may be recommended by : Pains in the chest muscles Tachycardia ( faster heart rate ) Heart palpitations Breathlessness Weakness Cyanosis ( blue tinge to the skin due to insufficient oxygen ) .

1616	"While it 's good news from a marketer's "" budget "" standpoint , I am concerned that too many marketers are simply telling their clients that they "" must use social media "" without giving the client a clear-cut reason or a plan directly tying the social media campaign to a product or service . All social media marketing must have a purpose . There are a number of terrific uses you can put social media to : Instead of developing a new product or service in secret and then hoping you can market or sell it , use social media to engage potential clients and customers right from the beginning to get their feedback and input . That way , by the time you 're ready to go to market , you have a ready fan base who feel like the product or service is theirs and will immediately buy it . A great example of "" direct response "" social media marketing is the use of Twitter by Kogi Korean BBQ-To-Go in LA . They have trucks roaming the streets of LA selling Korean tacos . They use Twitter to keep raving fans up-to-date on where there truck is at all times . They also use it to tell fans about company news and recipes posted on their blog or website . I once read a story about a new plant manager who was brought in to increase production on the plant floor . He did n't offer bonuses , he did n't "" give speeches to the troops , "" and he did n't threaten , cajole or harangue them . Instead , after the first shift finished , he asked the foreman what their production was . The foreman told him 385 . The plant manager told the foreman to print the numbers with chalk as big as he could on the wall by the locker room . And leave the chalk sitting on the floor . The second shift saw the numbers as they came online and started asking what they meant . The foreman casually let it drop that some "" show-off "" on the first shift was bragging about how many parts they had produced . He told them to ignore it . At the end of their shift , someone from the second shift scratched out the number and posted their results , which was higher . Someone from the third shift asked the guy what he was doing . "" Some clown on first shift was bragging about their production run . We kicked their butts . "" At the end of the third shift , a new number was scribbled on the wall . I think you can figure out what happened from there . Just keep thinking Tom Sawyer . So the question begs itself , could you use social media to do something similar within your company ? Perhaps generate a little healthy competition ?"	0
20	"The "" Browning "" of African Technology Forget MIT . Hello , Tsing Hua University . For Clothilde Tingiri , a hot young programmer at Rwanda's top software company , dreams of Beijing , not Cambridge , animate her ambitions . Desperate for more education , this fall she plans to attend graduate school for computer science – in China , not America . The Chinese are no strangers to Rwanda . Near Tingiri's office , Rwanda's largest telecom company , Rwandatel , is installing new wireless telephony equipment made by Huawei of Shenzen . Africa boasts the world's fastest-growing market for wireless telephony , and Huawei – with offices in 14 African countries – is running away with the business , sending scores of engineers into the bush to bring a new generation of low-cost technology to some of the planet's poorest people . Motivated by profit and market share rather than philanthropy , Huawei is outpacing American and European rivals through lower prices , faster action , and a greater willingness to work in difficult environments . According to Chris Lundh , the American chief of Rwandatel , "" That 's the way things work in Africa now . The Chinese do it all . "" Well , not quite . Across sub-Saharan Africa , engineers from India – armed with appropriate technologies honed in their home market – are also making their mark . India supplies Africa with computer-education courses , the most reliable water pumps , low-cost rice-milling equipment , and dozens of other technologies . The sudden influx of Chinese and Indian technologies represents the "" browning "" of African technology , which has long been the domain of "" white "" Americans and Europeans who want to apply their saving hand to African problems . "" It is a tectonic shift to the East with shattering implications , "" says Calestous Juma , a Kenyan professor at Harvard University who advises the African Union on technology policy . One big change is in education . There are roughly 2,000 African students in China , most of whom are pursuing engineering and science courses . According to Juma , that number is expected to double over the next two years , making China "" Africa's leading destination for science and engineering education . "" The "" browning "" of technology in Africa is only in its infancy , but the shift is likely to accelerate . Chinese and Indian engineers hail from places that have much more in common with nitty-gritty Africa than comfortable Silicon Valley or Cambridge . Africa also offers a testing ground for Asian-designed technologies that are not yet ready for US or European markets . A good example is a solar-powered cooking stove from India , which has experimented with such stoves for decades . Wood-burning stoves are responsible for much of Africa's deforestation , and , in many African cities , where wood accounts for the majority of cooking fuel , its price is soaring . The Indian stove is clearly a work-in-progress ; it is too bulky and not durable enough to survive the rigors of an African village . But with India's vast internal market , many designers have an incentive to improve it . How many designers in America or Europe can say the same ? Of course , technology transfer from China and India could be a mere smokescreen for a new "" brown imperialism "" aimed at exploiting African oil , food , and minerals . In recent years , China's government alone has invested billions of dollars in African infrastructure and resource extraction , raising suspicions that a new scramble for Africa is underway . But Africans genuinely need foreign technology , and the Chinese , in particular , are pushing hard – even flamboyantly – to fill the gap . This year , Nigeria's government bought a Chinese-made satellite , and even paid the Chinese to launch it into space in May . China was so eager to provide space technology to Africa's most populous country that it beat out 21 other bidders for a contract worth $ 300 million . China's technology inroads are usually less dramatic , but no less telling . In African medicine , Chinese herbs and pharmaceuticals are quietly gaining share . For example , the Chinese-made anti-malarial drug artesunate has become part of the standard treatment within just a few years . Likewise , Chinese mastery over ultra-small , cheap "" micro-hydro "" dams , which can generate tiny amounts of electricity from mere trickles of water , appeals to power-short , river-rich Africans . Tens of thousands of micro-hydro systems operate in China , and nearly none in Africa . Americans do-gooders like Nicholas Negroponte , with his $ 100 laptop , have identified the right problem : Africa is way behind technologically and rapid leap-frogging is possible . But Chinese and Indian scientists argue that Africa can benefit from a changing of the technological guard . They may be right ."	0

Hamas officials say military commander Izz el-Deen al-Sheikh Khalil was killed Sunday morning while starting his car . Hamas immediately blamed Israel for the attack , and officials in the Gaza Strip threatened to carry out reprisals against Israeli targets abroad . But a Hamas official in Lebanon says no such decision has been made . In Damascus , the Syrian news agency called the attack an assassination , and said Israel bears full responsibility for its consequences . Israel has not commented . But early this month , Israeli authorities promised to strike Hamas leaders abroad .

1661	"Oscar De La Hoya vs. Manny Pacquiao , also billed as The Dream Match , was a professional boxing welterweight superfight . The bout took place on December 6 , 2008 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena , Las Vegas , Nevada , United States . Pacquiao defeated De La Hoya via technical knockout when De La Hoya decided not to continue with the fight before the start of the ninth round . The card was a co-production of Bob Arum ' s Top Rank Boxing and De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions and was aired live on pay-per-view ( PPV ) on HBO PPV . The fight is notable for propelling Manny Pacquiao to full-blown superstar status in much of the western world ( mostly in The United States ) , as Oscar De La Hoya symbolically "" passed the torch "" , so to speak , to Pacquiao . Despite no title belts being disputed , the bout received a lot of publicity since the two boxers were decorated , with Pacquiao being the current number one pound for pound boxer in the world as judged by The Ring , and a five-time world champion in five different weight divisions ( Pacquiao was the reigning WBC lightweight champion at the time of the bout ) . Meanwhile , De La Hoya was an Olympic gold medalist and past holder of 10 world titles in six weight divisions . Pacquiao had to step up two weight divisions ( from lightweight ) , and De La Hoya had to go down one weight division ( from light middleweight ) , to be eligible for the bout's welterweight division . The ideas of having De La Hoya and Pacquiao fight came from HBO boxing analyst Larry Merchant talking with ESPN boxing analyst Dan Rafael . Larry then presented the idea to Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer and Top Rank CEO Bob Arum . Bob presented the idea to Manny Pacquiao trainer Freddie Roach . It was even mentioned on the PPV broadcast that it was Larry's idea , even mentioning Dan Rafael by name . Freddie Roach since the De La Hoya - Mayweather fight has said in the media and in the De La Hoya / Pacquiao 24 / 7 series , press conferences , promos leading to the Dream Match that Oscar "" ca n't pull the trigger anymore . "" After De La Hoya's May 5 loss to Floyd Mayweather , Jr. in 2007 ( see De La Hoya-Mayweather boxing match ) , De La Hoya decided to close out his career with three fights in 2008 . The first would be a tune-up bout in May before finishing with two mega bouts in September and December respectively . De La Hoya defeated Stevie Forbes in the May tune-up bout in preparation for Mayweather . Due to Mayweather's unexpected retirement however , Ricky Hatton was the new potential candidate to fight De La Hoya on September 20 . However , Hatton rejected the offer because he felt the scheduled date was too close to his last bout . De La Hoya then decided to pass on a fight in September to set the stage for a showdown against either Manny Pacquiao or Miguel Cotto , should Cotto win his fight against Antonio Margarito in July . After Cotto was defeated by Margarito , it was announced that De La Hoya and Pound For Pound superstar Manny Pacquiao had agreed to fight December 6 , 2008 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas at the welterweight limit of 147 lbs. On August 28 , 2008 , a teleconference was held by Golden Boy Promotions to officially announce the fight . Presented by Golden Boy Promotions and Top Rank , Inc. , the bout was scheduled as a 12-round , non-title fight contested at the 147-pound welterweight limit . Although Pacquiao went into the fight recognized as the leading pound-for-pound boxer in the world , some boxing pundits speculated that 147 pounds could be too far above his natural weight against the larger De La Hoya . Many boxing analysts believed the fight would favor Oscar . Boxing analysts stated that Oscar's size , reach , experience , and good chin made Manny the underdog in this mega fight . Training for the fight Oscar hired trainers Angelo Dundee , Ignacio "" Nacho "" Beristain , and young boxing talent Edwin Valero . Oscar told the news that his team is unbeatable , while Freddie Roach said , "" No one is going to be able to help Oscar pull the trigger when he faces Manny Pacquiao on Dec. 6 "" . Tickets reportedly sold out just hours after they went on sale . The total gate revenues were said to be nearly $ 17 million . That amount apparently gave the bout the second-largest gate revenue in boxing history ( after the De La Hoya-Mayweather Jr. fight on May 5 , 2007 which generated $ 18 . 4 million in gate revenue ) . Manny Pacquiao soundly defeated Oscar De La Hoya , surprising many pre-fight analysts who had predicted a victory by De La Hoya . The fight ended at the beginning of the 9th round after Oscar and his corner threw in the towel . On round 1 , De La Hoya's opening punches miss Pacquiao ; Pacquiao's own straight left followed by a combination connects . The boxers exchange punches , with another Pacquiao straight left to end the round . At the start of the second round , a double jab by De La Hoya persuades Pacquiao to retreat . Only the second of De La Hoya's two combinations hits Pacquiao . A combo from Pacquiao leaves De La Hoya's face reddened . A flurry of punches from Pacquiao ends the round . The third round is more of the same as De La Hoya becomes increasingly unable to answer Pacquiao's combos . Pacquiao unleashes a flurry of punches in round 5 ; De La Hoya saw it coming but was n't able to react fast enough . De La Hoya himself lands a body shot and a couple of hooks , but the two boxers exchange punches at the end of the round . The next round begins as the last ended , with the men exchanging jabs . Pacquiao appears winded as he misses a left hook , but the follow-up lands on target . Pacquiao lands a right , and a four-punch combo to end the round . In Round 7 , Pacquiao lands a jab as De La Hoya misses his ; Pacquiao unleashes another flurry of punches as De La Hoya's legs almost gave out , just as he ceased punching back . His uppercut misses Pacquiao as his opponent releases more jabs to end round 7 . Pacquiao pursues De La Hoya's body but is warned by referee Tony Weeks to "" keep them up "" ( keep punches above the belt ) . De La Hoya's right connects , but Pacquiao's combo pins De La Hoya in the corner . Another left by Pacquiao dazes the Mexican-American , as the Filipino follows up with another combination which wobbles De La Hoya . Pacquiao throws another combo as De La Hoya goes for the body . The Filipino unleashes a four-punch combo to end the round . The fight is stopped before the start of the ninth round and Pacquiao is awarded the victory . Pacquiao was ahead on all three judges' scorecards before the stoppage , with two judges scoring the fight at 80-71 ( Pacquiao won all rounds ) and one scoring it at 79 – 72 ( Pacquiao won 7 rounds and lost 1 ) . After the bout trainer Freddie Roach stated , "" We knew we had him after the first round . He had no legs , he was hesitant and he was shot . "" Confirming Roach's pre-fight predictions that he 'd grown too old , De La Hoya crossed the ring to Pacquiao's corner after the bout was stopped and told Roach , "" You 're right Freddie . I do n't have it anymore . "" When asked by reporters whether he would continue fighting , De La Hoya responded , "" My heart still wants to fight , that 's for sure . But when your physical does n't respond , what can you do ? I have to be smart and make sure I think about my future plans . "" On December 10 , 2008 , HBO announced that the fight generated 1.25 million PPV buys totalling more than $ 70 million in PPV revenue . This fight was only the fourth non-heavyweight bout to have more than one million buys at that time , along with De La Hoya – Mayweather Jr. ( 2 . 4 million buys ) in May 2007 , De La Hoya – Hopkins ( 1 million buys ) in 2004 , and De La Hoya – Trinidad ( 1 . 4 million buys ) in 1999 .

1339	"Beware toxic chemicals in imported clothing CHOICE says Australia lags behind overseas regulation CHOICE says that inadequate chemical regulation for imported textiles , clothing and footwear means that consumers are unaware that they could be wearing toxic chemicals . In a report into chemicals in textiles , clothing and footwear ( TCF ) , the people's watchdog says Australian chemical regulation lags behind other countries . As a result , Australians are exposed to higher risks of allergic reactions to chemicals in new clothes , footwear and even furniture . "" Over ninety percent of the clothes on Australian shelves are imported . The trend for ' fast fashion ' also means that retailers are under pressure to put more stock on shelves , more often , "" says CHOICE spokesperson , Ingrid Just . "" That pressure , combined with our inadequate chemical regulation for apparel , means that consumers have less protection than people in other countries where regulation is stronger . "" The European Union's ' EU Reach ' legislation regulates the use of more than 300 thousand harmful substances used in textile , clothing and footwear . EU Reach also sets maximum chemical limits for TCF products that come into contact with human skin . The situation in Europe contrasts with that in Australia , where 50 thousand substances are overseen by the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme ( NICNAS ) – the Australian equivalent of EU Reach . Additionally , in Australia , there are no legally prescribed limits for the use of those substances in textiles . The CHOICE report cites the case of a woman who suffered chemical burns from new ballet style shoes when they were wet from rain . Subsequent tests by Monash University showed that the shoes were treated with a fungicide and rubber accelerator which was released when the shoes came into contact with water . "" A CHOICE member contacted us about her experience of suffering a burning sensation two hours after putting on a pair of new bowling shoes . She told the supplier , who dismissed the complaint , but she has since contacted the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) . She has also sent the shoes away for testing . "" Others have come forward – including the mum of a 10 year old boy who suffered large hives and welts after wearing a new school shirt before it was washed , "" says Ms Just . One mould prevention chemical commonly found in shoes , jackets and furniture is dimethyl fumarate ( DMF ) . The chemical , which is often found in small satchels in the product packaging , has been linked to eczema . DMF is banned in the EU but its use is widespread in Australia . Industry stakeholders including the CSIRO , the RMIT University , the National Toxics Network and the Australian Wool Testing Authority have recently joined the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia ( TFIA ) to work on product safety , including chemicals in clothing . Bodies such as the TFIA and RMIT University have told CHOICE they are shocked by the lack of active Australian regulation . They say that , even though consumer reactions to chemicals in clothing and footwear are not rife , an issue that should n't exist at all is actually growing . "" It would be impossible to import some of these chemicals to use in Australia , but there 's no problem in having the same chemicals arrive in an order of T shirts from overseas , "" says Ms Just . CHOICE says anyone who has concerns about an item of clothing , textiles or footwear , should contact the retailer and the ACCC on 1300 303 609 . CHOICE's tips for consumers : 1 . Wash new clothes before you wear them – keep in mind though , that washing may not remove all chemicals . 2 . When buying for children , look for natural fibres , cotton , linen and wool . 3 . If concerned about allergic reactions , look for clothing made with organic cottons , with the use of natural vegetable dyes . 4 . Avoid ' stain or water resistant ' labelled clothing , unless the manufacturer provides details of the chemicals or processes used ."	2

Small angle X-ray scattering reveals changes of bone mineral habit and size in archaeological bone samples . ( 2000 ) Fibre Diffraction Review 9 36-43 X-ray scattering provides a powerful non-destructive technique capable of providing important information about the size , habit and arrangement of mineral crystals in bone . In the case of archaeological bone the changes in the habit of the apatite crystals and recrystallised material may reflect the changes in bone environment that have occurred since death . In the study presented here we have examined a variety of archaeological bones by small-angle X-ray scattering to show the alterations in bone habit that can be adopted after ' diagenetic remodelling ' . Furthermore we show that the use of small-angle scattering microfocus technology allows us to probe into the fine structure alterations that can occur in bone as a result of microbial attack and mineral recrystallisation . The integrity of the bone crystallites has a strong correlation with the ability to extract other biomolecules from bone such as osteocalcin and DNA . Alterations in the crystallite habit may explain the success of macromolecule recovery from archaeological samples .	3
1518	"Nonverbal Communication Help for Salespeople Dear Sue : I am fairly new to an outside sales position and am looking for information about non-verbal communication . I am interested in learning about office settings . Any other information that can help me to ' read ' a situation better would be appreciated . - Amy Sue Says : During the average 30-minute sales call , a buyer and seller exchange approximately 800 different nonverbal messages , yet most salespeople focus on the verbal part of the sale , according to Jan Hargrave , a body language consultant and author of the book , Strictly Business Body Language . Salespeople who pay attention to body language typically focus almost exclusively on facial expressions . However , the way words are spoken and the speakers face all provide information about how the sales call is going . The voice and face are only part of the picture . The body is the communication channel over which we have the least control and understand the least , but has the most impact . Where you sit and how the furniture is arranged can either encourage friendliness and cooperation or confrontation . Hargrave says that sitting across the table from a person during a negotiation creates a defensive , competitive atmosphere and can lead to each party taking a firm stand on his or her point of view . The table becomes a solid barrier between both parties and allows for a distinct division of ideas . Massive desks create a physical barrier , and serve as a visual barrier as well . If you ca n't see someone from the chest down , you do n't know if the buyer's legs are crossed , if he 's tapping his foot or cleaning his nails . Office furniture can be arranged in a way to give a person as much power , status or control over others as they wish . Just sitting behind a desk conveys a sense of power and positioning because all who enter must look across it , which gives the person behind it control . Increased status and power can be achieved with : Low sofas for visitors to sit on . A wall covered with photos , awards or qualifications that the occupant has received . A slim briefcase ; those who do all the work carry large , bulky briefcases . Red folders on a desk marked "" Strictly Confidential . "" An expensive ashtray placed out of reach of the visitor causing him inconvenience when ashing a cigarette . ( I do not recommend smoking on a sales call , however . ) You are wise to take in a person's environment to learn more about that person . If you are having trouble communicating with someone , moving to a new location , changing positions or getting him or her to come out from behind a desk can change the dynamics of the interaction ."	7
1581	"Senior agricultural sector authorities visited three sustainable agriculture farms in Costa Rica ; will attempt to promote the application of such practices in their country ACCORDING TO DAVID ESTWICK , Minister of Agriculture , Food , Fisheries , Industry and Small Business Development of Barbados , finding a way to ensure that cooperation goes beyond regional fora and actually reaches their framers , and supporting the modernization of agricultural sector institutions , are two of the most important objectives of the relationship between IICA and Barbados . On his visit to Headquarters , Estwick was accompanied by Deputy Minister Ralph Farnum . The visit was organized by IICA's Hemispheric Center for Leadership in Agriculture , under its Forum for Leaders in Agriculture program . He is the fourteenth minister or secretary of agriculture to participate in these official visits , said Hernan Chiriboga , Coordinator of the Center . During his meeting with the managers , Minister Estwick stated it was necessary to "" change the reality "" in some Caribbean states , which are in need of technological tools that will ensure that innovation reaches farmers and contribute to making them more competitive . According to James French , Director of Technical Cooperation , the IICA 2012-2014 Medium-term Plan calls for strengthening the technical cooperation provided in the Caribbean , since it is clear that global situations , such a climate change and the need to gain a foothold in external markets , make it necessary for agriculture to become more competitive . For his part , the Director of Management and Regional Integration , Victor del Ángel , explained to Minister Estwick that the Institute only implements actions in its 34 Member States with the approval of the corresponding minister of agriculture . Practical examples Eighteen years ago , this small this small-scale agribusiness switched from traditional to more sustainable agricultural practices . On some six hectares of land , cattle , goats , hogs and poultry are raised and vegetables grown . Its food products , organic fertilizer , energy from methane gas , and other products for sale make the farm almost self-sufficient . To demonstrate the sustainable methods it applies and to earn additional income , La Esperanza also engages in agro-eco-tourism . "" I am taking a lot of ideas back with me to Barbados , where many farmers work plots approximately this size , using chemical fertilizers , "" said Estwick . The minister and deputy minister were also able to observe greenhouse techniques when they visited the Agricultores Cartagineses CyC Company , where tomato plants are protected from rain , wind and ultraviolet rays with low-cost reusable materials . At the Almácigos San Isidro Company , the visitors witnessed how , via the controlled and protected planting of seeds in greenhouses , it is also possible to provide farmers with crops that are more pest-resistant which will make their farms more productive . On this farm , certified lettuce , tomato , green onion , sweet pepper , broccoli and other seeds are planted in organic soil that has been sterilized with hulled rice , sugar cane bagasse and steam . The resulting plantlets are then delivered to farmers who have ordered them . According to Estwick and Farnum , Barbados , given its geographic location , is very susceptible to severe weather that can affect their plantations . Both felt that what they had observed in Costa Rica could have practical applications in their country . The visit concluded with a meeting with Victor M. Villalobos , Director General of IICA , to discuss topics related to cooperation , which would be provided by the IICA Office in Barbados ."	8

1617	"Congratulations to California who 's citizens are fighting their own "" local "" One Bay plan that is so very similar to what is being offered above as VibrantNEO . Perhaps Cleveland and Akron , like Detroit , have no future and the future is actually smaller communities , smaller governments , that are better able manage their money , their children's education , and their residents' future – an option NOT provided in the "" ImagineMyNEO "" game . VibrantNEO is discrimminatory to the disabled and the poor . As you can tell by the recent urban renewal , high rises with small retail stores is the direction that will be "" sustainable "" . Smart meters will be implemented so that central air can be turned off for periods during the day . Do you know how hot high rises get without central air , how fast the food goes bad in a warm fridge ? Ultimately this plan makes it so you work within 20 minutes of where you live . Limited parking spaces to reduce cars . If you are poor , you probably ca n't afford the parking spaces that will cost more . You will be limited to finding a job within your 20 minute sphere of mostly small retail businesses . Has anyone taken a bus from Cleveland Clinic to downtown ? Its a very long ride and just think if you have to ride to go to a new job & back . Do n't forget that after you take the bus to and from work you are to maintain your local "" city plot "" for fresh vegetables . Food will be more expensive , because they ca n't buy quantity if the stores are small . Highland Square still does n't have a grocery , after they drove out the last one for trying to make a 3 % profit ! When will city planners come up with a new idea , not just one repackaged as "" green "" . High rises were called tenements in the early 20th century , we tore down the "" projects "" in the 70's and 80's ( projects were the answer to the tenement slums ) , and now we 're building "" luxury apartments "" as the panacea again ( future "" projects "" ) . Higher the density , higher the crime . ODOT wants to take out Akron's one way streets and put back in the 2-way streets . Really ? Really ? In California and Arizona the EPA is using the "" Clean water act "" to restrict building houses , businesses , and to take away land rights . And all this utopia will be under the Akron and Cleveland / Summit and Cuyahoga County government oversight . Who do you think are the people in attendance at these meetings ? – the Akron , Cleveland , Summit , and Cuyahoga government workers – job security ! Is this really the future you want for your children ? If it is , then you better start taxing the electric cars and bicycles or you will probably not have any roads maintained . There wo n't be any cars fueled by gasoline ( which is a "" natural "" resource folks ) to pay the gasoline taxes to build the roads . That "" 20 minute sphere "" of living your life is closing in . And for the twentysomethings – how do you think your phones , music , coffee bars , and electric cars are powered – natural gas and coal powered plants . And the future will bring the EPA clean-up of toxic electric cars' dead batteries , something the environmentalists are turning a blind eye to now .

1386	"Here 's a quick & dirty of the ' trouble ' currently plaguing Paula Deen . A former employee of Deen and her brother Bubba Hiers filed a lawsuit against them , citing both sexual and racial discrimination . At the forefront of the allegations were Deen's own racist remarks and her usage of the "" n-word . "" During her deposition , Deen admitted that she had used the word before on several occasions . She insisted that neither she nor her family were racist or stereotyped or discriminated against any race or gender . But the racially-charged language she readily used ( and admitted to ) suggested something entirely different . During her deposition she even admitted to planning an old fashioned southern event , complete with a black-only staff of servants . She stated that she decided against the party because of the obvious backlash and public relations problems that would have obviously resulted from it . Once all this information became public , people began to come out of the woodwork to condemn Deen , her show , and her apparently racist position . She immediately released a video apology that appeared rushed , forced , half-hearted , and disingenuous . She later released a second apology which brought a similar amount of ire . Most opponents claimed that Deen did n't mean what she was saying when she apologized and that she was forced into it to try and save face . But unfortunately for Paula Deen , her apologies most definitely did not save face . Funny thing – in show business today , most people do n't take too kindly to racism . In the wake of this sensation , the Food Network decided against renewing Deen's contract ( which expired yesterday ) . And many of her other publishers and networks have followed suit . As mentioned already , Deen's publisher has dropped her for the upcoming release of her cookbook . As an ABC News report describes , her networks and agencies dropping her include the following : Smithfield Pork : An international distributor of all sorts of pork products Wal-Mart : Wal-Mart has decided against ordering any new Paula Deen based products in the wake of this news . Target : Target stores will also be phasing out all Paula Deen merchandise from their retail outlets and online stores . Home Depot : Home Depot also announced that they were cutting ties with Deen and no longer carrying her cookware and other merchandise . Novo Nordisk : The manufacturer of Type 2 Diabetes drugs , Novo Nordisk had Deen as a spokeswoman when she revealed she was suffering with the disease . She 'll suspend operations as a spokeswoman to focus her efforts on her current debacle . Caesars Entertainment : This company had used Deen's name in a variety of restaurants in several places on the east side of the country . They plan to re-brand the restaurants and phase out Deen's name altogether . QVC : QVC is suspending sales of Deen-related merchandise , although they claim the severing of sales is only temporary . J.C. Penney : Based on all the bad press , J.C. Penney will be phasing out all Deen merchandise from their stores . Sears and Kmart : Both stores also decided to abandon the Paula Deen ship due to all the negative press . Walgreens : All Deen-branded food products will be slowly phased out and no longer reordered for this pharmacy chain . With a list this expansive , can you say witch hunt ? Poor Paula is lucky she was n't cast out of the country and placed into exile for her misdeeds . But the truth here is pretty apparent : no company wants to keep themselves linked to something when it stinks . And the current situation with Paula Deen definitely stinks . A Look on the Other Side Let 's take a moment to play devil's advocate and argue in defense of Deen . Think about her background and her upbringing . She was born in the 1940s in the south . She came from a fairly lucrative family background of rich , white southern blood . It 's no surprise that language like this was common for her in her upbringing . In her deposition , you ca n't fault Paula Deen for being completely open and honest about her misstep . She was willing to admit that yes , she has used the racial slur before . She admitted that she had probably used it several times , too . That sort of honesty is uncommon for someone in a position like Deen's . At least you can commend her for that . But you ca n't commend her for allowing that racism and that type of language to continue long after her southern youth . The suit alleging her discrimination came long after she had come into celebrity prominence . If she was indeed non-discriminatory toward any race or gender , then why was this sort of conduct continuing to occur ? There 's no explanation that could justify the use of racist language for any reason . Unfortunately for her , Deen is paying dearly for her mistakes . Her entire empire is crumbling before her ( at an extremely rapid rate , too ) . She 's losing traction in all the areas that have made her a fortune and a celebrity . And all of this is because of actions she has taken – and has continued to take – even though she asserts she was n't racist and did n't discriminate . As unfortunately as the situation is for her , there 's no one Deen can blame but herself ."	8
1218	"Landslide ' buried woman as she slept ' in Looe A neighbour of a woman who died when a landslide engulfed her home , has told an inquest he had to clamber over a torrent of mud and water to escape . Susan Norman , 68 , died in March 2013 when the landslide , during torrential rain , poured into her flat in Looe , Cornwall , burying her in her bed . A post-mortem report read to the jury at Truro Magistrates' Court said Mrs Norman died immediately . The inquest is expected to last until 24 November . More on the landslide inquest and other news from Cornwall Mrs Norman lived in the ground-floor flat of a house split into three apartments . It was built into the hillside with a retaining wall behind the property . The jury also heard building work had taken place to the rear of the property before the incident . Dwayne Bown , who was asleep in one of the first floor flats , said he initially thought a tree behind the house had fallen down before the house jolted and the ground dropped in front of him . "" I then saw mud and water coming down into the landing as I was trying to get out ; the entrance was blocked completely and I had to climb over dirt and water and mud to get out , "" he said . In the weeks before the landslide , the court heard a bulge had formed in the wall behind the house . Rowan Beckingham , who lived in the other first-floor flat , said in the days prior to the landslide the landlady had told him she was commissioning repairs to the wall to the rear of the property . He said he had subsequently witnessed builders "" digging a hole in the cliff behind the house and pumping concrete into it "" ."	8
775	The biosynthesis of disaccharides , oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyltransferases . These are enzymes that catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules , forming glycosidic bonds . A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar , nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates ( 2 . 4 . 1 . - ) and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described [ 1 ] . This classification is available on the CAZy ( CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes ) web site [ 2 ] . The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families . Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences , several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form ' clans ' . Glycosyltransferase family 28 GT_28 comprises enzymes with a number of known activities ; 1 , 2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-galactosyltransferase ( 2 . 4 . 1 . 46 ) ; 1 , 2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-glucosyltransferase ( 2 . 4 . 1 . 157 ) ; beta-N-acetylglucosamine transferase ( 2 . 4 . 1 . - ) . Structural analysis suggests the C-terminal domain contains the UDP-GlcNAc binding site .	3

31	"Ruth 1 Naomi and Ruth 1 In the days when the judges ruled , [ a ] there was a famine in the land , and a man from Bethlehem in Judah , together with his wife and two sons , went to live for a while in the country of Moab . 2 The man's name was Elimelech , his wife's name Naomi , and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion . They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem , Judah . And they went to Moab and lived there . 3 Now Elimelech , Naomi's husband , died , and she was left with her two sons . 4 They married Moabite women , one named Orpah and the other Ruth . After they had lived there about ten years , 5 both Mahlon and Kilion also died , and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband . 6 When she heard in Moab that the LORD had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them , Naomi and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there . 7 With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah . 8 Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law , "" Go back , each of you , to your mother's home . May the LORD show kindness to you , as you have shown to your dead and to me . 9 May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband . "" Then she kissed them and they wept aloud 10 and said to her , "" We will go back with you to your people . "" 11 But Naomi said , "" Return home , my daughters . Why would you come with me ? Am I going to have any more sons , who could become your husbands ? 12 Return home , my daughters ; I am too old to have another husband . Even if I thought there was still hope for me – even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons – 13 would you wait until they grew up ? Would you remain unmarried for them ? No , my daughters . It is more bitter for me than for you , because the LORD's hand has gone out against me ! "" 14 At this they wept again . Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by , but Ruth clung to her . 15 "" Look , "" said Naomi , "" your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods . Go back with her . "" 16 But Ruth replied , "" Do n't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you . Where you go I will go , and where you stay I will stay . Your people will be my people and your God my God . 17 Where you die I will die , and there I will be buried . May the LORD deal with me , be it ever so severely , if anything but death separates you and me . "" 18 When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her , she stopped urging her . 19 So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem . When they arrived in Bethlehem , the whole town was stirred because of them , and the women exclaimed , "" Can this be Naomi ? "" 20 "" Do n't call me Naomi , [ b ] "" she told them . "" Call me Mara , [ c ] because the Almighty [ d ] has made my life very bitter . 21 I went away full , but the LORD has brought me back empty . Why call me Naomi ? The LORD has afflicted [ e ] me ; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me . "" 22 So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter-in-law , arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning . Ruth 2 Ruth Meets Boaz 1 Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side , from the clan of Elimelech , a man of standing , whose name was Boaz . 2 And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi , "" Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor . "" Naomi said to her , "" Go ahead , my daughter . "" 3 So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters . As it turned out , she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz , who was from the clan of Elimelech . 4 Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters , "" The LORD be with you ! "" "" The LORD bless you ! "" they called back . 5 Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters , "" Whose young woman is that ? "" 6 The foreman replied , "" She is the Moabitess who came back from Moab with Naomi . 7 She said , ' Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters . ' She went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now , except for a short rest in the shelter . "" 8 So Boaz said to Ruth , "" My daughter , listen to me . Do n't go and glean in another field and do n't go away from here . Stay here with my servant girls . 9 Watch the field where the men are harvesting , and follow along after the girls . I have told the men not to touch you . And whenever you are thirsty , go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled . "" 10 At this , she bowed down with her face to the ground . She exclaimed , "" Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me – a foreigner ? "" 11 Boaz replied , "" I 've been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband – how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before . 12 May the LORD repay you for what you have done . May you be richly rewarded by the LORD , the God of Israel , under whose wings you have come to take refuge . "" 13 "" May I continue to find favor in your eyes , my lord , "" she said . "" You have given me comfort and have spoken kindly to your servant – though I do not have the standing of one of your servant girls . "" 14 At mealtime Boaz said to her , "" Come over here . Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar . "" When she sat down with the harvesters , he offered her some roasted grain . She ate all she wanted and had some left over . 15 As she got up to glean , Boaz gave orders to his men , "" Even if she gathers among the sheaves , do n't embarrass her . 16 Rather , pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up , and do n't rebuke her . "" 17 So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening . Then she threshed the barley she had gathered , and it amounted to about an ephah . [ a ] 18 She carried it back to town , and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered . Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough . 19 Her mother-in-law asked her , "" Where did you glean today ? Where did you work ? Blessed be the man who took notice of you ! "" Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working . "" The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz , "" she said . 20 "" The LORD bless him ! "" Naomi said to her daughter-in-law . "" He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead . "" She added , "" That man is our close relative ; he is one of our kinsman-redeemers . "" 21 Then Ruth the Moabitess said , "" He even said to me , ' Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain . ' "" 22 Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law , "" It will be good for you , my daughter , to go with his girls , because in someone else 's field you might be harmed . "" 23 So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished . And she lived with her mother-in-law ."	6
1144	"Critic The PlayStation 4 Pro is a new breed of console . It 's not going to replace the original system . Instead , it 's meant to tide over gamers who 've upgraded to new 4K TVs with fancy high-dynamic-range ( HDR ) lighting features . It 's a more significant step up than the Xbox One S , which is mostly centered around upscaling 4K content , but it 'll compete directly with Microsoft's bigger console upgrade , Project Scorpio , next year . Welcome to the new era of gaming systems , which is beginning to resemble the world of PC games with a multitude of minor upgrades , rather than completely new system generations . ( Nintendo , ever the iconoclast , is trying to do something both new and traditional with the Switch . ) There 's no doubt that the $ 399 PlayStation 4 Pro is the closest we 've gotten to high-end PC-quality graphics on a home console . But the thing is , it 's not going to be a major upgrade for existing PS4 owners . And to really see the benefits of its faster hardware , you 'll have to wait for games to get upgraded . At the very least , though , it 's a welcome reward for anyone who 's held off on buying a PlayStation 4 until now . Engadget Score Poor Uninspiring Good Excellent Key Pros Cons Not a huge upgrade for existing PS4 owners with 1080p TVs . No 4K Blu-ray drive . You 'll have to wait for games to get patched to take advantage of it . Summary The PlayStation 4 Pro is the most powerful home console yet , though you 'll need a 4K / HDR TV to truly take advantage of it . If you already have a PS4 and are stuck with a 1080p , you can wait before upgrade . Hardware Take Sony's original PlayStation 4 design , add another sharply angled layer on top , and you have the PlayStation 4 Pro . You could call it a triple-decker PS4 . It 's a tad taller than the original , but otherwise they look near identical , with the same general shape and black plastic case . The PlayStation 4 Pro extends a bit farther back than before , likely in order to make room for both a larger power supply and more powerful components . The PlayStation 4 Pro's front buttons are physical , rather than touch-sensitive , and they 're separated now , with the power button on the far left and eject on the far right . ( The original PS4's buttons are incredibly tiny and located right above and below each other , which has led to plenty of frustration among gamers . ) There are two USB 3.0 ports on the front , just like before , and an additional one in the rear . The latter is useful for connecting the PlayStation VR neatly without taking up one of the precious front USB ports .. Alongside the HDMI port is a standard power connection , an "" Aux "" output for the PlayStation camera , an optical audio port ( which is notably absent from the PS4 Slim ) , and an Ethernet jack . But forget aesthetics : What 's most important is what 's under the hood . And much of that is drool-worthy . The PS4 Pro packs in a speedier eight-core CPU ; a new 4 . 2-teraflop AMD Polaris GPU that 's twice as fast as the original PS4 ; a 1TB hard drive ; and 8GB of RAM . Just like the PS4 Slim , it also adds an 802 . 11ac 5GHz WiFi radio , which should make downloading games and large updates significantly faster . On paper , the PlayStation 4 Pro sounds more like a decent gaming PC than a console . Sony's revamped DualShock 4 also comes with the PS4 Pro , after first making its debut with the PS4 Slim . It 's functionally identical to the original controller , except the LED lighting from the front now carries over to a thin strip above the touch panel . That 's useful for figuring out things like which character you 're controlling in a multiplayer game . There are a handful of other minor aesthetic tweaks too , like using gray for the triggers and some buttons , but honestly they 're too minor to mention . If you 've held a DualShock 4 before , you wo n't feel much of a difference here . While the PS4 Pro is packed to the gills with fresh hardware , there is one surprising omission : a 4K Blu-ray drive . That 's something the Xbox One S includes , and for $ 100 less than the PS4 Pro , too . Forgoing 4K Blu-ray is particularly surprising because Sony is one of the main backers of the Blu-ray format . It would be like Microsoft choosing to dump support for Word files in its next OS ; it 's hard to fathom why they 'd do it . Sony says it 's focusing on 4K / HDR streaming with the PS4 Pro ( more on that below ) , but that does n't completely explain why it 's seemingly cutting off its own format at the knees . Did Sony forget that the PlayStation 2 was one of the big reasons DVDs took off so quickly ? In use I 've long argued that 4K is n't something consumers should get too worked up about , at least not yet . But , in preparation for testing the PlayStation 4 Pro , I bit the bullet and purchased LG's 55-inch B6 OLED TV . So , for once , I was actually excited about 4K . We 're also at the point where that format is finally beginning to make sense for mainstream consumers . 4K TVs are getting cheaper ( I was astounded to find an OLED set under $ 2 , 000 ) , there 's more high-resolution content out there , and HDR also makes a compelling case for upgrading ( even more so than 4K itself ) . Basically , it seems like we 've finally reached a point where 4K is n't just something being forced on us by TV makers . So it makes sense for Sony to jump aboard the bandwagon and introduce a console centered entirely around it . I should also point out that I 'm coming at this console after shifting much of my AAA gaming over to my PC . If I can get even better quality for the same price , and still pipe it conveniently to my living room from my PC , why would I choose a lesser console experience ? Indeed , the PS4 Pro's very existence seems designed to tempt PC gamers . After excitedly connecting all of the necessary cables , I booted up the PlayStation 4 Pro and honestly I was a bit disappointed just to see the same old PS4 home screen . It makes sense for Sony to avoid fragmenting its software too much , but still , I 'd like something to indicate it 's different . Then I started playing some games that were upgraded to support the new console and my mood changed considerably . The games I started off with The Last of Us : Remastered , a game that I know well after playing through it on the PS3 and a bit on the original PlayStation 4 . It 's one of the first titles to get patched for the new console , an upgrade that adds an HDR mode and general improvements to make it hit 60 frames per second more consistently . While that might not sound very exciting , it means there 's a much bigger visual change here than a mere resolution bump . On supported TVs , HDR leads to higher contrast , greater color definition and much deeper blacks than we 're used to . The Last of Us : Remastered is already an incredible-looking game , but the addition of HDR breathes new life into its environments . You can pick out more depth in the clouds and post-apocalyptic fauna , and pointing the camera at the sun makes it seem almost eye-searingly bright . It 's a good change , for the most part , though it sometimes made environments seem artificially oversaturated with color . I did n't really notice much of an overall performance upgrade either , but there might be some evidence of that later in the game . On my 1080p plasma TV , I did n't notice any difference playing the game on the PS4 Pro versus the original console . Sony is leaving it up to developers to figure out ways to tap into the PS4 Pro's power . For the most part , devs will include some combination of rendering games at a higher resolution than 1080p , packing in more visual effects and delivering a smoother overall experience . As I 've reported before , most PS4 Pro titles wo n't render natively at 4K , though that 's not something you should get too hung up on . Running at something like 1440p ( 2K ) with more graphical bells and whistles should still lead to much better-looking games than on the original PS4 . Wisely too , Sony is n't allowing developers to charge for PS4 Pro support . Infamous Second Son lets you choose between playing in a higher resolution than 1080p or getting better overall performance . And I quickly noticed that I 'd much rather have the game running at higher frame rates . Smoother gameplay suited Infamous ' s fast , action-heavy setup more than a resolution bump . Unfortunately , though , the game also seemed to slow down quite a bit whenever I tried to play in the higher-resolution mode . You 'll have a similar set of choices in Rise of the Tomb Raider . You can either have it run at higher frame rates in 1080p ; get more visual effects at 1080p and 30 fps ; or run the game in 4K at 30 frames per second . Again I leaned toward the non-4K options . What most impressed me was that the game looked like I was running it off of a PC , no matter which mode I chose . Tomb Raide r's HDR support in some ways made it seem even more impressive than on PCs . The environments simply "" popped "" a bit more ; things like the sun bouncing off snow and flames throughout the game seemed realistically bright , and character models were lit more dramatically . When it comes to PlayStation VR , the PS4 Pro has even more potential to be useful . VR is the sort of thing where any hardware upgrade could improve your experience considerably . I was able to test out the console only in Sony's PlayStation VR Worlds , but I noticed that the environments and characters were all sharper , and frame rates seemed generally smoother . It did n't seem to improve head and hand tracking much , but the upgrades make PSVR seem like a more viable competitor to PC-powered VR moving forward . One peculiar issue : You ca n't run PlayStation 4 Pro games in HDR while the PSVR is connected . Sony's VR system relies on a passthrough box that apparently ca n't handle an HDR signal . That could be a huge inconvenience to many gamers , since it means you 'll probably have to constantly connect and disconnect the PS VR box whenever you 're using it . While Sony is also positioning the PlayStation 4 Pro as something players with 1080p sets can enjoy , it does n't seem worth an upgrade for those consumers yet . You 'll notice the better graphics in games like Rise of the Tomb Raider , but you wo n't see any of the HDR benefits . And I just have a hard time recommending a $ 400 upgrade for minor performance improvements . If you 're a 1080p TV owner who plans to upgrade to 4K eventually , it 's still worth waiting on the PS4 Pro , since it 'll probably be cheaper by the time you get a new TV . 4K media So how do you get 4K video content when there 's no 4K Blu-ray player on the PlayStation 4 Pro ? For now , mainly through Netflix and YouTube . Sony said it 's pinning its hopes on 4K streaming taking off in the future , though , strangely enough , it has n't yet announced plans to bring the technology to the PlayStation Store . The company recently launched a 4K streaming store for its latest Bravia TVs , but I would n't be surprised to see that reach the PS4 Pro eventually . Both Amazon and Vudu also have healthy libraries of 4K content , but they have n't yet upgraded their apps for the PS4 Pro . The competition There 's no doubt about it : The PS4 Pro's greatest competitor right now is ... the PlayStation 4 . You might be able to find a decent discount on the original model , and I would n't be surprised to see the Slim discounted for Black Friday . At normal pricing , though , the PS4 Pro is only $ 100 more than the PS4 Slim . It makes sense to pay a bit more now to future-proof your investment , rather than just settle for an underpowered console you might end up replacing sooner . Complicating things even further , Sony has also enabled HDR on all PlayStation 4 models , which makes it less of a must-have feature for the Pro . Honestly , the PS4 Pro does n't really have direct competition until Microsoft's next-gen "" Project Scorpio "" console debuts next year . That system will have an even more powerful 6-teraflop GPU , which could potentially allow developers to reach 4K more easily . Still , it 's hard to get too excited for Scorpio until we know more about it . You might also consider a decent gaming PC instead of the PS4 Pro , but you 'll probably have to spend closer to $ 700 to get something that can handle today's games . And of course , you 'll be out of luck if you 're interested in Sony's exclusives . But if you can afford it and you care about graphics quality , a PC will deliver the best gaming experience . Wrap-up So who is the PlayStation 4 Pro actually meant for ? After testing it out for the past week , I 'd say it 's for people who have n't yet bought a PS4 and want to show off their fancy new 4K / HDR sets . And of course , there are the hardcore gamers who will snap up any piece of hardware that promises to be faster . Most consumers are better off waiting until more games get patched for the new system , and until Sony figures out its 4K media strategy . Devindra has been obsessed with technology for as long as he can remember -- starting with the first time he ever glimpsed an NES . He spent several years fixing other people's computers before he started down the treacherous path of writing about technology . Mission accomplished ?"	5

1155	"School Choice – An Educational Custom Fit Imagine if only one size of pants were sold in stores and government regulations would n't allow any other size to be made available to consumers . This may sound crazy but it 's much like what 's happening with the education of our nation's children . As Americans we enjoy a wide range of personal choice , and thankfully it includes our ability to select the pants that fit us best . But think for a moment about traditional public education . For decades the public school system has offered a one size fits all approach to educating our nation's children . As we approached the 21 st century , the public school system began to show its age . More and more children began to fall behind in a rapidly changing environment marked by the introduction of personal computers and later the internet . Sensing a need for change , many people began to push for new educational models that would keep up with the times . This marked the beginning of the school choice movement . Both charter schools and school voucher programs are collectively referred to as "" school choice "" initiatives , in that they allow parents freedom to choose individualized education options for their children that are outside of the traditional "" one size fits all ' public school system . A school voucher program provides parents with certificates that are used to pay for education at a school of their choice , rather than the public school to which they are assigned . Charter schools on the other hand are publicly funded schools that have been freed from inefficient public school system rules and regulations in exchange for accountability to produce positive , measurable results . These agreed to results are set forth in each school's charter . The ability for parents to choose an education path that is best for their children is an exciting opportunity currently revolutionizing public education . Considering the importance of public education , it 's understandable that many people would be hesitant to make changes to the system . Those opposed to school choice site concerns that public schools would be traded in for profit based education corporations that care more for financial profit than the individual education of students . Others site concern for what appears to be government sponsorship of private religious schools through the funding provided by various school voucher programs . Those against choice should be commended for demonstrating a committed concern for the education of our nation's children , but the overwhelming evidence proves that school choice is the right direction for the future . A characteristic of privately operated charter schools is the focus on success through measurable achievement and accountability . Imagine again the one size fits all pants store , how could they stay in business if another store offered various sizes and styles ? Simple , they could n't , not when faced with competition that provides a better choice for consumers . The traditional public school system of the past had no competition . There was no incentive to improve the quality of education they provided since there was nothing to measure it against . The school choice movement for the first time introduced an alternative to poorly performing public schools . Charter schools make a commitment , or charter , to achieve a measurable level of educational performance within a defined period of time . This concept works and has produced results in places like Chicago , where charter schools show better performance in ACT test scores , high school graduation rates , and greater numbers of students continuing on to college ( Rand ) . One group that benefits greatly from school choice is the urban poor . For decades there has been school choice for families that could afford it . The wealthy have always provided very expensive private schools for their children , and middleclass families with the resources have moved to neighborhoods that offered the best schools . But the poor , often in urban areas , have had no other option than to send their children to under performing and sometimes even dangerous public schools . Through school choice initiatives poor families have been given the same opportunities to send their children to safer and better performing schools which others have enjoyed for many years . In addition to the urban poor , other often overlooked groups can greatly benefit from a system that allows individual schools to focus on gifted , special education , or teen pregnancy programs ( Chub ) . It 's clear that choices in schools allow a custom fit of education solutions for every type of student . School choice represents change and there will always be those that resist change stand to gain from a return to the old system . One of the most active opponents to school choice is the National Education Association . Representing public education professionals , the NEA is the largest labor union in the US and boasts over 3.2 million members ( NEA ) . The NEA benefits from keeping status quo and exercising strong political power . At stake are changes in job performance accountability , and the loss of union jobs a result of non-unionized schools . The positions the NEA has taken on other issues have often been criticized as favoring the labor interests of its members rather than what 's best for students . One of the programs the NEA has been most vocal against has been school vouchers , contending that vouchers amount to government funding of religious based schools . On the contrary , citizens are allowed to retain a portion of their tax dollars that would have been spent on local public school funding and apply it to a school of their choosing . It is the citizen , not the government that selects and contributes to a private school whether it is religiously based or not . Consider families that are already sending children to private schools , they must pay the private school tuition and in addition to the tax burden for a public school they are not even attending . This double burden is unfair and amounts to a government fine for families that pursue private education without the help of vouchers . It 's clear that the historical one size fits all approach to education is outdated . The new fast pace of the digital age demands that we act quickly and accurately in guiding our public education policies . Cling to an antiquated system that provides poor results is a guarantee that traditional public education will continue to produce nothing other than poor results . Instead , a path of measurable results and accountability should be pursued . The arguments of those against school choice must be seen for what they are , and that is nothing more than protection of special interests such as big unions . Our nation must ensure that children will be provided with a choice based education that is forward thinking , customized , fair to all citizens , and able to move into the future with them ."	0

1291	"Brainstorming Software : Ideafisher Morphs Into Thoughtoffice ThoughtOffice is latest step in the evolution of business creativity solutions that began with IdeaFisher . Portland , OR , ( PRAvenueNW ) -- IdeaFisher came first . It caused quite a stir when it was introduced years ago as a way to bring brainstorming to the personal computer . ThoughtOffice is latest step in the evolution of business creativity solutions that began with IdeaFisher . It adds to Marsh Fisher's original vision a multimedia and web-savvy approach to computerized brainstorming . Marsh may not have fully anticipated the Internet but he saw the possibilities brainstorming software would unleash to creatives worldwide . As far back as the 1970s , Fisher , the founder of Century 21 , began looking for a computer software solution to the challenge of streamlining and improving the brainstorming process . Released in 1988 to critical acclaim , Fisher's breakthrough IdeaFisher ( http://www.thoughtoffice.com ) software quickly became the leading program in its category worldwide . ThoughtOffice , the pedigreed successor to IdeaFisher , was given its present name by Mark Effinger , an innovative "" multrepreneur , "" who developed around Marsh Fisher's program with the express purpose of adapting it to the new circumstances now at work in a computer environment shaped by the innovations of the Internet Age . Effinger added new features and functions to Marsh Fisher's principles and brought to it to market with access to the astonishing resources of the World Wide Web . ThoughtOffice not only built on the platform introduced by IdeaFisher but combined it with other creativity tools such as mindmapping and visual outlining ( http://thoughtoffice.com/blog/?page_id=355 ) . According to Chuck Frey , founder of www.InnovationTools.com , "" ThoughtOffice will help you to take your creative problem-solving skills to the next level . "" Frey adds , "" ThoughtOffice does a great job of leveraging the power of associative thinking ( http://thoughtoffice.com/blog/?page_id=325 ) . Using its rich , interconnected resources , you can follow a long trail of associations without running out of creative steam . Or you can follow a guided problem solving process to reveal fresh ideas and insights . In short , ThoughtOffice is like IdeaFisher on steroids . "" ThoughtOffice also makes ideas easy to understand and share with others -- employees , business associates , or clients -- whether in the same room , or across the web . Building on the original IdeaFisher process , one of the ThoughtOffice program's key functions is the IdeaBrowser , an exclusive brainstorming creativity engine that uses words , phrases , popular search engine phrases and images to help explore ideas quickly and easily . The program is integrated with ThoughtOffice , creating a hybrid of mind mapping and outlining capabilities in an easily accessible mini-browser that jump-starts the creative process . Frey also tells us , "" ThoughtOffice provides users with an unprecedented variety and volume of idea stimuli . It also succeeds in bringing together two different types of creative thinking ( http://www.thoughtoffice.com/?page_id=5 ) into one well-designed software program . Its question databases provide a solid foundation for left-brained , systematic problem definition , while its idea-generation tools serve as a catalyst to help the right half of your brain to make new associations and connections , which should lead to more breakthrough ideas . "" The ThoughtOffice programs , which range in price from $ 99 to $ 499 , address 17 distinct areas of expertise . What they have in common is the ability to harness the creative practices to productivity tools usually found only in separate programs . ThoughtOffice "" Bundles "" cover everything from Marketing and Advertising ( http://thoughtoffice.com/blog/?page_id=289 ) techniques to Effective Communication for live and written presentation . eXpertTopic Modules , which were developed with the use of a cadre of experts in creative fields , expand the core ThoughtOffice application and are targeted toward very specific Topics such as Conflict Resolution or Story & Screenplay Writing . The innovative successor to IdeaFisher works as an extension of the brain . Each is loaded with hundreds of questions that mine the subconscious for known and often-forgotten information -- and uncovers new connections through the kind of juxtaposition that lies at the heart of creativity . Advertising and PR consultant Martin Grossman ( http://marketingmatters.blogs.com/martin_grossman ) was early adopter of IdeaFisher and later a ThoughtOffice customer is convinced that ThoughtOffice is an indispensable tool for his practice . "" If creative types need to get their minds around a big , complicated project quickly , ThoughtOffice will help them do it faster and do it better , "" says Grossman . "" It 's the breakthrough in creativity software that people who think for a living have been waiting many years to see . "" About ThoughtOffice : ThoughtOffice Corporation was founded in 2005 as a solution to individuals and corporations needing to generate effective and creative ideas and innovations quickly and thoroughly .

1193	"The Hardest Part About Change is Taking Action BY KATHRYN MOTT I honestly do n't think that anyone out there really strives for mediocrity in every facet of their lives . There are some people that are content with their situation in life , but everyone has something they want to excel in ; something they want to be proud of . Unfortunately , most people do n't have the drive to do something about it . They waste away their time and talents day dreaming of what could be instead of living the life they want . People are constantly taking the easy road in life : it 's less risky , it does n't involve a lot of effort and it 's comfortable . Change requires you to step out of your comfort zone and into the unknown . You have to change yourself , your surroundings even your habits . Everyone has those moments in life where you look at where you are and the things you 've done to get there ; as a result , you 'll either be proud or disappointed . For those of you who have reached the point where you are wondering , "" how did I get here ? "" , there is still hope . Change is difficult . If it were easy , we would all be famous billionaires living in mansions . The fact that it 's hard is what makes change and improvement so great . Improving your life will result in several positive outcomes such as , giving you a better sense of self , making you a better person , mother father , friend , etc. and you 'll find yourself being happier in general . You need to understand that changing yourself for the better wo n't take away challenges in your life – it will just prepare you to be able to face them . If you have tried to change in the past and failed , do n't quit . You can still change and start making a difference in your life . The following tips will get you set on the path to action . When you do these things , you are preparing yourself to do more than just dream about the life you want ; you are getting yourself on the path to achieving it . Use these tips as guidelines to make the changes in your life that you want to see . The first step toward changing is knowing what you want to change and why . Take the time to sit down and write down your goals . Also write down why you want to change ; make this as in-depth as you can because it will be a foundation for you . This is something you will be able to go back to when you are feeling like it 's too hard or you have forgotten why it 's important . Tell people your goals . It can be embarrassing for some people to share with others what 's in their heart ; but it 's necessary . In order to change , you have to be held accountable . Letting someone else know what you are trying to do will ensure that you have someone to answer to . Make sure this person is someone who will continue to encourage you and is n't afraid to ask how things are moving along . Replace bad habits with good ones . Stopping something cold turkey is hard , so it 's best to replace the unwanted habit with something positive . If you have a major addiction , there are other steps you will have to take . If it 's just a bad habit , such as looking at Facebook too much , replace that with something like going for a walk around the block . If you are trying to stick within a budget , play a game with your family instead of going shopping . Find something positive to do that will replace the negative things in your life . Change is not easy , but it 's easier when you have someone to do it with . Find a partner , coach , friend or family member who might be in the same situation as you . If you want to start working out , set up times when the two of you can go exercise together . If you want to get up earlier , call each other in the morning and encourage one another to get up and get moving . Whatever changes you want to make , find a way to include someone else in them . You will be each other 's support , can hold one another accountable for what you do or do n't do . Get rid of distractions . There are things everywhere in our houses , our workplaces , and even our schools that can and will distract us from changing into the kind of people we want to be . Our phones , computers , iPads , etc. are all wonderful tools that we have at our disposal , but they can also hinder us . We spend so much time texting , emailing and checking various social media platforms . That is time that could be used doing something productive . Limit the amount of time you spend on the computer . Set an alarm and when it goes off , you 're done . Turn off the TV . I know so many people who have the TV on in the background while they are trying to get stuff done . I am guilty of this . In the past I would turn on a movie while I was trying to work or clean the house , but every time , I would find myself sitting on the couch watching instead of being up and moving . I decided to listen to audio books instead : that way I do n't have anything visual distracting me from the things I need to get done but I still have something entertaining or educational to listen to . Only say positive things to yourself . When you fail it 's easy to point out everything you did wrong , but that is so discouraging . Instead , say to yourself , "" I can do hard things . "" You have the ability to change , you just have to believe in yourself . Do n't beat yourself down . Serve other people . It 's funny how service works : you go out expecting to help someone else in need and you end up helping yourself . When you serve others , you feel better about yourself , you make a difference in someone's life , and you give back to the community . Recognize the good things you do , no matter how small . Many people might skip this step because it feels arrogant and prideful . IT 'S NOT ! Changing yourself is about evaluating where you are in life , what you 're doing and why you 're doing those things . When you make a change , even if it 's something simple , acknowledge it , do n't brush it off like it does n't mean anything . It means everything ! It means that you 're actually doing it , you 're changing . Reading is good for the soul ( and your mind ) , butway too many people get caught in the trap of consistently reading and never taking action on anything they read : How to Actually Take Action on All That Reading"	7
1549	When sitting down with your solicitor for the first time talking about your claim take into account what they are saying and make sure you fully understand what they mean , they eventually should ask you if you have any questions and it is extremely important not to say ' no ' . These are several questions that definitely need to be asked to help you fully understand your claim : What 's the deal with any passengers ? Passengers are not liable to pay out any damages as they are not personally driving the car and can not be at fault . However they can claim against people who have hit them whilst in a car even if they are just the passenger . The compensation for the passenger may be decreased due to several factors , the compensation will definitely be decreased if they are found not to be wearing a seatbelt when the accident took place , another reason as to why a passengers claim maybe reduced is the knowledge that the driver was in fact intoxicated by substance if this is known by the passenger then subsequently money will be taken off . A lot of accidents can now be assessed for free and some solicitors offer a no win no fee basis , so no matter how small an accident , if you were hurt in any way it is important to looking into car accident claims .

13	"Japanese Lessons for China's Currency SHANGHAI – The question of how much China's currency should appreciate to rebalance its trade has become a global hot-button issue . But the answers have been all over the map , with some finding that the yuan is not undervalued at all , while others argue that it should appreciate against the dollar by more than 30 % . Clearly , there must be major differences in the macroeconomic models used to produce such a wide range of estimates . But the one thing about which everyone seems to agree is the theoretically and empirically unjustified assumption that an equilibrium exchange rate actually exists . The theoretical problem is simple : a country's trade balance depends on a lot more than the value of its currency in the foreign exchange markets . Interest rates , employment , aggregate demand , and technological and institutional innovation all play a role . As the economist Joan Robinson pointed out in 1947 , just about any exchange rate will be the equilibrium value for some combination of these other variables . The equilibrium exchange rate , she famously argued , is a chimera . Not surprisingly , the empirical evidence that trade imbalances can be resolved through exchange rate changes alone is unconvincing . In the case of China , the most useful precedent is probably that of Japan in the period from the end of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange-rate regime in August , 1971 , to the collapse of its "" bubble economy "" in 1990 . During that period , the yen's value more than doubled against the dollar , rising from its original fixed rate of 360 to 144 at the end of 1989 . Yet , even as Japan's exports became much more expensive in dollar terms and its imports much cheaper in yen , its trade surplus rose from $ 6 billion in 1971 to $ 80 billion in 1989 . For two decades , expectations that an appreciating yen would restore external balance were repeatedly disappointed . At the time of the December 1971 Smithsonian Agreement , 308 yen to the dollar was supposed to do the trick . Fourteen years later , during the Plaza Accord negotiations , the Japanese argued for an eventual level of 200-210 , while some US Treasury officials thought the final target should be as high as 165-170 . At the end of the 1980's , some analysts thought rates as high as 120 might finally produce the long-sought equilibrium . Yet , as Japan entered the "" lost decade "" of the 1990's , its exports continued to grow faster than its imports . Japan's trade surplus peaked only in 1994 , at $ 144 billion , just a few months before the yen's April 1995 all-time high of 79.75 . In retrospect , it is easy to see why none of these supposed equilibrium exchange rates delivered external balance . As the yen appreciated , Japan responded not by exporting less but by improving productivity and quality control through plant and equipment investment and innovations in factory management , making possible rapid growth in exports of high-value-added products . Exchange-rate equilibrium calculations from the 1970's and 1980's , which could only have been based on the export sector's contemporary structure , naturally would have little relevance subsequently . The same is true of calculations at the beginning of the 1990's , which would have forecast Japanese import growth based on extrapolations from the high GDP growth rates of the previous 40 years rather than on the decade of stagnation that ensued . In China , changes in the export sector's structure similar to those observed in Japan are now taking place . These changes are likely to make today's attempts to find an equilibrium yuan-dollar exchange rate seem just as chimerical in hindsight as previous calculations of the yen-dollar equilibrium rate . For the 30 years since the beginning of China's economic reforms , Chinese industry has achieved impressive efficiency gains by adopting new technologies and realizing economies of scale , leading to a huge expansion in locally made products suitable for export . While an appreciating currency might eventually drive labor-intensive manufacturers out of business , if Japan's economic history is any guide , they are likely to be replaced by producers of things like ships , machine tools , semiconductors , and doubtless new products yet to be invented . The equilibrium yuan-dollar rate is a chimera not because China's trade could never be balanced , but because the exchange rate alone does not determine equilibrium . The structure of the entire economy matters , too . As this is constantly evolving in unpredictable ways , there is no reason to expect that the assumptions underlying any particular macroeconomic model will ever remain valid long enough for its steady-state solution to be achieved in practice ."	0

Ever since I 've "" jumped "" onto the Mentalism bandwagon , I 've realised just how hard it is . FYI , I did not jump on any bandwagon . That was a just a joke . Mentalism is something I really enjoy and have a passion for . It is very tough to do it right and I know I have a long way to go , but I 'm trying my best to get there eventually . I 've already lost track of the number of times I 've take risks doing mentalism for people and screwing up the effect . Thankfully most of these are to fellow members of my local magic society , so I 'm using this experience to learn and prepare myself for actual public performances . There are so many aspects I still need work on that sometimes I do wish I have a mentor helping me out .

233	"Agenda Children and armed conflict Report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) The meeting resumed at 3.15 p. m . The President ( spoke in French ) : I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter dated 14 January 2003 from the Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations , which will be issued as document S / 2003 / 45 , and which reads as follows . "" I have the honour to request that , in accordance with its previous practice , the Security Council invite the Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations to participate in the meeting of the Security Council being held today , Tuesday , 14 January 2003 , on children and armed conflict . "" I propose , with the consent of the Council , to invite the Permanent Observer of Palestine to participate in the debate , in accordance with the Council's provisional rules of procedure and with previous practice in this regard . There being no objection , it is so decided . I invite the Permanent Observer of Palestine to take the seat reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber . The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Greece . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Vassilakis ( Greece ) : As this is my first intervention before the Security Council this year , I would like to congratulate you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency . I would like also to extend my warm congratulations to the representatives of the new members of the Council , namely Angola , Chile , Germany , Pakistan and Spain . I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union . The acceding States – Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta , Poland , Slovakia and Slovenia – the countries of Central and Eastern Europe associated with the European Union – Bulgaria and Romania – as well as the European Free Trade Association country of the European Economic Area Iceland align themselves with this statement . It is a cruel fact that armed conflicts affect a large number of children in many parts of the world . Many of them are uprooted from their homes , maimed or killed . Others are orphaned , abused or exploited . Girls are especially at risk of being subjected to sexual violence during violent conflicts , including rape and enslavement . Children are recruited , trained and forced to kill . Malnutrition among children increases rapidly because of falling food production and displacement . Infant and child mortality rates rise dramatically . Access to schooling is seriously restricted . This means that the lives of generations of children growing up in conflict-affected areas are hampered in a multitude of ways that hinder their physical , social and emotional growth . We risk losing generations due to conflict . This is not only a human tragedy of immense proportions ; it is also a tragedy for the countries concerned . Those children are needed to ensure the continued development of their countries . We must face this challenge and ensure that we act as swiftly as possible . The European Union was satisfied that Security Council resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) clearly reflected the Secretary-General's concise report on children and armed conflict ( S / 2001 / 852 ) . The resolution is a valuable example of Council engagement in enhancing the rights of the child . The European Union calls on all parties to armed conflicts to respect international law relating to the rights and protection of children . Only by concerted international efforts can we ensure improved protection of the rights of the child . We also call on Member States to put an end to impunity for war crimes and other serious crimes perpetrated against children . Last February , the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict entered into force . The Optional Protocol constitutes a remarkable step forward in the international community's efforts to put an end to the recruitment of children into armed conflict . The European Union urges States that have not yet done so to ratify and implement the Optional Protocol . Another important step was the inclusion of a provision in the Statute of the International Criminal Court classifying the enlistment of children as a war crime . That covers both the conscription and enlistment of children under the age of 15 years into any kind of armed force or group and making them participate actively in hostilities . We urge all States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying and fully implementing the Statute . At the General Assembly special session on children , children told us that they wanted us to implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child . They are impatient , and for good reason : an enormous gap exists between the good intentions of international treaties and the real-life conditions of poverty , neglect and involvement in armed conflict . Millions of children worldwide are exploited . In spite of progress in some areas , much remains to be done . The European Union will seek in all appropriate forums to reinforce international action against recruiting and using children in armed conflict . We will focus on early warning of violations of children's rights , but we will also look at improving monitoring and rehabilitation activities of the United Nations at the regional , bilateral and local levels . Furthermore , we will insist on special protection for girls in armed conflict and on more effective measures to fight impunity . The European Union wishes to express its support for the work of the Office of the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict . The Office has done impressive work in raising worldwide awareness and mobilizing official and public support for the protection of children affected by armed conflict . We also recognize the importance of the work carried out by the United Nations Children's Fund , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights . It is also worth mentioning the United Nations Development Fund for Women and its report entitled "" Women , War and Peace "" . It is essential that the endeavours of those organizations receive adequate support from Member States – although it still remains the responsibility of Member States to implement all obligations flowing from international treaties and instruments . When discussing last year's resolution , the European Union welcomed the important tasks set out for the agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations . We believe that the funds and programmes , as part of their assistance programmes , can contribute significantly to promoting the rights and the protection of children , as well as to ensuring the rehabilitation of children affected by armed conflict . The needs of children in conflict situations are many . At the same time , we should recognize the unimaginable resources that children and young people possess even in the most difficult of circumstances . Apart from being victims , they also have the potential to contribute to reconciliation and conflict resolution . The European Union wants to welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General , and of the Council itself , to integrate the protection of children into the mandates of United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building operations . Including child protection staff in peacekeeping and peace-building operations is a promising new element . We would welcome a comprehensive assessment of the scope and effectiveness of the response of the United Nations , including recommendations for strengthening , mainstreaming and sustaining activities related to protecting children in armed conflict . The promotion of peace is the overriding responsibility of all countries , as well as of the Council . But as long as armed conflicts are a reality , we have a duty to promote the protection , as well as to defend the rights , of their most vulnerable victims : the children . The United Nations system as a whole has a strong role to play in this regard , and we owe it to the children of the world to mobilize its full potential . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Bahrain . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Saleh ( Bahrain ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : First , allow me to congratulate you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of January . I also congratulate your predecessor , the Permanent Representative of Colombia , on his presidency of the Council . I would further like to take this opportunity to express to all my best wishes for the new year and my hope that it will bring peace and security to all peoples . For several years , the Security Council has devoted part of its work to the consideration in public meetings of issues such as the protection of civilians in armed conflict , children and armed conflict and other questions . We welcome that trend in the Council , which allows non-members of the Council to take part in the discussions on such important issues . It enhances transparency in the Council and makes the Council more effective in dealing with international issues , especially those that might threaten international peace and security . There are two major reasons for focusing attention on children and emphasizing the need to protect them in armed conflict . The first is that children are part of civil society . Accordingly , they must be protected as stipulated by the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War . The second reason is that children are the most vulnerable sector of society and are therefore the sector in greatest need of protection and attention . Since the beginning of the Council's debate on children and armed conflict , in 1998 , the Council has adopted several resolutions and presidential statements on the protection of children in armed conflict , such as resolutions 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) and 1379 ( 2001 ) . The United Nations , through its various bodies and activities , has helped to strengthen the way in which certain international concerns on the issue of children in armed conflict are addressed , notably by making child protection a component of peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building missions . Despite all this , we still need to try harder to ensure the effective implementation of , and full compliance with , resolutions and international instruments concerning the protection of children . In that connection , my country would like to express the following concerns . First , when considering humanitarian issues such as the impact of armed conflict on children , we should try to be objective and credible and should try to avoid using double standards . It is absolutely necessary that the Security Council deal with the status of Palestinian children affected by the Israeli occupation of their territories . Secondly , it might be necessary during future consideration of this item to invite competent bodies such as the United Nations Children's Fund and the International Labour Organization to take part in the Council's deliberations in order to take advantage of their practical experience in this area . In that context , we welcome the participation of Ms. Carol Bellamy and her important statement on the issue . Thirdly , the Council should consider following up the resolutions it adopts , especially those on the issue now being considered , by adopting methods and means acceptable to members of the Council . Fourthly , it is also necessary to increase coordination and cooperation among the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council . Such coordination would increase the effectiveness of those organs when dealing with this issue of common interest . Coordination among them would prevent duplicating efforts and taking contradictory measures . The Security Council can play an essential role in the protection of children in armed conflict , especially through its peacekeeping missions . Likewise , the Economic and Social Council could play a primary role in post-conflict peace-building . As for the General Assembly , its principal role could be a legislative one , especially through the relevant international conventions and by making recommendations , in particular at its special sessions and other special events . Finally , we express our hope that the deliberations of the Security Council on children and armed conflict will evolve into a concrete , practical concern and that the Council resolutions will be applied on the ground with objectivity and without double standards . Recruitment of children , their sexual exploitation , the violation of their rights and the impact of foreign occupation on them are all considerations we should take into account in order to help them and to eliminate these phenomena . The Council plays an important role in this regard . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker on my list is the representative of Switzerland . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Staehelin ( Switzerland ) ( spoke in French ) : May I begin by congratulating France on assuming once again the presidency of the Security Council and wishing you and the new members of the Security Council every success in carrying out the tasks awaiting you . Switzerland welcomes this annual Security Council debate on children and armed conflict , as it represents one of my country's priorities in matters of human security . Switzerland takes note with satisfaction of the Secretary-General's report ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) and considers it to be a valuable reference document on action undertaken in the United Nations over the last year to respond to challenges with regard to the rights of the child in armed conflicts . I thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund for their respective presentations . Switzerland expresses with conviction its solidarity with the recommendations formulated by Austria on behalf of the Human Security Network and is convinced of the Security Council's essential role in their implementation . Switzerland reiterates its support for the international community's numerous current efforts to reinforce the protection of the civilian population in times of armed conflict . Children are particularly vulnerable , and the impact of conflict on their rights and well-being can be felt at many levels and in various ways : attacks on their rights to survival and development , attacks on their physical integrity , attacks on their rights to education and health , and the destruction of their family structures and of their social and community ties . Far too many of them also find themselves refugees or internally displaced , orphaned or unaccompanied . In the face of such situations , Switzerland particularly recalls the importance of respecting the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their two Additional Protocols of 1977 , in which specific provisions for the protection of and assistance to children are incorporated . As underlined in the Secretary-General's report , 2002 saw the entry into force of two major international instruments : the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts , and the Statute of the International Criminal Court . Switzerland , which ratified the Optional Protocol last June , is committed to pursuing its efforts with a view to ensuring its universal ratification as soon as possible . It hopes that all States that have not yet done this will follow its example by depositing a declaration , as stipulated in paragraph 2 of article 3 , indicating 18 years as the age limit for voluntary recruitment . The entry into force of the Rome Statute represents a major step towards an end to impunity . Switzerland welcomes the steps taken by the Secretary-General's Special Representative to ensure that the International Criminal Court , as well as the Special Tribunal for Sierra Leone , include particular considerations regarding juvenile law into their regulations and procedure . Switzerland shares the Secretary-General's opinion that the current major challenge resides in the implementation of these international instruments , which , by the standards they set , propose new prospects for action . In this respect , it would have been desirable for the report to formulate suggestions for concrete actions to be taken by the Security Council itself as well as by the United Nations system as a whole , and by each of its Member States individually . Switzerland emphasizes the innovative and welcome contribution that resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) represents , particularly the establishment of a list of parties to armed conflicts that recruit or use children in violation of the international provisions meant to protect them . The political importance of this list is undeniable , and it should certainly be maintained . However , its true value will become apparent only when the Security Council has defined the actions it plans to undertake in this respect . In this regard , Switzerland invites the Security Council to consider the following recommendations . We suggest that this list be updated on a regular basis . Include in the list all countries and situations of armed conflict which involve the problem of recruitment and use of child soldiers and which appear on the Security Council's agenda . Include on the list all other countries and conflict situations which the Council may deem necessary . Establish an ongoing dialogue with those Governments named in the list and promote the relevant instruments among the armed non-State actors . Identify other criteria , in addition to the recruitment and use of children , for developing the list , keeping in mind the magnitude of the impact of armed conflicts on children . At the conceptual level , the work accomplished by non-governmental organizations on this matter could constitute a particularly valuable contribution . To conclude , I wish to recall the commitments made by the international community in the document "" A world fit for children "" , adopted at the General Assembly's special session on children ( resolution S-27 / 2 ) . In this regard , Switzerland supports the activities to create awareness and to integrate children's rights in United Nations activities as a whole and encourages the Organization to pursue and intensify them at all levels . My country welcomes the implementation of guiding principles for conduct for all United Nations staff , which are essential to ensuring that the behaviour of humanitarian personnel vis-à-vis its beneficiaries is beyond reproach , and to prevent abuse . We further invite the Security Council to continue including child protection advisers in its peacekeeping operations . They play a key role in ensuring that the rights and specific needs of girls and boys be taken into account and respected . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the representative of Switzerland for the kind words addressed to my country . Mr. Laurin ( Canada ) ( spoke in French ) : First of all , I should like to thank you , Sir , for convening this open debate on children and armed conflict . ( spoke in English ) Given the present international context , and as we approach the one-year anniversary of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict , we are reminded that this is highly relevant work for the Security Council . I wish to begin by expressing my appreciation to the Secretary-General for his substantive report ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) . In particular , we were pleased to see specific conflict situations mentioned in the report as well as in the annex . What is clear is that , while progress has been made , the work of the Council is far from complete . Ongoing child abduction , conscription and the use of children in armed conflict make the work of the Security Council all the more urgent . We welcome the Security Council 's acting as a channel for Member States to receive information about the impact of conflict on children , and we would urge the Council in future to call for recommendations for effective solutions to prevent the recruitment and end the use of child soldiers . It is incumbent on us to move away from general statements to specific action and to build a system of accountability that can not be ignored . Now that Governments and armed groups using children in armed conflict have been publicly named , the challenge to the Security Council is to make these parties accountable . This requires genuine political will and resources . I congratulate the Secretary-General for highlighting this reality in his report . I would like also to congratulate the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , Mr. Otunnu , as well as the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) , in partnership with non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) and other United Nations agencies , for their efforts in developing mechanisms for integrating child protection into the peace and security agenda . I would like to pay special tribute to the critical work of civil society . We must continue to collaborate with those organizations that are on the front line of efforts to ensure effective monitoring and to meet the protection and assistance needs of war-affected children and their communities . In particular , Canada welcomed the report of the Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict in November of last year , funded in part by the Canadian Human Security Programme . That report illustrates clearly how much work still needs to be done with respect to monitoring , reporting and follow-up action before , during and after armed conflict . It goes without saying that Canada associates itself fully with the statement that the representative of Austria will make on behalf of the Human Security Network . Canada made commitments at the Winnipeg Conference , and we fully intend to respect them . For example , the Canadian International Development Agency has committed $ 122 million to child protection programmes and $ 2 million to child protection research , including several projects on war-affected children . Through our Human Security Programme , we sponsor youth outreach and education initiatives through War Child Canada , an organization that provides humanitarian assistance to war-affected children . We believe that the efforts of Canada and of others have helped turn the corner on monitoring and reporting . Now we would like to see action taken when the evidence is persuasive , as it is in the Secretary-General's report . To this end , Canada calls on the Security Council to undertake field missions in the specific conflict situations mentioned in the Secretary-General's report and in particular closely to scrutinize the action of the parties identified in the list annexed to the report . Such field missions should include consultations with local NGOs , women's organizations , youth groups and children . The Security Council should ask for a six-month interim report , evaluate progress made on these situations , and commit itself to follow up in one year's time on the parties named in this year's discussion . Ultimately , if there is no real progress , the Security Council must consider what actions it must take to give effect to its decisions , including targeted sanctions . At present , only countries on the Security Council's agenda are mentioned in the Secretary-General's report . This was a first step – one that should be followed by the inclusion of all conflicts in future reports . For the sake of the children who are the victims of such crimes , Canada believes this debate should be made an annual event . Recommendations from relevant resolutions , namely 1379 ( 2001 ) , 1261 ( 1999 ) and 1314 ( 2000 ) , should be assessed . In addition , Council accountability for specific actions to enhance protection and assistance for girls and boys affected by armed conflict and their communities could be reinforced . The issue of children and armed conflict is linked to the broader agenda item on protection of civilians recently debated by the Council . The Security Council and the broader United Nations system in its entirety must ensure that these agenda items remain linked . Although Council members agreed to consider the protection of civilians , including the rights and needs of children , in country-specific reports and resolutions , it would appear to us that this has not been done in every case . We call for renewed efforts towards this end . ( spoke in French ) Discussions on small arms , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration processes and access should address directly the implications for children and should pay special attention to the situation of the girl child . One promising outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects was its recognition of the impact of small arms on children . While this represents progress , children continue to fall victim to the ravages caused by the proliferation and reckless use of small arms . We commend the Economic Community of West African States for having launched its child protection unit within its secretariat . That is a very important initiative that we hope will serve as a model for other regional organizations in the integration of child protection into their work . We encourage United Nations agencies to continue their efforts to improve training on children's rights for United Nations staff and to evaluate lessons learned from incorporating child protection into peacekeeping operations . We believe that the six core principles of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Task Force on Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises should be incorporated into the mandate of all peacekeeping operations , including the prohibition of sexual activity with children . In addition , HIV / AIDS education and HIV testing and counselling services should be offered to all United Nations peacekeepers . Impunity , humanitarian access and physical protection , with specific consideration of sexual exploitation , all are urgent issues that remain unresolved , although they fall squarely within the Council's purview and should be addressed . Canadian representatives were pleased that very serious crimes committed against children , including the use of child soldiers to participate actively in hostilities , were included in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) . This was a significant development in international law to protect children from the devastating effects of armed conflict . The ICC is an important additional international mechanism to protect children's rights . We call on those States that have not yet done so to ratify or to accede to the ICC Statute . All States should welcome the fact that the ICC will contribute to ending impunity for serious crimes against children . In the outcome document of the special session on children , held in May 2002 , States renewed their commitment to strengthening the protection of children affected by armed conflict . The Security Council has a key role to play in ensuring that that commitment is translated into action . Canada firmly believes that all our actions must be guided by the principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which remains the principal instrument of reference and , indeed , the fundamental legislative basis for achieving children's rights . The primacy of the Convention needs to be strongly reflected in our words and actions aimed at improving the lives of children . The three landmark Security Council resolutions on children and armed conflict – 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) and 1379 ( 2001 ) – have outlined steps to be taken , actors to be engaged and mechanisms required to increase the protection of the rights of war-affected children and their communities . Progress has been made , but much more needs to be done . The Security Council has a key role to play . War-affected children have the right to expect that the Council will do its part to the fullest extent possible . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker on my list is the representative of the Philippines . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Manalo ( Philippines ) : At the outset , I wish to congratulate you , Sir , and your country on your chairmanship and leadership of the Council this month . I also wish to express my delegation's appreciation for this opportunity to speak on this important topic and to thank the Secretary-General for his report on this very important issue . We join others today in underscoring the need for continued and concerted actions at both the national and international levels to protect children in armed conflict . We thank the Secretary-General , the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) for their respective statements this morning . It is estimated that there are 300,000 child soldiers in the world , one fourth of whom are in the East Asia and Pacific region . Most of these children were forcibly recruited because of social and cultural pressures or were simply abducted outright . Poverty has also been a factor leading to child recruitment . Those not recruited or abducted have also been victims of displacement due to armed conflict . Instead of being in school , these children have served in the battleground , fighting , or as messengers and couriers , as cooks , spies or sex slaves . That these children have been and are involved in wars , growing up in an environment of destruction , denies the world a promising future . One of the most important milestones for protecting children from involvement in hostilities was set last February with the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict . It was indeed a positive step , a major step , and will hopefully end the use of children under 18 years old from serving as soldiers or directly participating in hostilities . The Philippines ratified the Optional Protocol last April , and it has also ratified the 1990 International Labour Organization Convention No. 182 concerning the elimination of the worst forms of child labour . We view these two international instruments as setting strict standards for preventing the recruitment of children as child soldiers . Children are also protected by the Philippines legal framework . Our Constitution provides that the State shall defend the rights of children and especially protect them from all forms of neglect , abuse and other conditions prejudicial to their development . In this regard , Philippines law provides that children shall not be recruited for fighting and that they should be given priority during evacuation as a result of armed conflict . In recognition of their special situation , children arrested for reasons related to armed conflict , whether as combatants , couriers , guides or spies , are entitled to release on recognizance within 24 hours to the custody of the Government or any responsible member of the community as determined by the courts . We welcome the fact that the Security Council has taken steps to address the matter of protection of and assistance to children in situations of armed conflict , particularly through resolutions 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) and 1379 ( 2001 ) . The Council must continue to be seized with this issue and take every opportunity to reaffirm its collective commitment to protect children and prevent their involvement in armed conflict by mainstreaming this concern in its relevant decisions . Post-conflict reconstruction programmes must also be tailored to assist children affected by armed conflict . In the case of girls and young women , who are often the targets of sexual abuse , abduction and forced recruitment , rehabilitation services are needed to deal with their experiences and assist them in reintegrating society . In the case of displaced children , aside from basic food , medical care and education , counselling and family reunification must be important components of their reintegration programme . For countries that have emerged from conflict , it is important that any disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme include the demobilization and rehabilitation of former child soldiers . Such programmes must distinguish the post-conflict needs of girl soldiers from those of their male counterparts . This will ensure that the provisions for demobilization and reintegration needs are directly related to the specific ways that children have been abused or traumatized during a conflict . The healing and reintegration of children affected by armed conflict should be a priority of any reconstruction effort and , as such , must be backed by sufficient resources . This is especially due to the necessity of finding alternative peaceful ways for children to develop and have a more meaningful future . Children are our future . We must all help to create a world fit for them . At the very least , we must protect them from the horrors of armed conflict . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker on my list is the representative of Monaco . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Boisson ( Monaco ) ( spoke in French ) : I am particularly pleased to see you , Sir , in the Security Council presidency this month , and to congratulate you . Once again , we come to the Security Council to plead a cause which affects the human being in his very nature , as well as in his future . The recruitment of children in armed conflicts is an intolerable and unacceptable violation of the rights of the child , a violation clearly condemned by the universal morality to which the States of our Organization adhere . Like many heads of delegation , the Chairman of the delegation of Monaco to the special session of the General Assembly on children , His Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert , last May referred to this painful issue , which , naturally and quite wisely , was fortunately taken into account in the very important final declaration adopted on that occasion . The Secretary-General's report of 26 November 2002 ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) had already alerted us to the difficulties which the Under-Secretary-General , Mr. Olara Otunnu , had encountered in carrying out his lofty mission , but also , we are pleased to see , to the undeniable progress achieved , which is extremely encouraging . This public meeting of the Security Council , in this first month of the year 2003 , under the French presidency , of which we appreciate both the initiative and quality , gives us the opportunity to express our unreserved support for the Secretary-General and his Special Representative , and the opportunity to encourage them to continue and strengthen their action in favour of this noble cause . As the principal organ under the United Nations Charter with responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security , the Security Council indeed urges us to undertake some soul-searching that should lead us to take decisive decisions in order to put an end to the painful situation of child soldiers . These are tragic and pathetic situations that , beyond the emotions they give rise to , undermine the principles of humanity on which our cooperation is built and on which rest our hopes and our deepest convictions . Using children as a tool of war , of suffering and death , is intolerable . This idea revolts and disturbs us . As a crime against children , a crime of genocide , a war crime , a crime against humanity , the use of children in armed conflicts makes it incumbent on the international community and the Security Council , which is its authorized voice , to embark on a new stage . The report of the Secretary-General and his message today , and the message that his Special Representative has just given us , as well as that of Ms. Carol Bellamy , Executive Director of UNICEF , emphasize the urgency and need for action . The Principality of Monaco , on the initiative of both its highest sovereign authorities and its people , has consistently put the protection of childhood , physical as well as moral , at the forefront of its concerns and national and international commitments . The public authorities have devoted many efforts to this . Many non-governmental organizations , with the support of the royal family , the Government and the parliament , are also making unflagging efforts to contribute to the protection of children in danger and the improvement of their plight , particularly when it is affected by poverty , violence and a destructive lack of a future . An international law symposium , which will be followed by a public meeting with civil society , is now being prepared in Monaco on the initiative of the World Association of Friends of Children ( AMADE ) . Effectively headed by Crown Prince Albert , who since May 1993 has chaired the Monaco delegation at the General Assembly sessions , and by Her Royal Highness Princess Caroline of Hanover , this initiative should make possible a better grasp of the concepts and the legal contexts involved nationally and internationally in the protection of children , as well as the ways of facilitating legal proceedings and strengthening sanctions in the case of serious , flagrant and repeated violations of their basic rights and fundamental freedoms . The symposium should contribute to increasing awareness , which is needed now more than ever on the global level , of this serious issue , given that we now have today – with the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the two Optional Protocols to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child – indispensable specific instruments to combat this ultimate form of barbarism that affects children . The Convention on the Rights of the Child , as well as its Optional Protocol on children in armed conflict – which the Principality has signed and ratified – and the very valuable experience gained by the international criminal tribunals will indeed be the basis for this exercise in reflection , as will the role of the International Criminal Court , which is awaited with great hope . This will involve , without academic disputes , trying to determine , in a realistic way , the most efficient legal and judicial ways and means to allow for prosecuting , beyond time and space , the most serious crimes against children . The report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict will also be , of course , at the heart of the symposium and the meeting with civil society . The Monaco authorities , which have contributed to the special fund for children involved in armed conflict since its inception , pay due tribute to the activities of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in this area . They greatly welcome the provisions that he advocates , given that they are without a doubt a decisive stage in the protection of children during armed conflict , internal as well as international , and regardless of the parties involved . In particular , we note with satisfaction the list of parties involved in conflicts contained in the report's annex – parties against which there is proof that they continue to recruit and arm minors and use them without restraint or caution in situations of extremely brutal hostilities . The resolution to be adopted at the initiative of France at the end of this exchange of views should grant all the necessary legitimacy and authority to its provisions to follow up specifically on the previous Security Council resolutions , in particular resolutions 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) and 1379 ( 2001 ) . Defining as a war crime by the Statute of the International Criminal Court of forced recruitment of children under the age of 15 in hostilities , including in internal conflicts , as well as attacks on hospitals and schools , or serious , repeated sexual violent acts , should help us . This definition is decisive insofar as the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity , of 26 November 1968 , explicitly stipulates in article I that war crimes and crimes against humanity are without statutory limitation , like genocide , which the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide , of 9 December 1948 , considers as a crime against the rights of nations , jus gentium , whether committed in time of peace or in time of war . I would recall furthermore that article VI of the Convention on genocide had already provided for an international penal tribunal as may have jurisdiction over such crimes , and article VII stipulated that such crimes would not be considered political for the purpose of extradition , which would also be agreed by the contracting parties in accordance with their laws and treaties in force . Article II ( c ) of this same instrument also considers – and this is noteworthy – that genocide also extends to an act of forced transfer of children from one national , ethnic , racial or religious group to another , committed with intent to destroy them . Today , as the Secretary-General stated in his report , the true challenge lies in the implementation and the effective application of existing international instruments and norms . However , it is undeniable and encouraging to note , undoubtedly for the first time in such a report , references to Governments , paramilitary organizations and armed groups that are guilty of kidnapping children and training them , despite their will , to become war criminals , murderers and torturers . We now know the perpetrators of these crimes , or at least some among them . We have the legal means to prosecute and punish them . Without a doubt , we must see to it that there is the political will to act and find the financial and law enforcement resources to intervene effectively . Undoubtedly also , we must strengthen the programmes for reinsertion of child soldiers and develop new ones , while seeing to it that these programmes become integral elements of any post-conflict reconstruction and development projects . The appointment of advisers in certain of the programmes under way seems to be bearing fruit and therefore is an interesting path to pursue and encourage . As the Secretary-General has also recalled , the creation during armed conflicts of protected zones in which women , children , the elderly , the wounded and the disarmed can find asylum and protection is one solution to impose . It is a solution that the highest authorities in Monaco have always wished to see encouraged and promoted by the United Nations . Such zones should benefit from secure access routes to allow for the intervention of humanitarian personnel . Ahmadou Kouroma , who has recounted his adventures as a child soldier in a very beautiful novel that received several literary prizes , clearly shows that reinsertion is always possible and often crowned with success . For , as this author wrote of his mother , "" after 30 years of suffering , smoke and tears , there was still something marvellous in the hollows of her face "" . The moving observation by this child , a criminal despite himself who found again his place in human society , should lead us to be optimistic and give us , with hope , the will to act that naturally follows from this . In that spirit of optimism and hope , we must have the courage of our convictions and take the necessary decisions in order to ensure that the recommendations of the Secretary-General are effectively followed up and his expectations fulfilled . The clear and unambiguous desire of the Government of the Principality is quite clear in this regard : justice must be done , and international law , which deals with this question extensively and in detail , must triumph so that the murderers of children are punished for their crime – the worst crime of all : turning children into criminals and transforming their innocence into barbarism . Here , we believe that there are three crucial elements . First , when internal judicial proceedings have been exhausted , or in cases where such proceedings have not been used , the competence of international bodies , in particular the International Criminal Court , should naturally come into play . Secondly , crimes and violations against girls and boys of less than 15 years of age should not be excluded from the criminal definitions contained in the Statute of the International Criminal Court as they relate to the crime of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , under articles 6 , 7 and 8 of the Statute respectively . Thirdly , it should be possible to apply , without reservation , the principles of the Convention on the Non-Applicability of the Statute of Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity of 26 November 1968 , as well as , when justified , those of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 9 December 1948 . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Rwanda . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Muvunyi ( Rwanda ) : We would like to congratulate you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of January and to extend our congratulations to the representatives of the new members of the Security Council – Angola , Chile , Germany , Pakistan and Spain . My delegation also wishes all the members of the Security Council a happy and prosperous new year for 2003 . The delegation of Rwanda welcomes this open debate on the sensitive issue of children and armed conflict . As a country emerging from genocide , Rwanda has a wide experience to share on this important topic of children and armed conflict . In Rwanda , children were killed by génocidaires , and survivors were traumatized by the violence , which left orphans in its wake . Rwanda believes that all children must go to school and that they must never again be involved in armed conflict . In the 1994 Rwanda genocide , children under 10 years old were used by génocidaires to hunt and to kill fellow children , adults and rape victims of the génocidaires . After the tragedy , children suspected of genocide were arrested , imprisoned in special prisons and re-educated . I would like to announce that this coming Friday , child suspects in prison will be released in accordance with the statement made by His Excellency President Paul Kagame of the Republic of Rwanda on the release of 40,000 suspects of genocide . Rwanda is totally committed to the protection of children and does not tolerate the abuse of children under any circumstances . The Rwandan delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict , document S / 2002 / 1299 . Rwanda hopes that action will be taken . We fully agree with the statement made by the Secretary-General in the Security Council this morning . We believe that sufficient funds must be spent on the education of children for development , instead of diverting financial resources to the destruction of human beings . Children are the hope of tomorrow ; that is why special attention should be given to our young children . Let us lead children to school and not to armed conflict . Let us take them school and ensure that there is follow-up so that they acquire appropriate skills , knowledge , education and discipline as future leaders of the world . The recruitment of children in armed conflict must be halted at all costs as a matter of urgency . Children must be able to grow in an environment of peace , and should never be involved in any armed conflict . That is why the Rwandan delegation condemns armed groups which enlist children under 18 years of age . It is dangerous to indoctrinate children with the ideologies of hatred and genocide with the final objective using them in fighting useless wars without a cause . Why use children in conflicts ? As we know , children naturally obey orders , even negative ones , such as the order to kill innocent people . Children will carry out any order in good faith because they do not differentiate between evil and the best things . The irrational warlords must understand why young children should not be brainwashed and become hostages of conflict . It is totally unacceptable to abuse children , and the Security Council must take a firm decision to reverse the current situation prevailing in some States Members of the United Nations . We call upon the Security Council and the international community to condemn the armed groups of the former Rwandan Army ( ex-FAR ) forces and Interahamwe , the Parti pour la liberation du peuple hutu , the Front pour la défense de la démocratie , the Conseil national pour la défense de la démocratie , the Mai-Mai and others mentioned in the annex of the report of the Secretary-General as currently using child soldiers in the Great Lakes region . My statement would be incomplete if I did not condemn those who rape children – as well as those who rape adults . Rape is one of the weapons used in armed conflicts , and children committed rape and were raped during the Rwanda genocide of 1994 . According to Rwandese law covering acts of genocide , adults who committed rape during the genocide are in the first category of génocidaires , who are given the death penalty . Infanticide must also be punished by the death penalty if we are to halt this crisis imposed on children . Let me emphasize that young children are the potential resources that can lift this world out of poverty and injustice and attain irreversible progress in accordance with the United Nations objective of achieving sustainable development . Children must therefore be freed from disease , hunger , slavery , corruption and conflict of all types . They must grow in an environment of love , peace and justice , with a thirst for appropriate knowledge and the skills to develop themselves . The whole world would thus harvest the fruits of such well-guided children . Those who are today involved in armed conflict must be demobilized without delay , and the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) must put in place strategies and procedures and must provide the means for their implementation . Let the Security Council join hands with UNICEF as the saviour of the children of States Members of the United Nations . Investing in the education of young souls is the priority of priorities . The authorities of the Republic of Rwanda are grateful to Ms. Carol Bellamy , Executive Director of UNICEF , and to Mr. Olara Otunnu , Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , for their assistance to Rwanda orphans and to the many children who after the genocide prematurely became leaders of families of other children . Rwanda has a clear vision : to invest in those children in order to achieve irreversible development . Finally , Rwanda requests and recommends that the President of the Security Council declare a universal ceasefire in favour of children in order to withdraw them from armed conflicts . This is not a favour , but a fundamental right for children who are caught up in armed conflict and who are held hostage in some areas of conflict . They must be handed over to UNICEF . Even liberation movements must transfer children to liberated areas or demilitarized zones . In the case of displaced persons , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the Red Cross and United Nations agencies must attach special importance to the welfare of children by providing them with appropriate feeding , vaccination , medicines and schooling . Demobilized children must go back to formal schooling and should be motivated by UNICEF , the United Nations Development Programme and international financial institutions . Failure to save the lives of children condemns the whole world to misery and long-term social injustice . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Ukraine . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Kuchinsky ( Ukraine ) : I would like to begin , Sir , by expressing appreciation for the manner in which you are presiding over the work of the Security Council and by taking this opportunity to welcome you as the Permanent Representative of France . I am confident that your profound experience and excellent diplomatic skills will contribute greatly to the Council's activities and to the United Nations as a whole . Let me also thank you and the delegation of France for convening this important meeting . Ukraine believes that the practice of holding Security Council open debates on children and armed conflict is a clear manifestation of the great significance of this issue . Security Council resolutions 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) and 1379 ( 2001 ) became a strong basis for advocacy on behalf of war-affected children . Various references to this issue have been made in a large number of other Security Council resolutions , presidential statements , briefings and open debates . All this testifies to the Council's involvement in this important matter and to the fact that the protection of children is a priority concern in the area of peace and security . We are pleased with the considerable progress made lately in the field of protection of children affected by armed conflict . The entry into force of two international instruments – the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) – which qualify crimes against children as war crimes , has become a milestone in strengthening and developing worldwide standards for the protection of children . I would like to express appreciation to the Secretary-General for his report on this issue ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) . For the first time , the report contains a list of parties to conflicts that continue to recruit and use children . Some 300,000 boys and girls are currently being exploited as child soldiers around the world . In our view , the publication of this list is yet another important step forward in our efforts to put an end to the impunity of those who disregard the rights of war-affected children . But it may not be enough just to condemn or prohibit the recruitment of children . We need to ask ourselves : why do children join armies ? If we are to prevent children from participating in the fighting , we need to understand specifically the causes that force children to become soldiers . Ukraine welcomes the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , Mr. Otunnu , and his Office aimed at creating , in cooperation with the Secretariat and the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) , guidelines for United Nations peacekeeping personnel to ensure that children's rights and needs are given proper attention and response during the peacemaking process . Peacekeeping missions have a crucial role to play in providing protection to children . In order to implement this particular dimension of their mandate , a child protection adviser should be responsible for coordinating activities to ensure the protection and welfare of children . We are especially appreciative of the fact that the first advisers of this kind have already been deployed in Sierra Leone , the Democratic Republic of the Congo and , recently , in Angola . Despite the progress achieved so far , much remains to be done to ensure the effective protection and rehabilitation of children in times of war . We should not forget the alarming fact that during the last decade of the past century the world lost some 2 million of its youngest lives as a direct result of armed conflicts . Another 6 million were injured , and over more than 10 million were traumatized . Today , more than 20 million children have been displaced within or outside their countries due to war . Every month , nearly 800 children are killed or crippled by landmines . There is no doubt that the effective monitoring of adherence to the provisions of international law and the consequent obligations , as well as to the commitments pledged by parties to conflict , are essential actions for ensuring the protection of children and their rights . In that regard , it is important to continue to include observations concerning the protection of children in reports to the Security Council on specific conflict situations . When designing peacekeeping operations , the Security Council , in our view , should make every effort to protect both children and their supportive environment : schools , hospitals , health centres and religious institutions . Ukraine strongly endorses the concept of children and their protective and nurturing institutions being considered as zones of peace . It is important also to focus on children in post-conflict reconciliation programmes . There is an urgent need for the international community to support programmes , including advocacy and social services , for the demobilization of child soldiers and their reintegration into the community . Such children should be offered new experiences that will change their identity from that of soldiers . Education and training remain fundamental to that end . In our view , more attention should also be given to greater involvement by women in peacekeeping missions . We believe that that would help to enhance the capacity of missions in terms of protecting girl children and dealing with gender-sensitive aspects . Finally , I wish to stress that the Secretary-General's report sets out an important agenda and a basis for future work by the Council and by other United Nations bodies . Ukraine looks forward to further progress in that direction and is prepared to contribute specifically to the subsequent consideration of the issue of children and armed conflict . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Egypt . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Atta ( Egypt ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : At the outset , on behalf of the Egyptian delegation , I should like to tell you , Sir , how grateful we are to your friendly country and to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month . We should also like to thank the Secretary-General , Mr. Kofi Annan , and his Special Representative , Mr. Olara Otunnu , for their tireless efforts and valuable contributions aimed at enhancing and protecting the rights of children in armed conflict , and we reaffirm our total support for those efforts . During the past two years , the Security Council has devoted considerable attention to children in armed conflict , playing its role in that sphere by taking decisions related to peace-building and peacekeeping operations and by asking the parties to conflict to respect international law , in particular with regard to the protection of children . That is commendable , and complements the General Assembly's primary responsibility for children's issues . In that connection , I should like to express our gratitude to Mr. Olara Otunnu for his efforts and to draw attention to the importance of his field visits to raise awareness , to promote and to strengthen the protection , rights and well-being of children affected by armed conflict . In his report ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , the Secretary-General says that Mr. Otunnu's visits had helped in the assessment of the situation of children in armed conflict , in making specific recommendations and in heightening the international community's awareness of the problems faced by children . In that regard , we reiterate our demand that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General visit children living under Israeli occupation in the occupied Palestinian territories and prepare a report on effective measures to help protect those children in implementation of the relevant provisions of the outcome of the General Assembly's May 2002 special session on children , as cited by the Assembly on 18 December 2002 in its resolution 57 / 190 . Palestinian children are not only suffering from occupation , with its devastating psychological consequences ; they are also deprived of their fundamental rights , including the right to live in security in a stable family environment . Not only are their families deprived of shelter and work ; their lives are threatened if they ask for their legitimate fundamental rights . The suffering of Palestinian children does not stop there : they are deprived of a future , because they are given no tools to improve their future . Palestinian schools have been closed , and Palestinian children can not continue their studies because of the constraints that have been imposed on them . The Secretary-General has stated that the cordoning off of the territories , the curfews , the barriers and the checkpoints give rise to humanitarian problems , which result in the deterioration of education . The suffering of Palestinian children has exceeded all limits : unless the situation improves , there is no hope for the short-term future . Therefore , Egypt urges all countries to help Palestinian children by ensuring their humanitarian and other basic needs . We invite the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to undertake a field visit to the region in order to raise awareness of the situation on the ground and to enable the international community to adopt effective necessary measures aimed at relieving the suffering of Palestinian children and ensuring their protection . Egypt supports all national and international efforts in the area of protecting the rights of children and improving their situation . We are firmly convinced that the economic , social , political and cultural progress of any society depends on the overall physical , moral , mental and educational development of its children . Over the past decade , the international community has undertaken many commendable efforts and has made great achievements in that area . Despite the success of the World Summit on Children , held in 1990 , and the setting of ambitious goals to help children , the world still witnesses a number of factors that have had a negative impact on children , such as the economic effects of debt , illness and epidemics . Recent years have witnessed a prevalence of armed conflict , a lack of respect for international law – especially international humanitarian law – and various violations of the rights of civilians . Hence , the problem of children in armed conflict – despite efforts to prevent their recruitment and to ensure their demobilization and reunification with their families , their protection from systematic violence and their psychological reintegration into their homes and communities . The Secretary-General's innovation in his report – the list of parties to conflict that are violating children's rights – is a commendable initiative that should be studied with a view to taking the necessary actions to track down those who violate the rights of children and bring them to justice . Within the framework of our commitment to work with the international community on issues pertaining to children in armed conflict , we urge that children be enabled to live in security and stability . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Austria . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Pfanzelter ( Austria ) : I have the honour to speak in Austria's capacity as current Chair of the Human Security Network , an interregional group of countries that also comprises Canada , Chile , Greece , Ireland , Jordan , Mali , the Netherlands , Norway , Slovenia , Switzerland and Thailand , and South Africa as an observer . Ever since the creation of the Human Security Network , in 1999 , the issue of children affected by armed conflict has been of critical importance to our agenda . The Network and its individual members have witnessed the origin of several important initiatives , such as the Agenda for War-Affected Children , adopted at the Winnipeg Conference in September 2000 ; the holding of workshops on the issue of ending the use of child soldiers in Jordan ; and the programmes of the Centre for Children Traumatized by Armed Conflicts in South-Eastern Europe , in Ljubljana , Slovenia , to name but a few . Austria made children and armed conflict one of the top priorities during its period in the chairmanship of the Network . At its next ministerial meeting in May this year in Graz , the Human Security Network is expected to adopt a common support strategy for children affected by armed conflict , identifying a set of operative principles as well as a training curriculum for child-rights monitors and rehabilitation experts . One of the results envisaged is that the Network will contribute to establishing a pool of child experts for eventual use in conflict areas . In November 2002 , the Human Security Network supported the holding here in New York of an international symposium on children affected by armed conflict . The event was organized by the Harvard Program on Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research , in cooperation with the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers , the Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict , the United Nations Children's Fund and the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General . The symposium focused on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) and came up with a set of concrete recommendations , which have been communicated to the members of the Council . Let me now touch upon the politically significant report of the Secretary-General before us . We strongly support the general thrust of this report and I would like to highlight a few of its aspects . It is indeed astonishing how the normative framework for the protection of children in armed conflict has been strengthened during the recent past . In less than a month , we will celebrate the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on children in armed conflict . While progress with regard to the normative framework for the protection of children in armed conflict is certainly remarkable , I would like to reinforce the call made by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to focus now on application . There is an essential role for the United Nations system in ensuring better implementation of the relevant standards , in the first place through an enhanced operationalization of activities in the field . Austria and the Office of the Special Representative are currently working together on a compendium containing all relevant international standards , which will be published shortly and is supposed to improve the understanding and knowledge of those dealing with children in armed conflict . Let me now come to the much anticipated list requested by Security Council resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) . The Human Security Network welcomes the list annexed to the report , as well as the description in the report of further situations of concern , which could not be added to the list due to formal reasons . This list is without doubt a major and politically significant contribution to raising awareness about the plight of children affected by armed conflict around the world and to eventually ending the recruitment of child soldiers . It also clearly demonstrates that the international community is no longer willing to close its eyes before one of the biggest tragedies we are facing today . While the annexed list candidly names 23 parties to armed conflict that recruit or use child soldiers and meet the other criteria set out in resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) , it is , however , obvious that it excludes large numbers of children equally affected by armed conflict . We therefore believe that the list needs to be extended . It should encompass all other situations where children are recruited or used as soldiers or where their protection needs are severely threatened in other ways . As an example , I would like to direct members' attention to one situation which is particularly alarming : the ongoing abduction of numerous boys and girls in northern Uganda . Based on reports from a variety of sources , we have reason to believe that large numbers of children are still being abducted and held by the Lord's Resistance Army for use in combat or as sex slaves . The Human Security Network is currently evaluating possible action to shed more light on this situation and to put a halt to this abominable practice . At the same time , we feel that it is necessary also for the Security Council to be able to better assess such situations . The Human Security Network has concrete recommendations to present to the Council which , in our view , would significantly increase the ability of this forum to address the issue of children and armed conflict and will have an impact on the lives of war-affected children . The 10 recommendations can be summarized as follows . We should continue the consideration of the issue of children and armed conflict on a regular basis and adopt new resolutions adding value to the debate . We should create an effective evaluation mechanism for the list of parties to conflict recruiting or using child soldiers and the relevant steps taken by those on it . This could include field visits . The involvement of international agencies and non-governmental organizations in this process is crucial . The Secretary-General should be requested to regularly update this list and consider extending it by also including conflict situations not on the Council's agenda , as well as other severe violations of relevant child-protection obligations , such as abductions or the use of landmines . We should enter into a dialogue with the Governments of countries on the list , ask them to report on the respective situations and urge them to put an immediate end to the recruitment or use of child soldiers , to reintegrate them into society and to stop all other severe violations of child-protection obligations . We must also raise awareness among all parties concerned , including non-State actors , of their obligations and responsibilities under international humanitarian , human rights , refugee and criminal law . We should ensure that the issue of children affected by armed conflict is also taken up under other agenda items of the Council , in particular when considering resolutions on specific conflict situations or when planning Security Council missions . According to a study by the Watchlist , only 9 out of 75 country-specific Security Council resolutions adopted between August 2000 and October 2002 included references to children and armed conflict . Attention must also be paid to the need for all peace processes ; all disarmament , demobilization and reintegration processes ; and all justice and reconciliation mechanisms to be child-conscious and for boys and girls to be fully involved in order to make sure that their voices are heard . The child-focused expertise in these processes should be increased and the training of peacekeeping , civilian police and humanitarian personnel on child protection standards promoted . Each peacekeeping operation should include at least one child protection expert . The establishment of rosters of qualified experts available should be encouraged . We should give higher priority to the issues of violence against , trafficking in and exploitation of children , in particular girls , and to the prevention of infectious and sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS , and request the provision of adequate assistance to the children affected . The Human Security Network also suggests that efforts be made to ensure safe and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for children in emergencies , with emphasis on particularly vulnerable groups such as displaced and separated children . Finally , the Network suggests improving the exchange of information with non-members , international agencies and NGOs on the issue of children affected by armed conflict and the establishment a focal point for that purpose . In conclusion , let me assure the Council that the members of the Human Security Network remain fully committed to enhancing the protection of children in armed conflict . This is indeed an urgent matter pertaining to our common values and our conscience as human beings . The President ( spoke in French ) : I would like to inform the Council that there are 17 speakers remaining on my list . I intend , with the cooperation of the participants , to exhaust the entire list this afternoon . The next speaker is the representative of Nepal . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Sharma ( Nepal ) : I wish to begin by extending to you , Mr. President , and the other members of the Security Council warm , although belated , wishes for a happy new year . Let me also say how delighted my delegation is to see you so ably presiding over the Council . Children , the weakest sector of a population , suffer in many ways in situations of armed conflict . They lose their parents and other loved ones . They lose their homes and livelihoods . They lose basic services such as education and health . And they even lose their lives . Those who survive are often forced to live in camps and or in confinement as refugees or displaced persons and become susceptible to exploitation and temptations . The most horrendous crime that the parties to a deadly conflict commit is to use child soldiers . This robs children of their childhood and innocence and places them in a world of murder and mayhem . Traumatized and stigmatized , such children have difficulty coping with normal life and blossoming to their full potential . We have internationally agreed safeguards for the protection of children , but they remain ineffective in delivering results . The Convention on the Rights of the Child and its relevant Optional Protocol , Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions and Convention No. 182 of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) set basic international standards for the protection of children . They are complemented by a number of other compacts , conventions and resolutions . The International Criminal Court is certainly another potent instrument to protect children in armed conflict . Despite those provisions , children continue to face misery , exploitation and death in conflicts . The world community faces a daunting challenge : to stringently enforce those provisions . Part of the problem is due to the fact that world community has been incoherent in its response to conflict . Political considerations get in the way of devising a cogent and seamless set of actions . More often than not , funding has failed international compacts , whose vision loses focus along the trail of implementation . Critical is the imperative to ensure that the perpetrators of violence against children do not go unpunished . Crimes against children should not only be excluded from amnesty ; they should also carry heavier punishments . Special measures , including punishment , are essential to protect girl children . The nature of , and potential damage from , a conflict should determine the priority and extent of the international community's response . Clearing landmines should be undertaken with a sense of urgency , and should receive adequate funding . Resolute political will must be demonstrated to ensure effective control of small arms , which maim and kill most children . Collective efforts should be strengthened to prevent fuelling conflicts with proceeds from the exploitation of natural resources , drug trafficking and other criminal activities . Juvenile justice should constitute an important part of domestic courts and of international tribunals and courts to try child soldiers who might have committed grave crimes . A comprehensive programme should be put in place to demobilize child soldiers , as well as to give them skills and to rehabilitate them and reintegrate them into their communities . While a tailor-made response is essential to resolve disputes and prevent conflicts , we must also look at the larger picture and remove the causes or aggravating factors of conflicts . This calls for eradicating poverty and promoting sustainable development , as well as advancing justice and human rights around the world . In 9 out of 10 cases , non-State actors have been committing the horrendous crime of recruiting and deploying children as combatants with impunity . Changing the culture of impunity demands a fresh outlook as well as strengthened mechanisms and measures from the world community . Let me share a glaring example from my own country . As the Secretary-General has mentioned in the report before the Council ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , children are being subjected to forced and involuntary recruitment by the Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) . Indeed the Maoists , who are seeking to remove the constitutional monarchy and who are undermining democratic values and institutions , have turned children into sacrificial lambs in their brutal pursuit of political power . Yesterday , the Maoists reportedly abducted 80 children from a school . The other day they took 150 children from school at gunpoint . These children are forced to undergo combat training . They are often used as human shields in attacks . This is something the rebels have been doing on a regular basis . Young girls have become the principal targets of abduction by the Maoists , who are reportedly striving to induct more women into their guerrilla force . Families that do not consent to giving their children away face the direst consequences . This terror has set back the clock of progress in Nepal , a least developed country that was taking determined steps towards modernization . The Maoists are destroying schools and health posts , bridges and communication towers . They have also been killing teachers and political workers . Consequently , children are deprived of education and health services . The movement of people and trade have been impaired and tourism has dwindled . Villages have lost young men and women , as they flee their homes to escape Maoist atrocities and conscription . Development activities in rural areas have ground to a halt . Nepal has been trying its best to find a peaceful settlement to the problem . Only recently , His Majesty the King has appealed to all political forces to find a peaceful solution to the country's political problems and to engage the country's resources and energy in promoting development and prosperity for the common people . The Prime Minister has also called on the Maoists to come to the negotiating table and has promised to create the necessary environment for talks to begin . Given their trail of deception , their attitude towards negotiation – treating it as a tactical step to destroy the enemy rather than as a strategic framework for a peaceful resolution of conflict – and their confusing and often contradictory statements , the Maoists are yet to emerge as a credible partner for peace . Still , the Government is willing and eager to talk to stop the wanton bloodletting so that the nation can pursue the path of peace and progress with total dedication and commitment . Nepal is committed to protecting children in armed conflict . We have no child soldiers in our security forces . But we are profoundly distressed by the fact that the Maoists have been abusing our children , stifling their development and darkening their future . While bringing Maoists to justice for their crimes remains our obligation , we have instituted a programme to rehabilitate and reintegrate children who have escaped the Maoist trap . We will need the international community's financial and technical support in our endeavour . Central to that is the United Nations , whose remarkable work we commend . Our appreciation goes to the front-line agencies of the United Nations , including the United Nations Children's Fund , the United Nations Development Programme and others , for their work to protect children and promote their interests . We urge the Security Council to remain seized of situations under its consideration and to remain vigilant about others so that international peace and security are not jeopardized . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the Representative of Nepal for the kind words he addressed to my delegation . The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Israel . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Mekel ( Israel ) : At the outset , I would like to extend my congratulations to you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency for the month of January . Since this is my first statement before the Council , allow me to say that I look forward to a productive working relationship with you and with all the other members of the Council . Israel is pleased to be participating once again in the debate on this item . Of the wide range of issues on the Council's agenda , those affecting the well-being of children are among the most heartbreaking . The images , reports and statistics documenting the plight of children in areas of armed conflict paint a truly horrific picture . And it is precisely that horror that compels us to take action . The most recent report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) contains a review of the progress made in implementing Security Council resolutions and other international instruments , as well as recommendations and observations aimed at achieving more widespread conformity with international norms . We welcome the report's general focus on the horrific practice of using children as soldiers . Children should be kept safe in school , not in harm's way on the battlefield . Instead , too many children are recruited to fight as soldiers in wars they did not start and are forced to give up their childhoods and often their lives in the perpetuation of destructive conflicts . These offences have long disturbed our moral sensibilities . Israel totally rejects the practice of using children as soldiers . We remain committed to eradicating this horrific practice and to improving more generally the situation of all children affected by armed conflict . Israel also supports efforts to increase awareness of the effects of armed conflict on children and to take children into greater consideration when addressing related issues , including terrorism and peacekeeping operations . Israel further welcomes the report's specific focus on those parties to an armed conflict that have failed to live up to their obligations by recruiting or using child soldiers . Our ability to make genuine progress will depend not only on focusing on areas in which progress has been made but also on areas in which it has not . Obviously , the formal practice of the forced conscription of children is abhorrent and must be outlawed and condemned . But the participation of children in conflict is not limited to formal military service . Children have also been recruited for roving militias , armed gangs and terrorist groups . In our region , children have been recruited and used by terrorist organizations as human shields , for the placing of explosives , as gunmen and even as suicide bombers , and it is regrettable that the Secretary-General's report does not mention this reprehensible tactic . Moreover , children have been educated to revere and emulate fighters and terrorists . In our region , we are faced with the disturbing phenomenon of children's television programmes that encourage youngsters to abandon their studies and sacrifice their lives in acts of war and terrorism . The subtler but no less repugnant indoctrination of children to hatred and violence , through official media , educational and religious institutions and other means , must also be the focus of widespread condemnation . Hatred and violence are learned behaviours . No child is born wanting to hate or kill . If we are ever to achieve the state of global peace that is the central objective of the Organization , we must ensure that we are educating the next generation in the values of tolerance , coexistence and non-violence . In our region , children have suffered terribly from decades of conflict and from the constant threat of terrorism . The Middle East has endured more than its share of wars that have left scars on all people in the region , but particularly on children . Israel has therefore supported international initiatives aimed at protecting children from the devastation of armed conflict , including the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child , as well as the Convention's Optional Protocols , to which we became a signatory last year . Israel's accession to the Convention was followed by the adoption of its Basic Law : Human Dignity and Liberty , a law that ensured that rights of the child were guaranteed constitutional protection . The adoption of that law sparked a flurry of judicial and legislative activity that broadened and extended Israeli society's commitment to the principles of the Convention . Unfortunately , broad commitment to those principles , while reflected in the rhetoric of many delegations , is too often not matched in practice . There remain delegations that are quick to unite under the banner of protecting children from armed conflict , but whose actions betray their true political motives . Those delegations are far too willing to sacrifice genuine progress on these issues in favour of their political agenda . In its most recent session , the General Assembly adopted a resolution pertaining specifically to the situation facing Palestinian children . With the adoption of that resolution , the Assembly has brought to three the number of resolutions on the human rights of children : one regarding the rights of the child , one regarding girls and one regarding Palestinian children . The latter is the only resolution adopted with respect to one specific group of children . There is , for instance , no resolution adopted concerning the five specific problematic areas cited by the Secretary-General in his report . While Palestinian children are undoubtedly deserving of protection , one may ask whether the 106 Israeli children killed and the many Israeli children wounded by terrorism since September 2000 , or the children in Africa or in parts of the Arab world are any less deserving . Notwithstanding the questionable wisdom of adopting particularized resolutions on issues of universal concern , it is a grave shame that those who supported that one-sided resolution were unable to rise above narrow their political agenda and call for the protection of both Israeli and Palestinian children alike . We would urge responsible Member States not to indulge in such politicization of the work of the United Nations , especially with respect to an issue as important and urgent as our children . When we allow the issue of human rights to be used as a political weapon we cast doubt on our very commitment to human rights and we damage the credibility of this institution and its ability to work effectively on issues of common concern . Israel yearns for the day when peace is the prevailing global condition , and when there is no longer any need to deal with the specific impact of armed conflict on children . But until that day , the international community must continue to act with resolve in extending protection to those who are most vulnerable . Israel is a full partner in this endeavour and will act through all means to ensure that all the world's children enjoy their fundamental right to grow up free from fear , free from suffering and free from the horrors of war and terrorism . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker is the representative of Ethiopia . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Hussein ( Ethiopia ) : At the outset , Sir , let me congratulate you and your delegation on your assumption of the presidency of the Council . My congratulations go also to the new non-permanent members : Angola , Chile , Germany , Pakistan and Spain . Ethiopia is grateful for this opportunity to address the Council on the issue of children and armed conflict . My delegation would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his report on children and armed conflict ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) as well as for his brief but important presentation this morning . I also join previous speakers in thanking Mr. Olara Otunnu and Ms. Carol Bellamy for the excellent presentations they made and for pointing out important issues we need to follow up on . I know that time is short and that there are many other speakers on the list , so I shall cite only some of the points I was going to make ; copies of my full statement have been made available . Today's debate is the fifth open debate the Security Council has devoted to the protection of children in armed conflict . That indicates that it is very serious about this issue and gives it the importance that it deserves . We also welcome the continued efforts of the Secretary-General to put the protection of children in armed conflict on the peace and security agenda of the United Nations ; in that respect we strongly support his recommendation to integrate child protection in peacemaking , peacekeeping and peace-building operations of the United Nations . There are many who are involved in the work of making the lives of children more agreeable in all its aspects . But I will cite only two : the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and the United Nations Children's Fund . I commend them for their work and for their activities on behalf of children . One can list many things ; one can say many things . I think what needs to be said has been said by the Secretary-General and by all those who spoke before me . But I will say that there are two areas implied in the title of what we are discussing today : "" Children and armed conflict "" . Under the first , we have to take all the actions needed to stop those who violate the rights and the sanctity of the lives of children and take action against them . Secondly , when we talk of armed conflict , we have to look at the root causes of such conflict all over the world . I would conclude by saying that if the Council and the international community took a fraction of the time and resources they are now spending on one particular area of the world and spent it on this issue of stopping those who are attacking children , abducting children and recruiting children , then I am sure within a short period , even before the end of this year , that problem would have been dealt with . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the representative of Ethiopia for the kind words addressed to my delegation . The next speaker is the representative of Costa Rica . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Stagno ( Costa Rica ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : Over the past four years the Security Council has been holding periodic open debates on the situation of children in armed conflict . Unfortunately , the debates have had little practical impact . Mr. Olara Otunnu , Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict , has reminded us that today more than 300,000 children under the age of 18 are involved in more than 30 armed conflicts . Millions of children have been the innocent victims of war : they have been killed , have become refugees or have been displaced . Hundreds of thousands more have been orphaned or left defenceless as a result of armed conflict . To be sure , in the past few years some progress has been made at the legal level . We welcome the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts , which bans compulsory recruitment and participation in hostilities for those under the age of 18 . Unfortunately , the Protocol does not also prohibit voluntary recruitment of minors . We are also pleased at the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , which classifies as a war crime the recruitment of children under the age of 15 . But much remains to be done , and all States should now accede to the Optional Protocol and the Rome Statute . We were pleased to see the inclusion in the Secretary-General's report of a list of parties to armed conflicts that recruit or use children as combatants , in violation of their international obligations under paragraph 16 of resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) . It is high time for the international community to shoulder its responsibilities vis-à-vis those who are committing such massive violations of the fundamental rights of children . The Security Council must act . The Council must now require of those entities and States on the list that they stop recruiting children and demobilize those already recruited . Where necessary , the Council should consider imposing sanctions on entities or Governments that use or recruit children in their armed forces . But we can not fail to note that we do not agree with the rather restrictive interpretation offered by the Secretary-General of the mandate contained in paragraph 16 of resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) . In particular , we would question the Secretariat's decision to include on the list only those situations currently on the Council's agenda . We believe that the Secretariat would have done better by the children of the world had it adopted a broader approach to its mandate . We would like , therefore , to invite members of the Security Council to give detailed consideration to a parallel report that was prepared by a coalition of non-governmental organizations , the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers . This parallel report includes a number of well-founded accusations against various governmental , paramilitary and revolutionary entities in 25 countries , as well as a list of specific recommendations to deal with each one of them . I would like , if I may , to mention a few of them . For example , on Afghanistan , the Coalition recommends that the Security Council monitor the new national army and existing factions so as to ensure that they are not recruiting children under the age of 18 . On Somalia , they also recommend to all parties that they adopt a policy of non-recruitment of children under the age of 18 . On Angola , Burundi , Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone , the Coalition recommends the implementation of specific programmes for the demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers as well as the creation of educational and employment opportunities in refugee camps , as an alternative to joining a rebel force . On Colombia , the Sudan , India and Indonesia , the Coalition recommends the inclusion of all revolutionary and paramilitary groups on the list prepared pursuant to paragraph 16 . On Myanmar , the Coalition believes that both Government and opposition forces should be included in the list . The Coalition recommends that the Government and opposition groups in Liberia should demobilize child soldiers . On Macedonia , Yugoslavia and Pakistan , it deems necessary further investigation to determine if opposition paramilitary groups are , in fact , recruiting children . On the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nepal , the Coalition suggests , inter alia , the classification of the recruitment of children as a criminal offence . With respect to Palestine and the occupied territories , the Coalition calls on the various groups not to encourage children to participate in acts of violence . With respect to the Russian Federation , the Coalition is proposing that the Chechen rebel groups be included on the paragraph 16 list . On Rwanda and Uganda , the Coalition recommends the adoption of measures to implement the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child , including the carrying out of programmes for the demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers . Lastly , the Coalition recommends that the Secretary-General draw the attention of the Security Council to the situation in Sri Lanka . As can be seen from this list of recommendations , the Security Council is facing a tremendous task if an end is to be put to the use of child soldiers . Accordingly , we believe that the Council must adopt a holistic approach to protect young people . First , the Council should ensure that any resolution or measure adopted to deal with a specific situation of armed conflict must include clear and specific provisions aimed at safeguarding the security and fundamental rights of children during armed confrontation . Second , the Council should set up an institutional mechanism that would enable it to consider , on an ongoing and comprehensive basis , the problem of children in armed conflict . The Council should , accordingly , set up a subsidiary body to monitor the situation of children in all situations that are on the Council's agenda . To that end , it would make use of information provided by Member States and by non-governmental organizations . Following the model of the Counter-Terrorism Committee , the subsidiary body set up should have a group of independent experts who would evaluate objectively the information that is received . They could also carry out fact-finding missions where there are accusations of serious violations of the rights of the child , and they could offer early warning in the event of a situation that might threaten the security of children . Third , the Security Council , with assistance from the Secretary-General , should , on an ongoing basis , maintain , review and update the list of entities that recruit or use children in conflict , in violation of their international obligations . It is essential to broaden the list to include not just situations already on the Council's agenda , but also situations that , because of the seriousness of the violations of children's rights involved , should be referred to the Council by the Secretary-General . In this connection , the Council should request the Secretary-General to update the list regularly . Fourth , the Security Council should ensure that plans for the post-conflict demobilization , disarmament and reintegration of combatants must include programmes to facilitate the rehabilitation of child soldiers . Peace-building processes must take account of the perspective and the needs of children . Fifth , it is essential to take effective steps to regulate illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , which facilitate the use of children as combatants and are the main weapons used in the destruction wrought . We would advocate a complete prohibition on the transfer of weapons , ammunition and military assistance to Governments or armed groups that violate human rights , including the fundamental rights of children . Sixth , the Security Council , in any peacekeeping operation , must include humanitarian personnel who are dedicated to dealing with the problems of children who are victims of conflict . Such personnel should facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance to children during conflicts . In this context , we are pleased that the Security Council has included in some peacekeeping operations expert advisers on the protection of children . Seventh , before adopting any sanctions regime , the Security Council should carry out an in-depth study of any possible impact on the most vulnerable population , particularly children . Any sanctions regime must include exceptions so as to minimize any damaging impact on children . We deem it essential that the Secretary-General make full use of his powers under Article 99 of the Charter and refer to the Security Council any situations of armed conflict in which young people under the age of 18 are being recruited or used in fighting . Over the long term , the only way to save children from evil consequences of armed conflict is to do away with war . As long as war exists , we can not free children from those harmful consequences . As long as there are wars , children will be orphaned , displaced , hurt or killed . As long as there are wars , schools and hospitals will be burned down , roads destroyed and families broken apart . As long as there are wars , it will be impossible to ensure that children can fully develop into worthy , productive and creative adults . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker on my list is the representative of Indonesia . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Hidayat ( Indonesia ) : My delegation would like to congratulate you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of January and to extend to you its sincere appreciation for organizing this open meeting on one of our key concerns , children and armed conflict . In our view , this meeting is an indication of the Council's continued commitment to the welfare of children in general and of its determination to ensure their protection . At this juncture , I would also like to express my delegation's gratitude to the Secretary-General for his report ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , and to his Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict for his efforts on this issue . Particularly worthy of notice in the current report are the commitments obtained for the protection and well-being of children in conflict and post-conflict situations . Indonesia continues to be concerned about the continued use of children in armed conflict around the world . In this regard , we take particular notice of the list annexed to the report , as requested by the Council in its resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) , of parties to armed conflict that recruit or use children in violation of their international legal obligations . We are disturbed at the abuses that children suffer in camps , and at the general suffering and deprivation that they endure because of conflicts . In that connection , it is also important to point out the persisting problem of humanitarian access in conflict situations . In the occupied Palestinian territories , for example , the Secretary-General reports that the conditions imposed by Israel – notably stricter closures , curfews , roadblocks and checkpoints – have created humanitarian problems including frequent school closures and a drop in immunization levels . This kind of avoidable inhumanity to society , especially to children , must not be allowed to continue . In the past , we have lent our national support to international efforts at ensuring the protection of children in such conflicts and at alleviating the suffering of those who have been unfortunate enough to find themselves in the midst of them . My delegation has always seen these two aspects of the problem : on the one hand , children are deployed as instruments in a situation while , on the other , they are intended and unintended victims . Children who are involved in battle , whether they are hurt or not , are victims , and there is not much of an escape once the bullets , or the logistical demands of conflict , take over . It is the responsibility of those formulating international law within the multilateral system to continue to adopt measures to limit children's involvement in and exposure to conflict . The continued recruitment of under-age children for the purposes of conflict should not continue with impunity . To respond to these concerns , the international community possesses several international instruments , such as the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child , of which Indonesia is a signatory . That Convention underlines the political , social , economic and civil rights of children . Indonesia also supports the Optional Protocol that strengthens the Convention by calling for a minimum age of 18 for eligibility for participation in hostilities . Unfortunately , in recent conflicts the Convention and its Optional Protocol have conveniently been ignored . In this connection , another key international document by which the international community has tried to address this issue in recent times is "" A world fit for children "" ( General Assembly resolution S-27 / 2 , annex ) , the outcome document of the landmark May 2002 special session of the General Assembly on children . It calls on the world community to make the world safer for children , and outlines the responsibilities of nations and the measures they must take in that regard . Among other things , it specifies an assortment of responses to protect children from armed conflict and impunity . We are of the opinion that it is a thorough and strong document that , if implemented , would go a long way towards resolving several issues relating to the protection of children in conflict situations . With reference to post-conflict situations , it is important to take a brief look at the example of what the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) has been able to achieve in Sierra Leone . In 2001 , UNICEF helped more than 3,600 child soldiers in Sierra Leone to leave army life and rejoin their families . The children obtained counselling , vocational training and education towards reintegration into their communities . We commend and support programmes of this nature , not only those of UNICEF and other relevant United Nations agencies , in conflict and post-conflict situations where children have been a factor . Similarly , my delegation stresses the importance of enhancing the monitoring mechanisms spelled out in resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) . Since the adoption of that resolution , we are pleased that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict , and other relevant international agreements and conventions have entered into force . We can not afford to pay only lip service to this very important matter , and must therefore find ways of implementing these critical international instruments . To that end , we congratulate those States that are already making efforts to harmonize their national legislation with available international child rights standards . As we have often said , the future of humanity depends on children , and they must be protected because that is the only protection that the future of mankind has . We can not have our children exposed to violence so early in their lives without expecting them to bear and carry insecurity , violence and hatred within them , especially when they have also forfeited their youth and the chance of a good education at such an early stage of their lives . While conflict itself should be avoided altogether , children should not be dragged into it if it does arise . A child should not have to carry a gun , find himself at the receiving end of gunfire or be hurt by conflict . Rather than celebrate minor moral victories , the international community should focus its attention and evaluation on the larger picture . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the representative of Indonesia for the kind words he addressed to me . The next speaker on my list is the representative of Sierra Leone . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Rowe ( Sierra Leone ) : Mr. President , my delegation would like to associate itself with the words of welcome and congratulation extended to you by previous speakers . We look forward to working with you in your capacity as the President of the Security Council and as the new Permanent Representative of France . Sierra Leone has no more child soldiers . We say this not with a feeling of pride . We have no reason to take pride in the fact that Sierra Leone is not named in the Secretary-General's latest report ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) among areas of conflict where children are still being recruited and / or used as child soldiers . On the contrary , we say Sierra Leone has no more child soldiers only with a sense of relief ; relief that our children , those who survived the atrocious rebel war , are free at last from the abominable practice of recruiting children to kill and be killed . As a country that has just emerged from a prolonged and brutal armed conflict in which children were both perpetrators and victims , we know from experience the immediate and long-term consequences of the abduction , drugging , training and deployment of children for armed combat . Experience has also taught us that urgent action must be taken to put an end to such practices , first and foremost through the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants . In 1999 the Government of Sierra Leone insisted that its peace agreement with the rebel movement the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) must include an appeal to the conscience of the parties to recognize that the children of Sierra Leone , especially those affected by the conflict , in view of their vulnerability , are entitled to special care and protection consistent with the provisions of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child . The Government , for its part , also pledged to accord particular attention to the issue of child soldiers by mobilizing resources through the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , and through the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) and other agencies , to address the special needs of these children in the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration ( DDR ) process . I would like to pay tribute to the Special Representative , Mr. Otunnu , and to Ms. Bellamy of UNICEF for their untiring efforts on behalf of the children of Sierra Leone . We would also like to commend them for their statements this morning . Sierra Leone has also learned from experience that the problem of former child soldiers could be addressed through the establishment of an oversight institution for the welfare of children in a post-conflict situation . Beyond the disarmament and demobilization process , however , we have tried to ensure that the welfare of children and the protection of their right to develop in a peaceful environment are at the centre of government policy-making and resource-allocation strategies . Our thanks again go to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , Mr. Otunnu . His ground-breaking 15-point agenda for action for the children of Sierra Leone paved the way for the establishment in January last year of a statutory National Commission for War-Affected Children . It is now the principal child protection and advocacy mechanism in the country . Although the scope of its work is relatively wide and covers different categories of war-affected children , the Commission is expected to address the special needs of former child combatants . My delegation takes note of the reference in the Secretary-General's report to the risk we face in Sierra Leone of losing thousands of former child combatants to the conflict across the border in Liberia . This underscores our concern that in the absence of adequate resources for implementing the Government's reintegration programme for ex-combatants , especially the thousands of demobilized child ex-combatants , those warlords will take advantage of the situation and recruit them again into the killing circus that has characterized the activities of the rebel movements in the subregion . We therefore endorse wholeheartedly the recommendation that the Security Council and Member States should be urged to provide sustained and adequate resources to the relevant organizations engaged in implementing DDR programmes for children . My delegation strongly believes that the establishment of international norms proscribing the involvement of children in armed conflict , and strict compliance with those norms , are important steps in our collective effort to rid the world of this unconscionable practice . My delegation shares the view set out by the Secretary-General in his report that the codification of international norms and standards for the protection of children during conflict has made an impressive contribution to that effort . Sierra Leone has ratified the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child . We have also become a party to the African regional equivalent , the Organization of African Unity and African Union Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child . Our ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court is also a testimony to our commitment to , among other things , the relevant provisions concerning the recruitment and use of child soldiers , and the mechanism of accountability for crimes specific to children . We also share the view of the Secretary-General that the challenge today is to ensure their implementation on the ground , that is , compliance with these international norms . The list of violators contained in his report is indeed an important step forward in our efforts , as he puts it , "" to induce compliance with international child protection obligations by parties to conflict "" ( S / 2002 / 1299 , para . 28 ) . However , my delegation believes – and we would like to stress this point here – that we must also recognize that rebels and other non-State insurgent groups are not parties to those international instruments on the involvement or use of children in armed conflict . As we witnessed in Sierra Leone , notwithstanding the commitments rebel movements make in peace agreements , these forces , at least in the West African subregion , account , in our view , for most of the recorded abuses of international norms for the protection of children in armed conflict . We recall here the number of instances where the RUF rebel movement reneged on peace and ceasefire agreements . We observe that there are only four Governments on the "" name and shame "" list annexed to the Secretary-General's latest report . That of course does not mean that we should downplay violations by States . The list indicates clearly , as far as we are concerned , that ways and means must be found for dealing more effectively with the role of non-State actors in the recruitment and use of child soldiers . This brings my delegation to a related issue that has been placed on the agenda of the Security Council : the illegal trade and transfer of small arms and light weapons . Many speakers referred to it this morning , and Switzerland and other delegations also spoke about it eloquently this afternoon . The Sierra Leone delegation would like to take this opportunity to reiterate once again its appeal to all States , in particular manufacturers and their agents , to ensure , including through appropriate legislation , that these weapons do not get into the hands of rebel movements and other non-State actors . Security Council arms embargoes and travel restrictions against rebel movements are very important – we recognize that – but are certainly not enough , especially where sanctions monitoring mechanisms do not exist or are woefully ineffective . Finally , based on the Sierra Leone experience , my delegation would like to see in the draft resolution to be adopted by the Security Council following its discussion of the Secretary-General's report some reference to the question of impunity . The Special Court for Sierra Leone should be seen as an example of the type of mechanism available to the international community for addressing impunity , especially impunity related to the recruitment of children to commit heinous atrocities in conflict situations . We feel that the Special Court could be regarded as a court set up for our children's sake . As the prosecutor , David Crane , said recently , the children of Sierra Leone have suffered enough both as victims and as perpetrators . The objective is to prosecute not children , but the people , including those warlords , who forced thousands of children to commit unspeakable crimes . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the representative of Sierra Leone for the kind words he addressed to my delegation . The next speaker is the representative of Slovenia . I invite him to take a seat tat the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Kirn ( Slovenia ) : Slovenia has already associated itself with the statement made by the representative of Greece on behalf of the European Union and with the statement made by the representative of Austria as Chair of the Human Security Network , and we fully endorse both of them . Since the issue of children and armed conflict is one of particular importance for Slovenia , I would like to highlight some points in our national capacity . Let me first express our appreciation to you , Sir , for having convened this meeting . We consider it primarily to be an opportunity to review the progress achieved and to identify further action to be taken . Since the adoption of resolution 1261 ( 1999 ) , the issue of children and armed conflict has been firmly established on the agenda of the Security Council , in recognition of its importance for peace and security , thus adding a new dimension to the discussions in this body , which Slovenia firmly supports . We are pleased to see that a number of significant developments were achieved in the past year , particularly in the normative domain , such as the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court . Slovenia ratified the Rome Statute in December 2001 , and we are looking forward to the constitution of the new Court in March this year . Almost a year ago , the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict entered into force , and it is encouraging to note the growing acceptance of this new instrument . Slovenia will ratify it in the very near future . The special session of the General Assembly on children , held last May , and the adoption of the outcome document , "" A world fit for children "" reaffirmed our joint commitment to protect children during armed conflict , in accordance with international humanitarian and human rights law . This provides the necessary political , as well as legal frameworks , to combat the abuse of children in armed conflict . We call on all Member States and all other parties in conflict to fully implement or respect their provisions , and especially to act against impunity for all crimes committed against children . Slovenia welcomes the most recent report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict . We would like to express our sincere appreciation of and support for Special Representative Olara Otunnu and his Office for their work in this respect . This is the first time that parties recruiting and using child soldiers have been specifically identified , giving us a clear picture of who the perpetrators of crimes against children really are . The report and the annex list represent a very clear sign that the international community is no longer ready to tolerate abuses of children in conflict situations . They also represent a concrete contribution to the raising of global awareness on this issue . Slovenia shares the views expressed that the report should be the first step towards drawing up an integral list of all parties using children , not only those involved in situations on the Security Council's agenda . Austria , on behalf of the Human Security Network , presented a set of specific recommendations to the Council on how to further address this issue , and Slovenia fully supports those recommendations . I should like just to recall the need to regularly update the list , to extend it by including situations that are not on the Security Council's agenda and to ensure that the issue of war-affected children is taken fully into account in all of its decisions on peacemaking , peacekeeping and peace-building operations . Another positive development this year is the beginning of the deployment of child protection advisers in some United Nations peace operations . We concur with the Secretary-General and his Special Representative that the deployment of such advisers in each United Nations peace operation is highly desirable . In addition to efforts undertaken globally , regional and interregional action is needed . We greatly appreciate the opportunity to share our views with the like-minded countries of the Human Security Network . As pointed out by Austria , the Network believes that it can significantly contribute to the global debate on the issue , as well as improve the situation in our respective regions through various concrete activities . Being aware of the importance of children for the future and for the prosperity of our societies , Slovenia decided several years ago to contribute to the recovery of South-Eastern Europe by establishing an institution to assist war-affected children – the Regional Centre for the Psychosocial Well-being of Children , which is also called "" Together "" . The basic aim of the Centre is to strengthen local structures in the field of child care , to develop mechanisms for their psycho-social protection and to empower war-affected children , remaining in the region even after international assistance has been withdrawn . We would like to thank all donors and to invite all other countries and institutions to work with us to improve the situation of war-affected children in South-Eastern Europe . Another of Slovenia's initiatives contributing to the safety of children in the region of South-Eastern Europe is in the area of anti-personnel mines and demining – the work conducted by the Slovenia-based International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victim Assistance . The report of the Secretary-General points out that little progress has been made regarding efforts to sever the link between the proliferation and widespread use of small arms and light weapons and the related victimization of children . In this regard , I am pleased to inform the Security Council that a United Nations subregional conference on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , co-organized by the United Nations and Slovenia , will be held in Slovenia in March this year . We hope that the conference will contribute to reducing the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and its negative impact , including its impact on children , in the region of South-Eastern Europe . In conclusion , allow me to reassure you , Mr. President , that Slovenia fully supports all endeavours of the Office of the Special Representative , the United Nations Children's Fund and other United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations in this field . We encourage continuous and meaningful dialogue and cooperation among all of us , with the aim of alleviating the plight of children affected by armed conflict . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Myanmar . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Swe ( Myanmar ) : In congratulating you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency of the Council , I would also like to thank you for convening a public meeting on children and armed conflict . The situation of children in armed conflict is heart-wrenching . As the Secretary-General's report pointed out , war displaces families and communities , and children are at risk of exploitation and forcible recruitment . This underscores the fact that peace and stability are important , not only for the development of the country concerned but also for the welfare of its population , particularly women and children , which are the most vulnerable groups in conflict situations . As reflected in the Secretary-General's report , impressive gains have been made in codifying international norms and standards for the protection and well-being of children . We share the opinion that there is a need to promote and disseminate these norms and standards and to raise awareness about them on the ground . We take satisfaction from the fact that , in preparing the list , the Secretary-General was guided by resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) . We note , however , that the report departed from its mandate when it made reference , under situations of concern not included in the list , to a number of countries , including Myanmar . We particularly regret that in addition to the armed insurgent groups in Myanmar , the national armed forces were also referred to – this despite the fact that there is no credible evidence of the use and recruitment of children by the Myanmar Armed Forces . In that regard , I share the view expressed this morning by one Council member about the need for verification and checking the validity of information before it is presented to the Security Council . Nor should the issue of protection of children be politicized . The allegation made regarding my country is the result of interviewing 20 or so insurgents inside a neighbouring country . Additionally , the situation in Myanmar is not , by any stretch of the imagination , a threat to international peace and security . The Myanmar armed forces is an all-volunteer army . Those entering military service do so of their own free will . Under the Myanmar Defence Services Act of 1974 and War Office Council Instruction 13 / 73 , a person can not enlist in the armed forces until he has attained the age of 18 . There is neither a draft system nor forced conscription by the Government of Myanmar . The Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights , who had visited Myanmar four times , expressed concern in his report over : "" abuses of civilians and refugees on the part of armed opposition groups , notably the Karenni National Liberation Army , which has been accused of forced conscription of male villagers , including under-age youths "" . ( A / 57 / 290 , para . It is a practice of armed insurgent groups in Myanmar to recruit and abuse child soldiers . That was brought to the wide attention of the international community in 2000 , when some members of a splinter insurgent group , styling themselves as God's Army , took over a hospital in Ratchaburi , in Thailand , taking 700 people hostage . The self-styled God's Army is an insurgent group led by two 10-year-old twins , Johnny and Luther Htoo . We share the view of many delegations that the best way of protecting children in armed conflict lies in conflict prevention and resolution . Myanmar regained its independence in January 1948 . In a matter of months , it had to face the challenge of insurgencies by various armed groups . Until recently , there were 18 armed insurgent groups in the country , as well as a narco-trafficking armed group . For over 40 years , Myanmar had to suffer the scourge of insurgency . The ethnic insurgencies which had existed in Myanmar since its independence were contained and rolled back only in recent years through the painstaking efforts of the Government . As a result , 17 armed ethnic insurgent groups have participated in the exchange of arms for peace programme . They are now actively engaged in development activities in their respective regions , together with the Government . Apart from a splinter armed group of narco-traffickers , only one ethnic insurgent group , the Kayin National Union ( KNU ) , remains to return to the fold , and the Government continues to extend an olive branch to this group . For the first time in nearly half a century , the armed conflict that plagued Myanmar has ceased in all parts of the country with the exception of a few border areas . The Special Rapporteur on human rights , in commending the achievement of the ceasefire agreements by the Government with 17 armed ethnic groups , stated in his report : "" After decades of fear , insecurity and widespread violence the first dividend of the ceasefire agreements is peace and the second is some development "" ( ibid. , para . The Government is promoting a culture of peace . We are fully aware that , in any conflict situation , children are among the most vulnerable groups . We share the determination to give the fullest attention to the question of protection of children in armed conflict . The Secretary-General's report has pointed out that education has also been a casualty of war . In Myanmar , since civil insurgency has effectively been overcome in nearly all parts of the country , the Government has been able to concentrate its efforts on development of the areas where fighting raged for over four decades . In 1992 , the Government set up a separate ministry for that purpose and was able to bring development to those areas . It has built hospitals , roads and bridges in these border areas . From 1988-1989 to 1998-1999 , in a span of 10 years , it built more than 350 schools in the former insurgent-held areas . The Government has now been able to provide child immunization for all children nationwide . We are able to conduct extensive immunization programmes in the remote areas . It is a time-honoured tradition in Myanmar to place special emphasis on the overall development of children and to ensure their protection , upbringing and development . In bringing about peace and stability , we endeavour to provide the children with a peaceful and developed world so that they will have a secure and enabling environment to develop their individual capabilities . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Colombia . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Valdivieso ( Colombia ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : I am pleased , Sir , to see you representing France and presiding over this Security Council meeting devoted to an item that connects two important aspects of United Nations action in the world : the maintenance of international peace and the protection of children . My delegation is grateful for the presentations made at the beginning of the meeting by the Secretary-General , by his Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict , Mr. Olara Otunnu , and by the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) , Ms. Carol Bellamy . We acknowledge the commitment of these latter two officials in ensuring that peacekeeping operations focus on the special needs of children in conflict situations . The needs of children are one aspect of the broad actions required to protect civilians in armed conflict . In this respect , I would like to recall that in the statement issued on 20 December 2002 on the protection of civilians in armed conflicts ( S / PRST / 2002 / 41 ) , the Council encouraged United Nations agencies to cooperate with Member States in formulating a comprehensive , coherent and action-oriented approach to the protection of civilians in armed conflict . The report of the Secretary-General ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , which is the basis for this debate , highlighted several special needs of children in conflict situations . It referred , among other things , to juvenile justice , education on the risks of landmines , and care for internally displaced children and for girls who are exposed to sexual abuse . Therefore , we encourage Council members to bear those needs clearly in mind when considering conflicts that are included in their programme of work . The problem of child soldiers is so important that it has captured the attention of agencies , such as the World Bank , which in the past were quite remote from this topic . The report's list of military forces and rebel groups that recruit children alerts us to the need to resolve these conflicts and to counter the world trade in small arms and light weapons . We call on the Council to consider establishing the origin of arms that are used by groups that recruit minors , and we call , in particular , on arms-exporting countries , for greater controls . We regret the fact that many rebel groups within Colombia continue to recruit and kidnap children in order to carry out their attacks against society . The Government of Colombia , in accordance with its accession to international conventions – in particular to the relevant Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child – does not recruit those younger than 18 in its military forces . We encourage other States to accede to the Protocol and to respect this limit on compulsory recruitment and on the participation of minors in combat . As this is my last official function as representative of Colombia to the United Nations , I should like to thank you , Mr. President , for the opportunity to participate in this debate . I assure you that it will guide my personal action in this area in the coming years . In addition , I thank my colleagues of the countries members of the Security Council for the friendship and cooperation that they extended to me during Colombia's two years on the Council , which concluded just a few days ago . Moreover , I should like to wish the new members every success in their work on behalf of international peace . The President ( spoke in French ) : I should like to take this opportunity , on behalf of the members of the Security Council , to say that we regret the departure of the Permanent Representative of Colombia , to thank him for his very valuable contribution to the Council's work over the past two years , and warmly to wish him every success in his future endeavours . The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Malawi . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Lamba ( Malawi ) : Let me begin by saying that I shall present what one might call a summary in the interests of time . Copies of my complete statement have been deposited with the conference officers . I should like to join preceding speakers in congratulating you , Sir , on assuming the presidency of this important organ of the United Nations and in thanking you and the Security Council for organizing this important debate to highlight the plight of children in conflict situations . My delegation would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General on his lucid and candid report on children and armed conflict ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , which forms the substance of this debate . Special acknowledgement also goes to the excellent presentations by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , Mr. Olara Otunnu , and by the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund , Ms. Carol Bellamy . The information that has been provided will undoubtedly lead to soul-searching with regard to the strategies needed for the protection of children , especially in armed conflicts , but also for the necessary post-conflict care . My delegation is satisfied with the approach aimed at monitoring and reporting the treatment of children through the codification of international norms and standards to secure maximum protection . Malawi can not claim much experience in armed conflict , and the problem of children now under discussion might be considered rather peripheral on Malawi's socio-economic agenda . However , the welfare of children must form the central feature of any nation's socio-economic planning . Malawi has supported all actions designed to create an improved environment for our children's realization of their full physical , emotional and intellectual potential . All regional and international protocols for children have been accorded Malawi's support . Malawi considers imperative the promotion of any action that alleviates children's suffering and deprivation , which negatively affect their hope for a good future . Although Malawi may not be engaged in conflict or warfare , it – like many other African countries – is engaged in a more subtle war against the HIV / AIDS pandemic , which has created approximately 600,000 orphans , of whom no less than one fifth were born already infected with HIV and therefore face a bleak future in an environment blighted by excessive poverty . The Malawi Government has placed children high on its development agenda , and its vigorous intervention in child development – which covers nutrition , water and sanitation , psycho-social care , education and health – demonstrates its seriousness in addressing the welfare of children . Malawi ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991 , and the Government is working in collaboration with the Committee on the Rights of the Child to assiduously monitor the implementation of the Convention . Other concrete measures taken by the Government include the establishment , in 1999 , of a children's rights unit within the Malawi Human Rights Commission to protect children from abuse , violence and exploitation . The Malawi Law Commission has embarked on a review of existing legislation to bring it into conformity with international human rights standards , including those for children . Financial and technical assistance will be needed here to promote the administration of juvenile justice and human rights education . Malawi is also a signatory to all International Labour Organization protocols , and national legislation has been enacted to regulate the minimum age of employment . The United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) has always proved to be an ardent partner in the improvement of the state of Malawi's children . Our achievements today must contribute to a positive and hopeful future for our children . That is why my delegation commends the Secretary-General's report for exposing and providing heightened awareness of the plight of children created by a senseless adult world . My delegation fully endorses all measures proposed and adopted for the creation of a world fit for children and all actions taken under international humanitarian and human rights law to induce compliance by the perpetrators of crimes against children . Therefore , my delegation hopes for systematic international compliance , on the part of both States parties and insurgent armed groups , with two instruments : the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court . In the report , Malawi is pleased to note the United Nations offer of technical and legal assistance in the area of ensuring children's rights . In conflict regions , no child can be safe , whether that child is in the fighting ranks or in a devastated home environment . The trauma experienced by children in conflict remains with them long afterwards . Malawi therefore endorses the establishment of child protection advisers in affected countries , such as Angola , Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo , to collaborate with other stakeholders , such as UNICEF and Governments . Indeed , children's rights must be highlighted on the United Nations agenda of peacemaking , peacekeeping and peace-building , with child protection adequately integrated into that agenda . It is our hope that the draft guidelines formulated by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Political Affairs will make an effective contribution to the promotion of effective child protection . The proposed comprehensive child protection training to supervise the conduct of staff towards children in mission areas stands out as a necessary initiative that deserves unqualified support . Equally important is the suggested inclusion of landmine risk education programmes and rehabilitation of child victims of mines . The exploitation of children as forced labour to extract natural resources in various countries , including the Democratic Republic of the Congo , only emphasizes the inhuman tragedy faced by displaced children . A childhood spent in refugee camps encounters enormous challenges . Indeed , apart from forced labour , the recruitment of children by armed forces and by other groups deprives them of the right to education , to proper health care , to development and , above all , to choices . A refugee camp in a foreign country creates an even more complicated situation for children . Malawi fully supports the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , whose work and intervention brings hope to the many suffering children . The horrible experiences of girls and women in armed conflicts present a nemesis to any norms of civilization and form a topic deserving urgent action . The substantial claims of sexual exploitation involving rape , forced recruitment , abduction and trafficking all serve as condemning testimony to the absence of commitment to practical support for girls' welfare . On a different occasion in the United Nations , Malawi expressed total condemnation of the despicable sexual exploitation of girls in conflict zones not only by armed forces , but , more disturbingly , by aid workers and peacekeepers . Malawi notes with satisfaction the Plan of Action of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee's Task Force on Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises , the strict implementation of which should make a significant difference and contribution towards the protection of girls from sexual exploitation . My delegation would like to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General for including in his report lists of people and States involved in the violation of the legal and human rights of children who find themselves subjected to various indignities and deprivation . The list should create a time for reflection over the important obligation of international child protection through unquestionable compliance with international agreements and protocols . Malawi will support any Security Council actions with respect to States and organizations listed in the report . Children's rights deserve respect and their flagrant violation with impunity should not be tolerated and must be addressed through recourse to punitive measures , such as tough sanctions . Finally , the field visits of the Special Representative have demonstrated the crucial importance of such an approach to verify and elucidate the war-affected child's situation in conflict zones . Such visits , which need to be encouraged , give the Special Representative a visual picture of the extent of the problem . The data so competently collected enriches our comprehension of the child's predicament . As the Security Council deliberates the problems facing the child in conflict areas , it is Malawi's strong plea that children facing other crises , such as HIV / AIDS , should feature in the Special Representative's future itinerary . For example , Malawi , where the pandemic has created untold misery for children , would benefit from a proactive visit by the Special Representative to assess the efficacy of the interventions and child-protection measures currently in place and subsequently to advise appropriately . My delegation would like to conclude this statement by once again thanking the Secretary-General for submitting a landmark report on children , which will challenge the deliberations of the Security Council . If the mishandled child , who holds the future , can not be considered a security issue , what can ? If we can not demonstrate concern for the child now , who will and when ? There is no time to stand idle and watch . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Liechtenstein . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Wenaweser ( Liechtenstein ) ( spoke in French ) : At the outset , I should like to thank you , Sir , for convening this meeting on a subject to which we attach the highest importance . ( spoke in English ) Liechtenstein welcomes action by the Security Council on the issue of children and armed conflict and , in particular , the open debates , the products of which have been instrumental in creating a normative framework for the protection of children affected by armed conflict . Much to our satisfaction , the special session on children last year also placed strong emphasis on this topic . As far as standard-setting is concerned , the year 2002 was a good one for children . Two new legal instruments entered into force : the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography and the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict . Liechtenstein has signed both of these Protocols and is preparing to ratify them . Another step forward – an historic step indeed – was the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court . The Statute , among other things , provides for the better protection of children , especially but not exclusively in times of armed conflict . The inclusion of the recruitment and use by all parties to a conflict of children under the age of 15 in conflicts of both an international and non-international character as a war crime is of special importance in this respect . Success in standard-setting must not give us cause for complacency – quite to the contrary . While the existing standards are high , the picture continues to be very grim when it comes to their application . The rights of millions of children around the world continue to be violated in numerous and brutal ways . Children affected by armed conflict , with all its manifold and devastating consequences , are in the worst situation . We therefore agree with the Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict that we must move with resolve into an era of application , which was also one of the lessons we drew from last year's special session on children . In the implementation of these existing norms , the Security Council can play a central role . The creation of a list of parties to conflicts on the Council's agenda that continue to recruit or use child soldiers is one measure through which to make progress in assuring compliance with international obligations . The list should be expanded to cover parties to conflicts in a global manner , not only in situations on the agenda of the Council . We welcome such practical steps and hope that the Council will again agree on a strong response to the report before us and thus ensure a follow-up based on the recommendations contained in the report . We welcome the report before the Council and its emphasis on systematically integrating child protection objectives into the mandates of peace operations , including through the deployment of child protection advisers and special training for peacekeeping personnel . Given the importance of the participation of children in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , children must be given a voice , in particular in the process of post-conflict peace-building , rather than merely having their best interests represented by others . Liechtenstein has supported the work of the Special Representative , Mr. Olara Otunnu , right from the inception of his mandate . His advocacy on behalf of children in armed conflict over the past six years has been heard widely and proven effective . Worldwide awareness of children and the ways in which they are affected by armed conflict is increasing . In order to enhance the application of the legal instruments I referred to at the outset of my statement , more needs to be done to make these achievements better known . Advocacy and creating awareness help to broaden the base of support and to get more stakeholders involved . In this context , the work and involvement of non-governmental organizations and civil society groups can be instrumental , especially in highlighting different aspects of the plight of children affected by armed conflict . In this context , we have taken note with great interest of two reports : first , the "" 1379 Report "" of the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers and , secondly , the study on the voices of girl child soldiers presented by the Quaker United Nations Office . The situation of the girl child is one aspect that requires our special attention in order to effectively protect the rights and well-being of children affected by armed conflicts . Those conflicts have manifold and complex consequences for all children , but specific forms of victimization are often added to the plight of girls and women . Rape , abduction , sexual enslavement and trafficking are some of the crimes perpetrated against female victims in particular . What is characteristic of such crimes is their traumatic nature and long-term effects . One figure may illustrate this point : two out of three women and girls raped during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda have reportedly tested positive for HIV / AIDS . It is therefore no exaggeration to say that the genocide continues in a silent way . True stability and security can not be re-established for long after an armed conflict has subsided , because of the specific crimes inflicted especially upon women and girls . All of that is to say that the international community would be well advised to address very specific issues and details regarding children affected by armed conflict . As I indicated at the outset , it does not suffice to adopt broad norms and standards . The effects of armed conflicts on children , the different forms of child labour and sexual exploitation and the resulting special vulnerability of children to the HIV / AIDS pandemic stand out as areas where concerted national and international action is a prerequisite for successful and durable solutions . All these issues constitute large-scale crises that can be addressed only through specific and coordinated action by all of us . Nobody must be allowed to deprive children of both their childhood and their future . By permitting this we would be violating a moral imperative we all hold dear . But , moreover , we would not only be destroying the future of individual children but also the collective future of the countries concerned . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Ileka ( Democratic Republic of the Congo ) ( spoke in French ) : I have the pleasant duty of expressing my delegation's satisfaction at seeing the representative of France presiding over the Security Council as we begin the year . My country enjoys excellent relations with France , relations that are based on mutual trust and respect . Allow me also , Mr. President , to pay tribute to your predecessor , the representative of Colombia . I commend him for the skill and ability with which he discharged his difficult tasks during his presidency last month . I would like to congratulate Angola , Chile , Germany , Pakistan and Spain on becoming members of the Council . I would also like to pay well-deserved tribute to the outgoing members . We are very grateful to them for their efforts , in particular with regard to the search for peace in my country . Lastly , I would like to thank you , Mr. President , for having convened this meeting of the Security Council . I also express my gratitude for the Secretary-General's important report on children and armed conflict ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , which Special Representative Olara Otunnu presented this morning with his usual eloquence . I also thank Ms. Carol Bellamy , Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) , for her important statement . With regard to the item under consideration , I would like to remind the Council that problems pertaining to the protection of children are central to my Government's primary concerns . That concern is reflected , for example , in the existence of an institutional and legal framework to guarantee the rights of children . Despite the continuing financial difficulties and war , my Government has reacted positively to all the recommendations relating to the protection of children that are contained in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , including resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) on the subject of women and peace and security . Furthermore , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is party to the major international instruments on the protection of the rights of the child , including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography , the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child , International Labour Organization ( ILO ) Convention No. 138 – concerning the minimum age for employment – and No. 182 – on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour , and , of course , the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) . The implementation of the Rome Statute is of great importance to my Government , which expended great effort to facilitate its entry into force , which took place on 1 July 2002 . This treaty includes an important provision to protect the rights of children , making it a war crime to conscript children under the age of 15 years into national armed forces . The Council should also recall that my Government has been greatly involved in the process of protecting children , including through the promulgation of its Decree-Law No. 66 , of 9 June 2000 , which dealt with the demobilization and reintegration of vulnerable groups in armed forces . That political will has been reflected in the establishment of an appropriate structure , the National Bureau for Demobilization and Reintegration ( BUNADER ) , which is charged with following up and implementing the decree-law in partnership with UNICEF , whose valuable work is greatly appreciated . Since 1997 , my Government has been aware of the urgency of the need to end the presence of child soldiers known as kadogo in the Congolese armed forces . Since that time , my Government has developed several programmes to demobilize child soldiers . Most of those programmes required multilateral support , in particular through the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the Human Rights Field Office in Kinshasa . Other programmes required bilateral assistance . While today we welcome the sincere cooperation and partnership that has developed between my Government and the United Nations system as a whole , as well as the efforts under way to end this deplorable situation and fully implement norms and principles on the rights of the child and on their protection , we must nevertheless recognize that , at the time , the response of the United Nations , the international community and donor countries did not meet our expectations . Reasons having to do with security , inaccessibility and , frankly , a lack of confidence in the capacity and the will of my Government to implement its policies to protect the rights of the child resulted in the United Nations being very late in providing support to my Government with regard to formulating appropriate policies to protect children in armed conflict and implementing initiatives , particularly outreach initiatives and those aimed at raising awareness . Nevertheless – pursuant to the relevant provisions of resolution 1261 ( 1999 ) of 25 August 1999 , in which the Security Council called upon States and the relevant parts of the United Nations system to intensify their efforts to end the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict – I would like to reaffirm to the Council that the Democratic Republic of the Congo has ended the enlistment of children in the Congolese armed forces . That is in contrast to the behaviour of the armed groups that hold sway in occupied provinces , which continue to employ child soldiers in the theatre of military operations . A process of demobilization for child soldiers is now taking place under the supervision of BUNADER and UNICEF . However , the future of those soldiers continues to be of major concern and to pose an immense problem . When one takes into account the fact that serious acts of banditry , particularly in Kinshasa , are being carried out by armed young people , one has to wonder about the wisdom of launching these young people into the world without any financial incentives or viable possibilities to reintegrate into society , especially as we are dealing with young people in their prime who know how to handle weapons . This phenomenon represents a time bomb for the entire Congolese society , as well as a real problem that the United Nations is tackling very timidly and one that the Government alone can not address due to a lack of funds . It is important that steps be taken not only immediately but also through the implementation of chapter VI of the comprehensive , inclusive agreement on the transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , relating to the training of our national army . We must all take concrete action very quickly . Paragraph 55 of the report of the Secretary-General under consideration ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) mentions a commitment by the World Bank and donor countries to support a regional multi-country demobilization and reintegration programme for the entire Great Lakes region . To us , such a commitment still seems to be a long way off . Last Thursday , France made 1 million euros available to the United Nations Development Programme . Of that amount , 200,000 euros are immediately available for a programme to return to civilian life foreign ex-combatants located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . France's contribution , following a contribution of 2 million euros to the funds of the World Bank , gives France the leading rank in support for the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration programme of United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) . That will greatly assist the return of foreign ex-combatants – including the child soldiers among them – to their countries of origin and their families and homes . Furthermore , implementing the relevant provisions of resolutions 1314 ( 2000 ) and 1379 ( 2001 ) , MONUC has established child protection units . But given the proliferation of armed groups and their dispersion , and given the size of our national territory , one might question their effectiveness and advocate a substantial increase in the number of their personnel within MONUC so that they can be more effective . The international community is also called on to help the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the implementation by the Government and the future transition authorities of the relevant recommendations made by the delegates to the inter-Congolese dialogue . The war of aggression that has raged in my country for four years now , in violation of the United Nations Charter , has not only given rise to the phenomenon of child soldiers , whose forced recruitment continues in the occupied provinces . For children , this war has brought a succession of miseries , of which they are the first victims . Thousands of them survive , marginalized throughout the country , cut off from society and their own families , living in the streets alone or in groups , sexually exploited and abused , breaking the law , without protection or future . This war of aggression has also led to the forced , brutal and tragic displacement of populations within the borders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has forced many Congolese into exile in neighbouring countries . It has also encouraged all kinds of violations of fundamental human rights , particularly those related to the physical integrity of women and children . My delegation wishes to express my Government's concern at the events currently taking place in the east , in Uvira , and further north , in Beni , Mambasa , Bunia , Kilo , Mongwalu and Mahagi . A major humanitarian crisis has been created , especially due to the forced displacement of thousands of people , which has been confirmed by MONUC . Purely commercial reasons are at the base of this upsurge in tension , in which , through opposing Congolese factions , Ugandan generals and Rwandan businessmen equally attempt to gain control of the goldmines of Kilo-Moto and of the Mongwalu area . My Government denounces the delaying tactics employed by Rwanda and Uganda , as well as their manoeuvring to prolong the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Those two countries , after signing agreements with my country , were quick to incite new rebellions and create new warlords . Uganda created the Union des patriotes congolais ( UPC ) – headed by Mr. Thomas Lubanga , a notorious hostage-taker and known criminal – which is not a signatory of the Pretoria Agreement . For its part , Rwanda has given the present Governor of Nord-Kivu , Mr. Serufuli , responsibility for leading a militia of almost 20,000 men , essentially Hutus released from the prisons of Rwanda by the Kigali Government , with the mission of sowing terror , looting and committing massacres among the civilian population . My Government expresses its dismay at information reporting widespread cases of looting and mass rape of women and girls and summary and extrajudicial executions perpetrated by the Mouvement pour le libération du Congo ( MLC ) and its ally , the Rassemblement congolais pour la démocratie-National ( RCD-N ) , as well as by the UPC . My Government is scandalized by the discovery of mass graves in Mambasa , where violent clashes continue between , on the one side , the troops of the Rassemblement congolais pour la démocratie – Mouvement de libération ( RCD-ML ) and on the other , the troops of the RCD-N , in coalition with the MLC . My Government is shocked at the allegations made by representatives of the Catholic Church and non-governmental organizations for the defence of human rights alleging acts of cannibalism by soldiers of the MLC and the RCD-N , principally and specifically targeting pygmy populations and the Nande people . My Government awaits the conclusions of the investigation carried out by the United Nations and hopes that those conclusions will be made public so that light will be shed on that indescribable act of terror and those dreadful events . If that unimaginable barbaric savagery turns out to be true , my Government would ask the Security Council to take against the alleged perpetrators , authors and those responsible all measures authorized under the Charter of the United Nations in order to stop those atrocities and crimes , which now fall within the purview of the International Criminal Court . In conclusion , my Government appeals to all our international , regional and subregional partners to help us carry out our programme to promote and to protect the rights of children . There is an urgent need to renew international commitments to make children a priority so that we do not waste the most precious human resource in the world and to build a stable and productive society . The future of the Democratic Republic of the Congo lies in the well-being of its children . Investing in children today will ensure peace , stability , security , democracy and sustainable development for present and future generations . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for his kind words addressed to my country . The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Burundi . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Nteturuye ( Burundi ) ( spoke in French ) : My delegation is sincerely pleased to see you , Sir , presiding over the work of the Security Council for the first time since you assumed your new duties . We wish you every success in your mission . How fortunate that the first public meeting of the Council over which you are presiding is dedicated to the situation of children in armed conflicts , a subject of utmost importance and one to which France has always given special attention . I also congratulate the new members of the Security Council and wish them every success in their noble task . I would like to welcome the presence among us of our brother Mr. Olara Otunnu , who has made such great efforts to raise the awareness of the international community and mobilize it to assist children , whose innocence is brutalized by the belligerents of the conflicts currently raging throughout the world . The report of the Secretary-General ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) before us is extremely clear on the suffering of children in conflicts and on the proposed approaches for a solution , especially through the implementation of international conventions that already exist or are in the process of being adopted . Burundi is mentioned in the report , in which the principal belligerents – the Government , the rebels of the Front pour la défense de la démocratie ( FDD ) and of the Parti pour la libération du peuple hutu / Forces nationales pour la libération ( PALIPEHUTU / FNL ) – are accused of using child soldiers in their conflict . I should like to recall here that the war that has been raging in Burundi since 1993 has particularly affected the vulnerable populations , including children . They are the ones who suffer most from diseases related to the poor hygiene and other negative conditions prevailing in camps for internally displaced persons and refugees . They also suffer most from poor nutrition and food shortages ; the destruction or closing of schools , health clinics and hospitals ; and from the many horrors of war . The phenomenon of street children in urban areas – in Burundi and elsewhere – is a shocking reality of civil war in our States . The task of rehabilitating children therefore is a multidimensional one , as indicated by international norms to protect children in situations of conflict . In Burundi , there is , however , a glimmer of hope for the entire population , and in particular for children . That hope was kindled by the signing of the Arusha Peace Agreement in August 2000 and , more recently , by the signing of a ceasefire between the Transitional Government and the three armed factions . We hope that the armed group that has remained outside of this peace process – the PALIPEHUTU / FNL – will soon join it . The Arusha Peace Agreement makes explicit reference to the rehabilitation of the educational and health sectors for the benefit of children , and there are plans to introduce peace education and tolerance programmes into school curricula . With respect to child soldiers , the Peace Agreement , as well as the ceasefire agreement signed on 2 December 2002 at Arusha with the FDD armed group , both define the ceasefire as , inter alia , the cessation of all acts of violence against the population as well as an end to the use of child soldiers and to sexual violence . The ceasefire agreement also specified in the annex – which is an integral part of the agreement – that the question of child soldiers is one of the technical issues still to be negotiated between the Government and the FDD , and that the Government and the rebel groups must agree on a common solution . Such a solution can be found in the disarmament , demobilization , reintegration and repatriation or resettlement programme , which is the most important part of the ceasefire agreement , and for which , thankfully , the international community has planned substantial funding , within the framework of a possible United Nations peacekeeping mission in Burundi . As concerns the Government , we recognize the existence of child soldiers recruited on a voluntary basis due to a lack of other options following unsuccessful primary schooling . In 1989 we signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child , and then , in 2001 , the Optional Protocol to that Convention on the involvement of children in armed conflict . Ratification proceedings are under way . We have already set up , jointly with the United Nations Children's Fund , a programme for the demobilization of child soldiers , and a census of these children is under way . However , with respect to the armed groups , the situation is quite distressing , because , following the signing of the ceasefire agreement on 2 December 2002 , the FDD rebels carried out a forced mass recruitment of young schoolchildren and students , promising them the world , including military ranks and large sums of money , which the international community was to give them if some of them were to be demobilized some day . This attitude should be condemned by the Security Council , because it is cynical , anachronistic and constitutes a violation of the ceasefire and of the agreed truce . Let me recall here that the Burundian armed groups are notorious for the horrific killing of children in boarding schools – the most infamous being the burning alive in 1993 of dozens of Kibimba Normal School students , as well as the slaughter of young seminarians in Buta in 1996 , who were killed in cold blood because they refused to group themselves by ethnicity , as had been ordered by the FDD rebel execution squad . The rebels also have excelled in the destruction of schools and hospitals , as well as in the kidnapping of schoolchildren and students under the age of 15 , with the goal of recruiting them or making them carry plundered goods . As the report points out , these actions are true war crimes , which , thankfully , the International Criminal Court plans to prosecute . The challenge raised by the situation of children in the Burundian conflict can be taken up now that the combatants seem to want to put an end to the war . Once the war has ended , the national and international community will be able to reweave the physical , social and moral fabric of the country . Children will once again be able to smile and to live a full and happy life with their parents – who themselves will welcome the chance to rebuild their lives in a reconciled nation . We ask the international community and the Security Council in particular to continue to help Burundi , so that it may continue forward on the path to peace . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Japan . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Ms. Saiga ( Japan ) : As all of us here will acknowledge with regret , the majority of victims and casualties in recent conflicts have been civilians , of whom the most vulnerable are children . Children are the most negatively affected by armed conflicts , as they are the victims of attacks , landmines and violence on the one hand , while being exploited as child soldiers on the other . We all bear responsibility for safeguarding the rights and welfare of children , who are the basis of the future development of any society . It is therefore commendable that the Security Council has regularly been taking up this important subject since 1998 . The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan , Yoriko Kawaguchi , is advocating what is referred to as the "" consolidation of peace "" , which is a new pillar of our foreign policy . This consolidation of peace includes a feature under which Japan would provide early support to local communities , before the achievement of any formal peace agreement . This initiative not only provides local people with assistance at a crucial time of need , but also gives critical momentum to the peace process by enabling them to enjoy the dividends of peace . That approach is more proactive than our conventional approach , which had focused on rehabilitation and the reconstruction of a country after the signing of a peace accord . Specifically , in order to ensure that children enjoy those dividends of peace , Japan has made a variety of concrete efforts to protect and assist children in situations of armed conflict . One example is the "" Back to School "" campaign in Afghanistan , which the United Nations Children's Fund has been advancing , with the financial support of Japan . Other examples of Japan's efforts in this area are school reconstruction and education reactivation in Kosovo , Timor-Leste and Côte d ' Ivoire ; assistance to internally displaced children in Somalia ; and landmine awareness education in Afghanistan , Angola and the Sudan , to name just a few countries . I should like , on behalf of the Japanese Government , to make a number of comments regarding the United Nations work on children and armed conflict . First , we would like to express our appreciation to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , Mr. Olara Otunnu , for his activities , including field visits to countries caught in or recovering from armed conflict , since such visits can contribute to the promotion of awareness of the importance of the protection of children in situations of armed conflict , who need special attention for their survival . The annex to the most recent report of the Secretary-General includes a list of certain parties to armed conflicts that recruit or use child soldiers . It is not sufficient simply to denounce those who are responsible , but every possible effort – for example , awareness raising and eradicating the culture of impunity – must be made to bring such practices to an end . Secondly , a number of United Nations agencies have been actively involved in the issue of children and armed conflict , including the Office of the Special Representative , field-based implementing agencies and various departments at Headquarters . In order for such agencies to use the limited resources available in an effective and efficient manner , inter-agency coordination and periodic review and streamlining of their activities are of great importance . Japan therefore welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 57 / 190 , entitled "" Rights of the child "" , which calls for a comprehensive assessment of the response of the United Nations system to the issue of children and armed conflict . It is hoped that concrete and bold ideas for the reform of United Nations activities in this area will be submitted , based upon achievements to date and changing needs on the ground . Thirdly , Japan is pleased that the Security Council has been regularly addressing the subject of children and armed conflict , as well as those of the protection of civilians in armed conflict and women , peace and security , as the issue of the protection of civilians , including women and children , is part and parcel of the maintenance of international peace and security . As my Government has frequently pointed out , however , the three subjects are intricately intertwined and thus should be addressed in an integrated manner . For instance , those three issues might well be addressed under a single agenda item . In conclusion , I am convinced that under your leadership , Mr. President , a resolution will be adopted that contributes to the improvement of the situation of children suffering as a result of conflict . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Namibia . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Andjaba ( Namibia ) : Permit me at the outset , Sir , to express my delegation's satisfaction at seeing see you presiding over the work of the Security Council this month , and to thank you for having convened this very important meeting . I would also like to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate the new members of the Council and to pledge my delegation's full support to them . Allow me also to pay tribute to the outgoing members of the Council for the excellent manner in which they participated in the Council's work over the past two years . I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his statement this morning and for his thought-provoking report , which reviews activities and progress made in the protection of children affected by situations of armed conflict . This report goes a step further than a mere review of the situation ; it provides a list of parties to armed conflict that recruit or use children in violation of relevant international obligations , and highlights the plight of children in conflicts that are not on the agenda of the Security Council . We see this step as a positive development in our efforts to protect the most vulnerable in our society . I wish to commend the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , Mr. Olara Otunnu , as well as Ms. Carol Bellamy , Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund , for the information that they provided today . Their tireless work and actions are clear testimony of their strong and unwavering commitment to protect children everywhere . It is encouraging to note from the report that impressive gains have been made in codifying international norms and standards for the protection and well-being of children . My delegation applauds this progress , since , as has been stated many times by the Council , the impact of conflict on children has severe implications , not only for peace and security , but also for socio-economic development . These positive developments should be built upon by the international community to ensure that children are forever protected against the consequences of war . Further efforts should be made to ensure that the standards according to which children are treated are implemented on the ground , and that permanent monitoring and reporting mechanisms are created in order to identify and adopt measures against violations . As responsible members of the international community , we must move with a great sense of urgency – and move beyond mere words . We must take concrete actions to practise what we preach . And we must not forget the children that are today suffering under foreign occupation and domination . Here , I speak of the children of Palestine and the children of Western Sahara . We must summon the necessary courage and political will to bring the suffering of those children to an end by ensuring that their countries attain their inalienable right to self-determination . The Security Council has a Charter responsibility in that regard . For its part , Namibia will continue to contribute to all efforts aimed at protecting future generations from the evils of armed conflict . It is for those reasons that Namibia was at the forefront in getting the Security Council involved in addressing the plight of children in armed conflict during our tenure in the Council in 1999 and 2000 . We therefore strongly supported resolutions 1261 ( 1999 ) and 1314 ( 2000 ) , which were adopted during that period . Resolution 1261 ( 1999 ) , in particular , heightened international attention with regard to this issue , which resulted in the progress that we are seeing today . Furthermore , we believe that the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child will have a profound impact that will contribute to achieving this goal . The provisions of the Optional Protocol will result in a sharp decrease in the number of young children recruited for war , and the Rome Statute will be a strong deterrent to war crimes such as sexual violence against children . Namibia strongly supports both instruments and will work tirelessly to ensure that their provisions are fully implemented . Other specific concerns of my delegation are the disproportionate impact of conflicts on girls and the devastation caused by HIV / AIDS . In many instances , the trauma of girls is compounded when they are infected with deadly diseases through sexual violence during times of war and peace . My delegation therefore urges the Security Council to continue to devote special attention to the needs of girls and to the effects of HIV / AIDS . Before I conclude , I wish to make an observation . The report before us ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , in paragraph 55 , mentions Namibia together with several other countries where the World Bank and other donors have committed themselves to give priority to the unconditional and urgent demobilization of child soldiers in a Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Programme for the Greater Great Lakes Region . The language of the paragraph , as it stands , could be misinterpreted to mean that Namibia also has child soldiers to be demobilized , although that is not directly stated . I should like to make it very clear that Namibia does not have or recruit child soldiers , because that is against the supreme law of our land , the Constitution of the Republic of Namibia . Finally , my delegation urges the Council to act expeditiously on the information provided to it in the report under discussion . The paramount consideration should be that more needs to be done to protect children from the scourge of war . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Ecuador . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Gallegos Chiriboga ( Ecuador ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : It is an honour to speak before you , Sir , representative of a friendly country such as France . At the same time , I should like to express my delegation's congratulations to the former President of the Council , the representative of Colombia , on his excellent work during his tenure . I should also like to congratulate the representatives of Angola , Chile , Germany , Pakistan and Spain , who have just joined the Council . First of all , I should like to express Ecuador's gratitude to the Secretary-General for his new and important report on children and armed conflict ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , in which he presents an account of activities undertaken and progress achieved related to that crucial issue during the period of the report . We express our congratulations to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict on his valuable initiatives and on the commitments reached in various countries in order to ensure the protection and well-being of children during and after conflicts , as well as compliance with obligations arising from international law . We encourage the Special Representative to continue to undertake all necessary efforts , in coordination with the competent bodies , to achieve increasingly significant results and commitments . It is also important to highlight – as the Secretary-General did in his report – the adoption by the General Assembly of the document "" A world fit for children "" , annexed to resolution S-27 / 2 , in which the Assembly agreed on a renewed commitment to protect children during armed conflicts , in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights law . The Security Council resolutions in that area and effective compliance with them are also important means to contribute to that objective . Other important advances in that sphere are the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict , as well as the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court , which ensures that the gravest significant crimes for the international community – among which are crimes committed specifically against children – will not go unpunished . The strengthening of international law in that sphere , respect for it and effective application of it are indispensable in order to guarantee the necessary protection for children , especially in the light of the persistence of conflicts of all kinds in various regions of the world . We also welcome the progress that has been made in the incorporation of the issue of the protection of children as an essential component of the work of peacemaking , peace-building and peacekeeping . One of the saddest and most tragic realities that we see in various parts of the world today is the unspeakable suffering experienced by the innocent and most helpless victims of society – children – as a result of armed conflicts . The report of the Secretary-General describes that intolerable reality , including the risks to which children are exposed as a result of landmines , unexploded ordnance and small arms and light weapons . It also discusses the serious situation of displaced children and the exploitation and abuses of every kind to which children are exposed . Therefore , the international community must accord high priority to the situation through the implementation of better concrete measures to guarantee children's most fundamental rights and to mitigate and prevent the pernicious effects that armed conflicts have on them . In his report , the Secretary-General also emphasizes the problems related to child soldiers . Nothing is more inhuman and more contrary to the highest values of any society than the fact that , instead of toys , children are forced or permitted to handle instruments of death ; that human beings , in the earliest stages of their existence , are dragged into violence , confrontation and destruction . The solution to this problem must , of course , be a United Nations priority . Ecuador wishes to note the list included in the Secretary-General's report , at the request of the Security Council , of the parties to armed conflict that recruit or use child soldiers , in violation of applicable international obligations . This is an important development , through which we no longer speak in general terms concerning the brutal realities that exist in various regions and fully identified areas . Instead , we are identifying specific parties , which will allow us to encourage State and non-State actors involved to alter their behaviour and to adhere to the basic norms of human rights and international humanitarian law . Although much remains to be done , the progress noted by the Secretary-General in his report on the issue of protecting children in armed conflict , while limited , is praiseworthy . We hope that it will continue and that the necessary efforts and actions will be stepped up in order to ensure that the world can truly become a place fit for children . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the Permanent Observer of Palestine . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Al-Kidwa ( Palestine ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : At the outset , let me express our great satisfaction at seeing you , Sir , preside over our Council . You are a skilful diplomat well known throughout the United Nations . I am pleased to see France , a friendly country , at the helm of the Council . Although Colombia is no longer a member of the Security Council , I should also like to take this opportunity to convey our thanks and appreciation to the friendly delegation of that country and to Ambassador Valdivieso for his presidency of the Council last month and to wish him every success . We also thank the former members whose membership lapsed at the end of the year , congratulate the new members and wish them every success . Over the past 28 months , the children of Palestine have been subject to systematic murderous action by Israel , the occupying Power . During this period , the occupying forces of Israel have committed war crimes and acts of State terrorism , as well as systematic violations of the rights of Palestinian children and of the Palestinian people in general . The occupying forces , both deliberately and through the indiscriminate or excessive use of force , have killed over 650 Palestinian children and wounded thousands more , hundreds of whom have been permanently disabled . Through the use of force , widespread destruction and the collective punishment of the entire Palestinian community , the occupying forces have also inflicted psychological disorders and emotional and social damage on huge numbers of Palestinian children . Above all , Israeli measures and practices have impoverished Palestinian children , who consequently suffer malnutrition and lack of health care , and have halted and destroyed the educational system , leading to the spread of ignorance among future generations . All of this is occurring against the backdrop of Israel's ongoing occupation of our land for over 35 years , during which the occupying forces have not only oppressed and suppressed the population , but have also practised settler colonialism , one of the worst possible war crimes . The settler colonialism , which denies our people's rights to exist and survive and to national independence , further inhibits the Palestinian child's right to a natural and normal future , such as that enjoyed by any child throughout the world . To all of this we must add Israel's uprooting of half our population – including children and women – from their lands and homes since 1948 and its prevention of their return for over 50 years . We can thus realize the magnitude of the great humanitarian crisis and plight of Palestinian children at the hands of the leaders and forces of Israel , who are war criminals and the colonialists of the twentieth century . The efforts of the Security Council in the field of children and armed conflict complement the great work of the General Assembly . In this respect , we express our appreciation for the efforts of the General Assembly in addressing the situation of Palestinian children . The Israeli Chargé d ' affaires , with all his well-known arrogance , earlier attacked and criticized the General Assembly resolution concerning Palestinian children . Only four members , whom I shall not name , voted against that resolution . It may be possible in a professional context for the representative of the occupying Power to seek to defend the illegal and illicit behaviour of his country , but it is intolerable and disgusting that he should try to tell Member States what to do and to portray the occupying Power as a State that obeys and observes international law and loves peace . We welcome the improvement of the Security Council's position concerning the question of children and armed conflict through its acceptance of the legal necessity of addressing the issue of children under foreign occupation . This logically leads to the issue of Palestinian children under Israeli occupation . We also welcome the improvement of the Secretary-General's report in this context and the reference made therein to Palestinian children and their suffering , although the reference inadequately covers all the essential aspects of the issue . The same can be said of the statement made this morning by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict , Mr. Olara Otunnu , in which he added to the relevant paragraph of the Secretary-General's report another paragraph on the use of suicide bombings in Israel . Although we do not disagree in principle , we nevertheless do not understand part of the text in that additional paragraph . More important , we believe that the two paragraphs do not clearly reflect either the situation or its legal aspects ; nor do they reflect the tragic situation experienced by Palestinian children for many years now . Nevertheless , this is a beginning that we hope will develop in an appropriate manner , including a visit by the Special Representative to occupied Palestinian lands , including Al-Quds Al-Sharif . We convey our welcome to him in advance . We hope that the Security Council will take the steps needed to provide the necessary protection for Palestinian children living under Israeli occupation , not only in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its relevant Optional Protocol but also with the legal commitments emanating from the Fourth Geneva Convention – which must be respected in all circumstances , as must its Additional Protocol I. The President ( spoke in French ) : The representative of Israel has asked to speak . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Mekel ( Israel ) : I regret that I am forced to take the floor again in this debate . We had hoped that this discussion would not turn into an exchange regarding the particularities of the situation in the Middle East . Unfortunately , that has not been the case . In the course of today's debate , a few speakers – in particular the Palestinian observer – have used the issue of children in armed conflict to single out Israel for criticism and condemnation . Such criticism directed at one country , and at one country alone , is not intended to alleviate the situation facing Palestinian children or , for that matter , the situation facing any group of children living under the threat of armed conflict . Rather , it is intended to advance a political agenda and to isolate my country . For that reason , I am compelled to make a second intervention . The situation facing the Palestinian people , including Palestinian children , is a serious one . Israel shares the concern of the international community over their plight and has taken steps to improve the humanitarian situation of all Palestinians . It must be stressed , however , that this situation is first and foremost a product of the decision of the Palestinian leadership to engage in violence , to pursue confrontation in place of negotiations and to encourage , finance and support a deliberate campaign of terrorism against the people of Israel . While it may be convenient to place full blame for the plight of the Palestinian people on Israel's shoulders , the fact remains that the Palestinian leadership , which chose to forego a viable political process in favour of a bloody campaign of terrorism , is primarily responsible for the difficult situation we are currently facing . Israel has never , and will never , intentionally target Palestinian children or any unarmed civilian . We recognize that , in the course of our battle with Palestinian terrorists , civilians have suffered . Those cases are deeply regrettable ; but , in contrast to Palestinian terrorists who have deliberately targeted school buses , discos and other areas where children are known to congregate , Israel has gone to great lengths – and at considerable risk to its own security – to ensure that its counter-terrorist operations are conducted so as to reduce the threat to civilians as much as possible . Those who are genuinely concerned about the situation of Palestinian children must scrutinize and condemn the criminal behaviour of Palestinian terrorists , who have obscured the fundamental distinction between civilians and combatants , set up camps in civilian refugee areas , used Palestinian civilians , including children , as human shields and used private homes and schools as bases from which to launch attacks against Israel , in grave violation of international humanitarian law and Security Council resolutions . The international community must loudly condemn the practices of Palestinian leaders , who have actively encouraged the participation of Palestinian children in armed conflict , elevated suicide terrorists to the status of national heroes and urged children to follow their examples . If delegations truly care about Palestinian children , they must first and foremost address the shameful practices of Palestinian leaders and terrorists that have led too many Palestinian children to believe that murder and death are noble pursuits . However , if their purpose is simply to exploit another United Nations discussion to attack and defame Israel , let those delegations find a more appropriate forum . On an issue as urgent and critical as protecting children , we can ill afford to allow our discussions to be tainted by such naked political hostility . The President ( spoke in French ) : The representative of Rwanda has asked to speak . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Gasana ( Rwanda ) ( spoke in French ) : A moment ago , the Permanent Representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo made an attempt to confuse the members of the Council . Fortunately , absurdity never killed anybody . The representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo sought to sully and to tarnish Rwanda's image by saying that Rwanda had sent 20,000 prisoners to the Democratic Republic of the Congo . I would like to say to the Council that that was a lie , pure and simple . I would ask everyone present here not to take the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo seriously . The Security Council should not be a forum for insults . The President ( spoke in French ) : The Permanent Observer of Palestine has asked for the floor . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Al-Kidwa ( Palestine ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : I am sorry to once again take up the Council's precious time , but I would like to make the following brief points in response to the second intervention by the Israeli representative . First , any attempt by Israel to depict its criminal acts against our people as a reaction to acts of violence by Palestinians is a false attempt . Suffice it for me to refer to the continuation of the occupation for more than 35 years and to the transfer by Israel of 400,000 settlers to that land , in grave violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and many Security Council resolutions , in order to occupy the land and to prevent the Palestinians from exercising their rights . The occupation , its abhorrent practices and settler colonialism are what led to the violent reaction by our people , not the contrary . Secondly , Israel's claims that it has mitigated the suffering of our people are ridiculous . I need only refer to the report of the Secretary-General on the humanitarian situation . Thirdly , the claim that Israel , the occupying Power , has not targeted civilians or children is also a lie . When an Israeli warplane drops a one-ton bomb on a residential area of Gaza , that act constitutes a deliberate murder of civilians . Two days ago , when an Israeli helicopter fired a missile at a certain car in a highly populated area in Gaza , resulting in the death of two children , aged 14 and 15 , it was a deliberate murder of civilians . Israel , the occupying Power , has deliberately murdered civilians through the excessive and indiscriminate use of force . Fourthly , the representative of Israel claims that the Palestinian side uses its children as human shields . That is very racist , as well as unacceptable . It reflects a sick mentality . We hope that Israel's representatives and leaders will overcome such thinking in the future . Finally , we once again hope that the international community will truly stand up against the culture of illegal impunity by confronting the war crimes and all other crimes committed by the leaders of Israel as part of the official State policy of successive Israeli Governments , particularly in the last 28 months . We hope such a stance will be taken because it is the only thing that could lend real credibility to the statements of the international community on this issue . Despite all this , we have not yet lost hope for changing both the situation and the Israeli policy and for reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the region , based on two States , Palestine and Israel , living side by side . The President ( spoke in French ) : I now give the floor to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , Mr. Olara Otunnu , to respond to comments in a brief intervention , given the lateness of the hour . Mr. Otunnu : I have taken very careful note of the extremely important comments and critiques made by members of the Security Council and other Members of the United Nations . I shall be in continuing dialogue with them , and I shall do everything possible to act on the suggestions and proposals which have been made . At this late hour , I do not intend to respond or to elaborate on any specific suggestion or proposal . Thank you very much , Sir , for your interest and engagement and the commitment of the Security Council . The President ( spoke in French ) : I now give the floor to the Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund , Mr. Kul Gautam , to respond to comments made in a brief statement , given the lateness of the hour . Mr. Gautam : It is late in the day , Sir , as you said , so I will try to be brief . This open debate of the Security Council has been enormously encouraging to us at UNICEF . On behalf of Carol Bellamy , our Executive Director , I would like to thank all Member States that have so generously acknowledged UNICEF's work in the demobilization and reintegration of children in situations of armed conflict in many countries . We will convey your words of appreciation and encouragement and your sense of solidarity to our field staff , who work day in and day out to try to help children in difficult circumstances . I know it will be a tremendous inspiration to them . I would also like to take this occasion to acknowledge and pay a special tribute to our non-governmental organization partners . There are very few of them left here . But I know that there is a large number of them outside , watching the proceedings of the Council . Their work and collaboration are of tremendous value to the work of the United Nations . We could not be as effective as we are without their passion , support and solidarity . As many delegations highlighted , prevention is better than cure . A major contribution by UNICEF and our partner organizations to ensure that all children are helped to enjoy childhood to their full potential requires investing in basic services and reaching the Millennium Development Goals , which are very important for the development of children . We were particularly happy to hear so many delegations referring to the commitment that our leaders made to "" A world fit for children "" . Indeed , if we can implement some of the goals , targets and objectives of "" A world fit for children "" , we will do well for children in difficult circumstances , in armed conflict and otherwise . Let me mention just two or three specific things that we take to heart . Several delegations reminded us that the illicit traffic in small arms contributes enormously to violence . We share their concerns and hope that there will be a stronger response in that area . We are encouraged by the comments made by many delegations on the need to ensure that the list in the annex to the Secretary-General's report is developed , strengthened , expanded , reviewed and made more of a practical tool . We hope that these statements will be reflected in the Council's resolution , when it is adopted in the next few days . Many delegations made specific suggestions and recommendations for the follow-up to the Secretary-General's report . Austria , speaking on behalf of the Human Security Network , made 10 very specific and concrete proposals . We trust that some of those very specific and pertinent points will be reflected in the draft resolution that the Council is to adopt in the next few days . The Council's debate today , and the draft resolution that it will soon adopt , will provide powerful encouragement and support for all of us to redouble our efforts to protect children from the barbarity of armed conflict and to help them build , and live in , a more peaceful world – a world that is fit for children . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund for his statement . There are no further speakers inscribed on my list . The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda . The meeting rose at 7.55 p. m . This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages . The final text will be printed in the Official Records of the Security Council . Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only . They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service , room C-154A ."	0
165	"One thing the world needs , one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates . We need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument . ( Applause ) If you think about the arguments we have , most of the time it 's shouting matches on cable television , ideological food fights on the floor of Congress . I have a suggestion . Look at all the arguments we have these days over health care , over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street , over the gap between rich and poor , over affirmative action and same-sex marriage . Lying just beneath the surface of those arguments , with passions raging on all sides , are big questions of moral philosophy , big questions of justice . But we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics . So what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion . First , let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality , give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens , Aristotle's theory of justice , and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today . So , are you ready for the lecture ? According to Aristotle justice means giving people what they deserve . That 's it ; that 's the lecture . ( Laughter ) Now , you may say , well , that 's obvious enough . The real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why . Take the example of flutes . Suppose we 're distributing flutes . Who should get the best ones ? Let 's see what people -- What would you say ? Who should get the best flute ? You can just call it out . ( Audience : Random . ) Michael Sandel : At random . You would do it by lottery . Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them . Who else ? ( Audience : The best flute players . ) MS : The best flute players . ( Audience : The worst flute players . ) MS : The worst flute players . How many say the best flute players ? Why ? Actually , that was Aristotle's answer too . ( Laughter ) But here 's a harder question . Why do you think , those of you who voted this way , that the best flutes should go to the best flute players ? Peter : The greatest benefit to all . MS : The greatest benefit to all . We 'll hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players . That 's Peter ? ( Audience : Peter . ) MS : All right . Well , it 's a good reason . We 'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music . But Peter , Aristotle does n ' t agree with you that that 's the reason . That 's all right . Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players . He said , that 's what flutes are for -- to be played well . He says that to reason about just distribution of a thing , we have to reason about , and sometimes argue about , the purpose of the thing , or the social activity , in this case , musical performance . And the point , the essential nature , of musical performance is to produce excellent music . It 'll be a happy byproduct that we 'll all benefit . But when we think about justice , Aristotle says , what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing . One of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy , but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians . Now , flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case . Let 's take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice . It had to do with golf . Casey Martin -- a few years ago , Casey Martin -- did any of you hear about him ? He was a very good golfer , but he had a disability . he had a bad leg , a circulatory problem , that made it very painful for him to walk the course . In fact , it carried risk of injury . He asked the PGA , the Professional Golfers' Association , for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments . They said , "" No. Now that would give you an unfair advantage . "" He sued , and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court , believe it or not , the case over the golf cart . Because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated , provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity . He says , "" I 'm a great golfer . I want to compete . But I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next . "" Suppose you were on the Supreme Court . Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case . How many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart ? And how many say , no , he does n ' t ? All right , let 's take a poll , show of hands . How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin ? And how many would not ? How many would say he does n ' t ? All right , we have a good division of opinion here . Someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart , what would be your reason ? Raise your hand , and we 'll try to get you a microphone . What would be your reason ? ( Audience : It 'd be an unfair advantage . ) MS : It would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart . All right , those of you , I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage . What about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart ? How would you answer the objection ? Yes , all right . Audience : The cart 's not part of the game . MS : What 's your name ? ( Audience : Charlie . ) MS : Charlie says -- We 'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply . Tell us , Charlie , why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart ? Charlie : The cart 's not part of the game . MS : But what about walking from hole to hole ? Charlie : It does n ' t matter ; it 's not part of the game . MS : Walking the course is not part of the game of golf ? Charlie : Not in my book , it is n't . MS : All right . Stay there , Charlie . ( Laughter ) Who has an answer for Charlie ? All right , who has an answer for Charlie ? What would you say ? Audience : The endurance element is a very important part of the game , walking all those holes . MS : Walking all those holes ? That 's part of the game of golf ? ( Audience : Absolutely . ) MS : What 's your name ? ( Audience : Warren . ) MS : Warren . Charlie , what do you say to Warren ? Charley : I 'll stick to my original thesis . ( Laughter ) MS : Warren , are you a golfer ? Warren : I am not a golfer . Charley : And I am . ( MS : Okay . ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , it 's interesting . In the case , in the lower court , they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue . Is walking the course essential to the game ? And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer . And what do you suppose they all said ? Yes . They agreed with Warren . They said , yes , walking the course is strenuous physical exercise . The fatigue factor is an important part of golf . And so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart . Now , notice , something interesting -- Well , I should tell you about the Supreme Court first . The Supreme Court decided . What do you suppose they said ? They said yes , that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart . Seven to two , they ruled . What was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we 've just had is that the discussion about the right , the justice , of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf . And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question . And Justice Stevens , writing for the majority , said he had read all about the history of golf , and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few strokes as possible , and that walking was not essential , but incidental . Now , there were two dissenters , one of whom was Justice Scalia . He would n ' t have granted the cart , and he had a very interesting dissent . It 's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion . He said it 's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf . Here 's how he put it . "" To say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object . But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement , ( Laughter ) that is , what distinguishes games from productive activity , ( Laughter ) it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential . "" So there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion . Justice Scalia's opinion is questionable for two reasons . First , no real sports fan would talk that way . ( Laughter ) If we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary , rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring , we would n ' t care about the outcome of the game . It 's also objectionable on a second ground . On the face of it , it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart -- an argument about fairness , what 's an unfair advantage . But if fairness were the only thing at stake , there would have been an easy and obvious solution . What would it be ? ( Audience : Let everyone use the cart . ) Let everyone ride in a golf cart if they want to . Then the fairness objection goes away . But letting everyone ride in a cart would have been , I suspect , more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA , even than making an exception for Casey Martin . Why ? Because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf , but , relatedly , the question , what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents ? Let me put the point as delicately as possible : Golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game . ( Laughter ) After all , there 's no running or jumping , and the ball stands still . ( Laughter ) So if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart , it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer , the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes . That illustrates that with golf , as with flutes , it 's hard to decide the question of what justice requires , without grappling with the question "" What is the essential nature of the activity in question , and what qualities , what excellences connected with that activity , are worthy of honor and recognition ? "" Let 's take a final example that 's prominent in contemporary political debate : same-sex marriage . There are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman , and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage . How many here favor the first policy : the state should recognize traditional marriage only ? And how many favor the second , same-sex marriage ? Now , put it this way , what ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage ? The opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage , fundamentally , is procreation , and that 's what 's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging . And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no , procreation is not the only purpose of marriage . What about a lifelong , mutual , loving commitment ? That 's really what marriage is about . So with flutes , with golf carts , and even with a fiercely contested question like same-sex marriage , Aristotle has a point . Very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition . So let 's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , elevate , the terms of political discourse in the United States , and for that matter , around the world . There is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics , that 's a recipe for disagreement , and for that matter , a recipe for intolerance and coercion . So better to shy away from , to ignore , the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life . It seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite , that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life , rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter . That , it seems to me , is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument . Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . Thanks . Thank you . Chris . Thanks , Chris . Chris Anderson : From flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage . That was a genius link . Now look , you 're a pioneer of open education . Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big . What 's your vision for the next phase of this ? MS : Well , I think that it is possible . In the classroom , we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions . And I think we can do that in public life more generally . And so my real dream would be to take the public television series that we 've created of the course -- it 's available now , online , free for everyone anywhere in the world -- and to see whether we can partner with institutions , at universities in China , in India , in Africa , around the world , to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate . CA : So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of conversation , inviting questions , but with people from China and India joining in ? MS : Right . We did a little bit of it here with 1,500 people in Long Beach , and we do it in a classroom at Harvard with about 1,000 students . Would n ' t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing , engaging seriously with big moral questions , exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup , students in Beijing and Mumbai and in Cambridge , Massachusetts and create a global classroom . That 's what I would love to do . ( Applause ) CA : So , I would imagine that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor . Michael Sandel . Thank you so much . ( MS : Thanks so much . ) </content"	0
1542	- Will there be less time for shared family activities and attention for the members due to the new business venture ? How great a time loss would the members be willing to accept ? - Are all the family members ready and eager to launch this business and believe it will be a success ? Are the family members aware that the new business might not reach its financial goal or even fail which is a frequent occurrence with new businesses ? - How long a time span does the family think should be allowed for the business to remain a going concern if it is not living up to expectations and not generating enough or any revenue ? If that happens , should it simply be shuttered or should there be an attempt to sell it off ? - Is there a contingency plan in the event that the new business goes under ? Not all of these questions will yield immediate and thoroughly thought out answers before the business goes into operation or until it has been operating for a while . Many things can change that will impact the new business so it is helpful to go back over this list with the family members roughly twice a year to see if there are new opinions or additional input from the members . Your family needs to feel connected and supportive of your new business plan or there can come a day when the family unit can break down . Most people do not want to lose their family to divorce or alienation because they allowed themselves to become obsessed with an idea or business plan . The odds of your business succeeding are far more favorable if your family stands behind you cheerfully and optimistically . Be sure to give your family a chance to speak their minds and respect their opinions before taking those first steps on your new business path .	0
388	Deafness : the facts Hearing aids How do I get a hearing aid on the NHS ? How do I get a hearing aid on the NHS ? If you are having difficulty hearing and think you might benefit from hearing aids , visit your family doctor , who may refer you to an audiology ( hearing aid ) department depending on local arrangements and what other symptoms you may have . Do n't forget to mention all possible relevant symptoms to your GP and specialist , for example , if you are experiencing noises in the ear or having difficulties with balance . All NHS ENT and Audiology departments will have a waiting period . If your GP refers you to an audiologist , you will go on a waiting list for an appointment . UK citizens and residents are entitled to free hearing aids through the NHS . However , if you are in a hurry to get aids , or want a particular type of aid that is not available through the NHS , an alternative is to go to a private hearing aid dispenser or audiology department . Some NHS audiology clinics have links with private clinics and may be able to offer guidance , or you can contact the Deafness Research UK Information Service . Before your first audiology appointment It is best to take the person you have the most conversation with along too , particularly if you are worried about being able to hear the audiologist . This will help the audiologist adjust the hearing aid to the voice you hear most often , and you will both understand the process involved in getting , using and adjusting to , your hearing aid . Ask the audiologist to speak slowly and more clearly if you can not hear them . Think about which situations you have trouble hearing in . For example , one-to-one , watching television , hearing when you are with several friends , certain types of voices ? What to expect at your first appointment It will be explained what tests you are having . It will be explained if you need a hearing aid in one or both ears and why . Your audiologist will write down the name and type of hearing aid you are getting , and whether it is a digital or analogue aid . Your audiologist will show you your audiogram and explain the extent of your hearing loss . Your audiologist will show you how to care for your aid and how it works . Initial testing At your first audiology appointment , your medical history will be taken , your ears will be examined and your hearing tested . The main test is to find out the quietest sounds that you can hear at different pitches or frequencies , presented either over earphones or via a vibrator attached to your head . Additionally , a detailed questionnaire of your listening needs will normally be carried out . These simple tests will determine whether you need one hearing aid or two . If you need an aid , an impression of your ear will be taken , which will be used to create your earmould for your hearing aid . You will return several weeks later to get your aid fitted . At the initial appointment you will be asked a list of questions about your hearing to help determine how best to adjust your aid for different situations . Ask your audiologist to print out a copy for you so that you are able to monitor the situations where you have difficulty hearing . Keep a list of all the different situations you have difficulty hearing in and tell the audiologist at your fitting appointment . The more information you can give the audiologist about the different situations that you have difficulty hearing in , or hear well in , the better they will be able to adjust the hearing aid for your individual needs . Fitting Once your hearing aid is ready , you will return for a fitting appointment . Most people will receive one hearing aid , but in some cases the type of hearing loss ( bilateral ) makes it more beneficial for the patient to receive two aids . However , resource limitations mean that not everyone who would benefit from two hearing aids will get them . Your aid will be chosen to suit the degree and type of hearing loss you have . You will be shown how to put in the earmould . You will also be shown how to operate the controls and how to change the batteries . Your audiologist will help you to manage your hearing loss , improve your communication skills and enable you to participate fully in daily activities . Follow up care You will have a follow-up appointment around 6 to 12 weeks after your fitting appointment . Here you can discuss any problems you may be experiencing and any necessary adjustments will be made to the earmould and / or the programming of the hearing aid . For example , you may still have trouble hearing individual voices in noisy situations , or the aid may be amplifying sound too much in some situations . At this appointment , you may also get further information about getting used to , and looking after , the hearing aid . After your follow-up appointment you will not normally be sent another audiological appointment unless you request one . However , some audiology departments conduct a routine follow up after a period of one or two years . If you are not happy with the sounds the hearing aid produces and this is stopping you using it in all the situations you want to , you should request another appointment to make further adjustments to your hearing aid . Ongoing support You do n't usually need an appointment to get new hearing aid batteries . Check with your local department when facilities are available as opening times can vary . These are supplied free of charge from your local audiology department and may be available from local GP surgeries and health centres . If you have ongoing problems adjusting to your hearing aid , check if there is a hearing therapist in your area . They can offer ongoing support in helping you to manage your hearing loss , improve your communication skills and enable you to participate fully in daily activities . You can be referred by your family doctor or check with your local audiology department . If your hearing aid or earmould needs repairing you may or may not need an appointment , depending on local policy .	7
174	"So I want to talk today about an idea . It 's a big idea . Actually , I think it 'll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that 's emerged in the past century . It 's the idea of computation . Now , of course , that idea has brought us all of the computer technology we have today and so on . But there 's actually a lot more to computation than that . It 's really a very deep , very powerful , very fundamental idea , whose effects we 've only just begun to see . Well , I myself have spent the past 30 years of my life working on three large projects that really try to take the idea of computation seriously . So I started off at a young age as a physicist using computers as tools . Then , I started sort of drilling down , thinking about the computations I might want to do , trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from and how they could be automated as much as possible . Eventually , I created a whole structure based on symbolic programming and so on that let me build Mathematica . And for the past 23 years , at an increasing rate , we 've been pouring more and more ideas and capabilities and so on into Mathematica , and I 'm happy to say that 's led to many good things in R and D and education , lots of other areas . Well , I have to admit , actually , that I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica . I wanted to use it myself , a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope 400 years ago . But I wanted to look , not at the astronomical universe , but at the computational universe . So we normally think of programs as being complicated things that we build for very specific purposes . But what about the space of all possible programs ? Here 's a representation of a really simple program . So , if we run this program , this is what we get . Very simple . So let 's try changing the rule for this program a little bit . Now we get another result , still very simple . Try changing it again . You get something a little bit more complicated , but if we keep running this for awhile , we find out that , although the pattern we get is very intricate , it has a very regular structure . So the question is : Can anything else happen ? Well , we can do a little experiment . Let's just do a little mathematical experiment , try and find out . Let 's just run all possible programs of the particular type that we 're looking at . They 're called cellular automata . You can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here . Most of them do very simple things . But if you look along all these different pictures , at rule number 30 , you start to see something interesting going on . So let 's take a closer look at rule number 30 here . So here it is . We 're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here , but we 're getting all this amazing stuff . It 's not at all what we 're used to , and I must say that , when I first saw this , it came as a huge shock to my intuition , and , in fact , to understand it , I eventually had to create a whole new kind of science . ( Laughter ) This science is different , more general , than the mathematics-based science that we 've had for the past 300 or so years . You know , it 's always seemed like a big mystery how nature , seemingly so effortlessly manages to produce so much that seems to us so complex . Well , I think we 've found its secret . It 's just sampling what 's out there in the computational universe and quite often getting things like Rule 30 or like this . And knowing that , starts to explain a lot of long-standing mysteries in science . It also brings up new issues though , like computational irreducibility . I mean , we 're used to having science let us predict things , but something like this is fundamentally irreducible . The only way to find its outcome is , effectively , just to watch it evolve . It 's connected to , what I call , the principle of computational equivalence , which tells us that even incredibly simple systems can do computations as sophisticated as anything . It does n ' t take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation , just something that happens , naturally , all over the place . Things with rules as simple as these can do it . Well , this has deep implications about the limits of science , about predictability and controllability of things like biological processes or economies , about intelligence in the universe , about questions like free will and about creating technology . You know , working on this science for many years , I kept wondering , "" What will be its first killer app ? "" Well , ever since I was a kid , I 'd been thinking about systematizing knowledge and somehow making it computable . People like Leibniz had wondered about that too 300 years earlier . But I 'd always assumed that to make progress , I 'd essentially have to replicate a whole brain . Well , now I got to thinking : This scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different . And , by the way , I 've now got huge computation capabilities in Mathematica , and I 'm a CEO with some worldly resources to do large , seemingly crazy , projects . So I decided to just try to see how much of the systematic knowledge that 's out there in the world we can make computable . So , it 's been a big , very complex project , which I was not sure was going to work at all . But I 'm happy to say that it 's actually going really well . And last year we were able to release the first website version of Wolfram Alpha . It 's purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine that computes answers to questions . So let 's give it a try . Let 's start off with something really easy . Hope for the best . Very good . Okay . So far so good . ( Laughter ) Let 's try something a little bit harder . Let's say ... Let 's do some mathy thing and with luck it 'll work out the answer and try and tell us some interesting things things about related math . We could ask it something about the real world . Let's say -- I do n't know -- What 's the GDP of Spain ? And it should be able to tell us that . Now we could compute something related to this , let 's say the GDP of Spain divided by , I do n't know , the -- hmmm ... let 's say the revenue of Microsoft . ( Laughter ) The idea is that we can sort of just type this in , this kind of question in however we think of it . So let 's try asking a question , like a health related question . So let 's say we have a lab finding that -- you know , we have an LDL level of 140 for a male aged 50 . So let's type that in , and now Wolfram Alpha will go and use available public health data and try to figure out what part of the population that corresponds to and so on . Or let 's try asking about , I do n't know , the international space station . And what 's happening here is that Wolfram Alpha is not just looking up something ; it 's computing , in real time , where the international space station is right now , at this moment , how fast it 's going and so on . So Wolfram Alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things . It 's got by now , pretty good coverage of everything you might find in a standard reference library and so on . But the goal is to go much further and , very broadly , to democratize all of this kind of knowledge , and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas , to be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have , not by searching what other people may have written down before , but by using built in knowledge to compute fresh new answers to specific question . Now , of course , Wolfram Alpha is a monumentally huge , long term project with lots and lots of challenges . For a start , one has to curate a zillion different sources of facts and data , and we built quite a pipeline of Mathematica automation and human domain experts for doing this . But that 's just the beginning . Given raw facts or data to actually answer questions , one has to compute , one has to implement all those methods and models and algorithms and so on that science and other areas have built up over the centuries . Well , even starting from Mathematica , this is still a huge amount of work . So far , there are about 8 million lines of Mathematica code in Wolfram Alpha built by experts from many , many different fields . Well , a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language , which means that we 've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them . And I must say that I thought that step might just be plain impossible . Two big things happened . First , a bunch of new ideas about linguistics that came from studying the computational universe . And second , the realization that having actual computable knowledge completely changes how one can set about understanding language . And , of course , now with Wolfram Alpha actually out in the wild , we can learn from its actual usage . And , in fact , there 's been an interesting coevolution that 's been going on between Wolfram Alpha and its human users . And it 's really encouraging . Right now , if we look at web queries , more than 80 percent of them get handled successfully the first time . And if you look at things like the iPhone app , the fraction is considerably larger . So , I 'm pretty pleased with it all . But , in many ways , we 're still at the very beginning with Wolfram Alpha . I mean , everything is scaling up very nicely . We 're getting more confident . You can expect to see Wolfram Alpha technology showing up in more and more places , working both with this kind of public data , like on the website , and with private knowledge for people and companies and so on . You know , I 've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one a sort of whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge-based computing , in which one 's starting , not just from raw computation , but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge . And when one does that , one really changes the economics of delivering computational things , whether it 's on the web or elsewhere . You know , we have a fairly interesting situation right now . On the one hand , we have Mathematica , with its sort of precise , formal language and a huge network of carefully designed capabilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines . Let me show you a couple of examples here . So here 's a trivial piece of Mathematica programming . Here 's something where we 're sort of integrating a bunch of different capabilities here . Here we 'll just create in this line a little user interface that allows us to do something fun there . If you go on , that 's a slightly more complicated program that 's now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on . But it 's something that 's very precise stuff . It 's a precise specification with a precise formal language that causes Mathematica to know what to do here . Well , then on the other hand , we have Wolfram Alpha , with all the sort of messiness of the world and human language and so on built into it . So what happens when you put these things together ? I think it 's actually rather wonderful . With Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica , you can , for example , make precise programs that call on real-world data . Here 's a really simple example . You can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have Wolfram Alpha figure out what you 're talking about . Let 's try this here . But actually I think sort of the most exciting thing about this is that it really gives one the chance to democratize programming . I mean , anyone will be able to just sort of say what they want in plain language , then , the idea is , that Wolfram Alpha will be able to figure out what precise pieces of code can do what they 're asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger , precise programs . So , sometimes , Wolfram Alpha will be able to do the whole thing immediately and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with . So here 's a big website where we 've been collecting lots of educational and other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things . So , I do n't know , I 'll show you one example , maybe here . This is just an example of one of these computable documents . This is probably a fairly small piece of Mathematica code that 's able to be run here . Okay . Let 's zoom out again . So , given our new kind of science , is there a general way to use it to make technology ? So , with physical materials , we 're used to kind of going around the world and discovering that particular materials are useful for particular technological purposes and so on . Well , it turns out , we can do very much the same kind of thing in the computational universe . There 's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there . The challenge is to see how to harness them for human purposes . Something like Rule 30 , for example , turns out to be a really good randomness generator . Other simple programs are good models for processes in the natural or social world . And , for example , Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica are actually now full of algorithms that we discovered by searching the computational universe . And , for example , this -- we go back here -- This has become surprisingly popular among composers finding musical forms by searching the computational universe . In a sense , we can use the computational universe to get mass customized creativity . I 'm hoping we can , for example , use that even to get Wolfram Alpha to routinely sort of do invention and discovery on the fly and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff that no engineer and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with . Well , so , that leads to sort of an ultimate question . Could it be that someplace out there in the computational universe we might find our physical universe ? Perhaps there 's even some quite simple rule , some simple program for our universe . Well , the history of physics would have us believe that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated . But in the computational universe we 've now seen how rules that are incredibly simple can produce incredibly rich and complex behavior . So could that be what 's going on with our whole universe ? If the rules for the universe are simple , it 's kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level , operating , for example , far below the level of space or time , which makes it hard to represent things . But in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid . Well , then the universe has to evolve by applying little rules that progressively update this network . And each possible rule , in a sense , corresponds to a candidate universe . Actually , I have n ' t shown these before , but here are a few of the candidate universes that I 've looked at . Some of these are hopeless universes , completely sterile , with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space , no notion of time , no matter , other problems like that . But the exciting thing that I 've found in the last few years is that you actually do n't have to go very far in the computational universe before you start finding candidate universes that are n ' t obviously not our universe . Here 's the problem : Any serious candidate for our universe , is inevitably full of computational irreducibility , which means that it is irreducibly difficult to find out how it will really behave , and whether it matches our physical universe . A few years ago , I was pretty excited to discover that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce special relativity and even general relativity and gravitation and at least give hints of quantum mechanics . So , will we find the whole of physics ? I do n't know for sure . But I think at this point it 's sort of almost embarrassing not to at least try . Not an easy project . One has got to build a lot of technology . One 's got to build a structure that 's probably at least as deep as existing physics . And I 'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is . Build a team , open it up , offer prizes and so on . But I 'll tell you here today that I 'm committed to seeing this project done , to see if , within this decade , we can finally hold in our hands the rule for our universe and know where our universe lies in the space of all possible universes -- and be able to type into Wolfram Alpha "" the theory of the universe , "" and have it tell us . ( Laughter ) So I 've been working on the idea of computation now for more than 30 years , building tools and methods and turning sort of intellectual ideas into millions of lines of code and grist for server farms and so on . With every passing year , I realize how much more powerful the idea of computation really is . It 's taken us a long way already , but there 's so much more to come . From the foundations of science to the limits of technology to the very definition of the human condition , I think computation is destined to be the defining idea of our future . Thank you . ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : That was astonishing . Stay here . I 've got a question . ( Applause ) So , that was , fair to say , an astonishing talk . Are you able to say in a sentence or two how this type of thinking could integrate at some point to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explanations of the universe ? Stephen Wolfram : Well , the parts of physics that we kind of know to be true , things like the standard model of physics . What I 'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics or it 's simply wrong . The things that people have tried to do in the last 25 years or so with string theory and so on have been an interesting exploration that has tried to get back to the standard model , but has n ' t quite gotten there . My guess is that some great simplifications of what I 'm doing may actually have considerable resonance with what 's been done in string theory , but that 's a complicated math thing that I do n't yet know how it 's going to work out . CA : Benoit Mandlebrot is in the audience . He has also shown how complexity can arise from a simple start . Does your work relate to his ? SW : I think so . I view Benoit Mandlebrot's work as kind of one of the founding contributions to this kind of area . Benoit has been particularly interested in nested patterns , in fractals and so on , where the structure is something that 's kind of tree-like , and where there 's sort of a big branch that makes little branches , and even smaller branches and so on . That 's kind of one of the ways that you get towards true complexity . I think things like the Rule 30 cellular automaton get us to a different level . In fact , in a very precise way they get us to a different level because they seem to be things that are capable of complexity that 's sort of as great as complexity can ever get ... I could go on about this at great length , but I wo n ' t . CA : Stephen Wolfram , thank you . ( Applause ) </content"	3
173	"Good morning . Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all , Leonardo da Vinci . We 're all familiar with his fantastic work -- his drawings , his paintings , his inventions , his writings . But we do not know his face . Thousands of books have been written about him , but there 's controversy , and it remains , about his looks . Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians . So what do you think ? Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or is n't it ? Let 's find out . Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him . He drew people , anatomy , plants , animals , landscapes , buildings , water , everything . But no faces ? I find that hard to believe . His contemporaries made faces , like the ones you see here . En face or three quarters . So surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time . So let 's try to find them . I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits , we would find his face looking at us . So I looked at all of his drawings , more than 700 , and looked for male portraits . There are about 120 , you see them here . Which ones of these could be self-portraits ? Well , for that they have to be done as we just saw , en face or three-quarters . So we can eliminate all the profiles . It also has to be sufficiently detailed . So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized . And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome , even beautiful man . So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures . ( Laughter ) And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill . And here they are . Yes indeed , the old man is there , as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianos . And lastly , the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted , "" The Musician . "" Before we go into these faces , I should explain why I have some right to talk about them . I 've made more than 1,100 portraits myself for newspapers , over the course of 300 -- 30 years , sorry , 30 years only . ( Laughter ) But there are 1,100 , and very few artists have drawn so many faces . So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces . OK , now let 's look at these three portraits . And hold onto your seats , because if we zoom in on those faces , remark how they have the same broad forehead , the horizontal eyebrows , the long nose , the curved lips and the small , well-developed chin . I could n ' t believe my eyes when I first saw that . There is no reason why these portraits should look alike . All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait , and look , they are very similar . Now , are they made in the right order ? The young man should be made first . And as you see here from the years that they were created , it is indeed the case . They are made in the right order . What was the age of Leonardo at the time ? Does that fit ? Yes it does . He was 33 , 38 and 63 when these were made . So we have three pictures , potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time . But how do we know it 's him , and not someone else ? Well , we need a reference . And here 's the only picture of Leonardo that 's widely accepted . It 's a statue made by Verrocchio , of David , for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15 . And if we now compare the face of the statue , with the face of the musician , you see the very same features again . The statue is the reference , and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces . Ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published . It 's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first . The icon of icons finally has a face . Here he is -- Leonardo da Vinci . ( Applause ) </content"	0

21	"The China Question President Bush's recent visit to Asia made little news – by design . But that 's because Bush did n't begin to address the issue that is looming ever larger in the region : the changing face of security in Asia in view of China's growing economic and military might . This summer , for example , China and Russia conducted their first-ever grand-scale joint military exercise . This was followed by Russian news reports that China , Russia , and India would conduct trilateral military exercises , named "" Indira 2005 , "" on the same scale before the end of this year . In the past , such a combination of countries was almost unthinkable , and these exercises can not be explained away as simple "" one-off "" affairs with little resonance . Instead , they reflect China's long-term strategic goal of establishing hegemony across Asia . One tool of this ambition is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) , under which the Sino-Russian exercises took place . Established in June 2001 , the SCO includes China , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan . The SCO's original purpose was to mitigate tensions on the borders of China and the Central Asian countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the arrival of the United States military with the war in Afghanistan . China regards the SCO as a stage for broadening its influence over a vast region , ranging from the Asia-Pacific to Southwest Asia , the Middle East , East Africa , and the Indian Ocean . Indeed , its members include about 45 % of the world's population , and 28 % of the landmass ranging across the Eurasian continent . China's active leadership of the SCO has resulted in policies that it favors . Gradually , the SCO shifted its focus to fighting Islamic radicals . Nowadays , however , the SCO is often used as a forum to campaign against supposed American unilateralism and to provide a united front – especially between China and Russia – against the US with respect to security and arms-reduction issues in the region . This includes joint anti-terror training and demands to reduce US forces in the region , particularly from Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan . The SCO provides China not only with a platform to confront the existing US-led alliance in the Asia-Pacific region , but is increasingly being used to prevent the formation of a US-led network to restrain China's advance . Ultimately , it is feared that the SCO could develop into a military alliance similar to the Warsaw Pact of the Cold War era , with an embryonic "" Great China Union "" at its core . But China's regional diplomacy goes far beyond the SCO . It seizes every opportunity that comes its way , including the Six Party Talks on North Korea's nuclear ambitions , to emphasize its centrality to the settlement of any and all Asian issues . Moreover , it continues to build its "" string of pearls "" of military bases at every key point on maritime transportation routes along the "" arc of instability "" from the Middle East to China's coast . No one seems to know how to respond to China's diplomatic and military muscle flexing in Asia , for the extent of China's ambitions remains utterly unclear . But , while everyone else ponders China's motives , its government is acting . Indeed , the UK's premier security think tank , the Institute for International Strategic Studies , recently warned that , while the world focuses on the fight against international terrorism and the unfolding events in the Middle East , China is rapidly expanding its influence from Asia to Africa . The "" pearls "" in Africa include Sudan , Angola , Algeria , Gabon , Namibia , Zambia , Tanzania , Zimbabwe , Uganda , Djibouti , Mali , Central Africa , Liberia , Ethiopia , Mozambique , Sierra Leone , and the Democratic Republic of Congo . In each country , China is nurturing special military and commercial relations intended to promote loyalty to Chinese interests . As in Asia , there is a pattern at work : growing Chinese influence begets increased support for Chinese policies . Of course , it 's a two-way street . Whenever complaints come up in the United Nations' Human Rights Committee , China can count on the support of many African countries that have their own human rights problems . Even the selection of Beijing as the site of the 2008 Olympics benefited from "" African votes . "" And China has publicly stated that it will back African nations in potential disputes at the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) and other international organizations . Similarly , many African states now seem to be leaning heavily toward China in its dispute with Taiwan . When Japan's government tried to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council , few African countries backed its bid , despite receiving economic aid for decades . China likes to boast of its "" peaceful rise . "" But the rise of Bismarck's Germany at the end of the nineteenth century was also peaceful – for a while . The question is not whether China rises to great-power status peacefully , but whether it intends to remain peaceful when it gets there . Just as the world confronted the "" German Question "" 125 years ago , it is now confronting the "" China Question . "" We need a better answer this time ."	0

861	A report by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog has said that Iran is forging ahead with nuclear enrichment , despite international objection . The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , which has been inspecting Iran's programme , said there is evidence that Iran is already proceeding with full-scale enrichment . The Agency ' s director has called this development ' a matter of concern ' , which is certain to intensify the row over Iran's nuclear ambitions . What 's all the fuss about ? The current dispute dates back to 2003 , when the IAEA reported that Iran had hidden an enrichment programme for18 years . This discovery led some Western countries to suspect that Iran is using its enrichment programme to develop atomic weapons . Many countries believe that Iran should not be allowed to have nuclear weapons and have called for Iran to abandon its programme . Iran has refused to do so – prompting a series of crises and the present inspections . Why is the West worried – many countries have nuclear weapons ! Absolutely . Some of Iran's biggest critics , including the US , Britain and Israel , are nuclear powers . However , these countries believe that Iran would use nuclear weapons to attack another country – something they claim they would never do . They point to the Iranian President's recent call for the destruction of Israel as evidence of Iran's aggressive agenda . What does Iran say ? Iran has always maintained that its nuclear programme is designed for civilian purposes , that is for producing energy and fuel , and it insists it has every right to do so . Iran has repeatedly said that it has no intentions to develop nuclear weapons , let alone use them against another country . Iranian officials have also dismissed the anti-Israel remarks as a matter of opinion , not policy . What happens now ? The report will be forwarded to the United Nations Security Council , which could impose sanctions . At this point , it is not likely that the crisis will escalate much further , although some commentators fear it will lead to military action in the future . The latest report is certain to spark another debate about the right to develop nuclear weapons . Should Iran be allowed to pursue its enrichment programme ? Have your say in the Being Heard forum	0

644	"Dear Ishmael Please may I thank you for the children's celebration on Wednesday ( ? ) of Week 1 of Spring Harvest this year : the celebration at which you and others prayed for healing for those there . I was there and I was healed . I have n't told anyone about this yet , because for the past couple of weeks I 've been too scared to hope that it could really be true . But it is . I was standing at the back , because a botched operation on my knee when I was 13 had left me with a weak right leg and a small degree of disability . All that standing up and sitting down the previous couple of evenings had been a bit too much . I was also feeling fairly vulnerable , because I 'd just had a row with my chalet-mates . God uses some strange ways to prepare us for meeting Him . One person spoke about depression , and I wondered if that could be for me , but it did n't feel ' right ' - I 've suffered from depression , but am coping with it quite well right now . Then ( I think it was ) you said that someone had a pain , or a problem , with their right leg . And what I heard was , "" Jesus wants to heal you . "" Jesus actually WANTS to heal me . I do n't think anyone saw but I just stood at the back of the room and could n't stop the tears pouring out . I do n't have the words to describe what I felt , or how I fell now in remembering it , but I was completely overwhelmed . I walked out of the room , to go to the Big Top celebration , limping as I usually do – and then I realised that I did n't need to limp . I tried out walking like other people walk – and I was walking evenly , and without pain . I was so scared I almost went straight back to the chalet , to hide . I do n't know from what . After the celebration I walked through the site , not wanting to go ' home ' – just wanting to walk , to see if I could make it hurt again . I could n't . I work out at the gym a lot , on medical advice ( I certainly do n't torture myself for fun ! ) . Walking the treadmill has been agony – I 've simply had to work through the pain , because it 's something I am required to do by my doctor . Since getting back from Spring Harvest , I 've been to the gym almost every day , and have never once felt any of the pain I used to live with all the time . My right leg is weak and gets tired , but I can see even that starting to change now . THERE IS NO MORE PAIN ! I 'm still frightened to believe it , in case it turns out not to be true . But it is true , is n't it ? Which is why I want to thank you , in completely inadequate words . After 29 years , I can walk freely again . I am not a good person ( I have some nasty stuff in my past that Jeff , who is surely one of the kindest and most compassionate people I 've ever met , is helping me sort out ) , but Jesus has stepped right into where it hurt and He has healed me . I do n't understand it – I certainly do n't deserve it – but it 's happened . I think I 've caught a glimpse of what Paul means when he talks about praising God continually . I suppose I should tell people , but I do n't know how . I 'm afraid they wo n't believe me – my disability was not always particularly marked . But I know it 's true , and my gratitude to Jesus is without measure . I do n't know yet how to thank Him , but I shall find a way . Thank you as well . Thank you so much ."	1
802	Stem cells are notable for being fecund -- they continually generate new cells . So too do cancer cells , however . Indeed , stem cells and cancer cells are beginning to seem very close relations . In one recent study , adult stem cells ( those obtained from mature animals , rather than early embryos ) were found to develop into tumour cell lines when grown in the laboratory . A team from Spain collected stem cells from fat tissue and grew them in culture for eight months . Some developed into cells that generated cancers when injected into animals . In a second study , a Danish team found that permanently activating telomerase in similar stem cells also made them cancerous . Telomerase protects the ends of chromosomes , which usually wear away at every cell division . Telomerase can prolong the lifespan of a cultured cell line , but leaves it vulnerable to uncontrolled proliferation . Studies of certain cells obtained from breast cancers are also disturbing . These cells can seed new breast cancers , and look very much like stem cells . Finally , Carla Bender Kim and colleagues recently identified a ' pocket ' in the adult mouse lung containing stem cells . As well as providing new lung epithelial cells , these cells can be triggered to proliferate by cancer-causing mutations . These and other studies highlight the perils as well as the potential of cellular immortality . They also raise questions about the use of adult stem cells in therapy . Rubio D et al.

Remember that a "" good "" KEI is anything over 100 , and an "" excellent "" KEI is anything over 400 . Let 's be honest here . You could manage a top 10 for this keyword phrase with your eyes closed ( and your computer turned off ) . So , for our aromatherapy client , we could create a page on the various techniques of massage , including ( of course ) her oils and aromatherapy products . We would spend time on the page and give it true value to both the engines and the target audience . And , we would subtly add graphics and link text that points to the client's products in various areas of the page . John gave another example He says , "" If you 're selling ' digital cameras , ' do n't optimize for ' digital cameras . ' Did you know that everyone is searching for ' Digital Cameras Review ' ? Build a page offering reviews of digital cameras , which has a KEI that just blew me away . "" Another effective strategy : Top Reports Besides Comprehensive Search , John also likes to look at the top reports for high performance keywords or topics that are related to his client . John explains , "" I 'll review the Long Term Reports , which are the top 1000 keywords over the past 24 hours . Then , I cut and paste any topics related to my client into Comprehensive Search to get streams of currently ' hot topics . ' I define a hot topic as a popular topic in high demand , which may also have lists of related keywords phrases also in high demand . "" What happens if you ca n ' t find a hot topic that relates to your site in the top 1000 ? John answers , "" Many people do not know that Wordtracker offers extensive top word reports beyond the database . All you have to do is ask , and they 'll sell you : * The Top 20,000 words $ 99 * The Top 100,000 words $ 500 * The Top 500,000 words $ 2000 "" Additional suggestions * When John goes to Comprehensive Search , he does n ' t put in a huge list of keyword phrases . He types in one single word , then lets Comprehensive Search do the rest . This allows him to come up with ideas and angles that he would have never considered before . * Like John , spend a lot of time thinking of your target audience . Who are you trying to sell the products or services to ? There may be several target audiences , as in the case of our aromatherapy example . If so , go after keyword choices to target each of those audiences . * Do n't be afraid to let your creativity take hold . If your first few choices do n't work , continue trying . Using Comprehensive Search , it does n ' t take long to go back through the system with a different keyword idea . Keep going back until you find a possibility that might work for your site or the site of a client . * Be sure to give the surfer what they 're looking for when they choose your site from the search results . If you promised them "" techniques of massage , "" then be sure to give them good , solid content in that area , including related links . Weave your products and services throughout the page as you can . But , do n't ever try to trick a surfer . * If you get stuck and just ca n ' t find a keyword phrase with a high KEI and a low level of competition that will work for you , take a slightly different approach . Instead of trying to bring in a large amount of traffic through one single window , try creating several windows and bring in a little traffic through each one . Though more time consuming , this strategy can be equally effective in the long run . * If you are n ' t already a member of Wordtracker ( http://www.wordtracker.com ) , sign up for the free trial and test the system out for yourself . Pricing is very reasonable , depending on your needs . For example , you can use the service for a week for $ 19.94 , and many other plans are available . The bottom line is this : if you are serious about your Web site , you 've got to be serious about keyword choice . If you 're serious about keyword choice , Wordtracker is a "" must have "" service for you .
