19,"Contributions <p/> More and more new and renovated housing is being built in a low-energy or even passive house concept. Low-energy buildings, and in particular passive buildings, are residential buildings whose primary purpose is to minimise energy consumption. <p/> By definition, a house should be low-energy when its heating energy demand is less than 50 kWh/(m ² a) and passive when it is less than 15 kWh/(m ² a). In practice, it may even be less than 10 kWh / (m ² a). <p/> Several factors are important for a building to reach these standards. The correct location and orientation, as well as the use of the right structures and materials, must be taken into account in the design and construction. <p/> The aim of this type of construction should be to minimise the energy used to heat and cool the building. <p/> This means that the following conditions must be met in the most efficient way possible: <p/> - use of solar energy directly through glass surfaces and indirectly through solar collectors for the production of domestic hot water, <p/> - the primary energy source for this type of building is the sun. However, in truth, we have to admit that in our region there are not many sunny days in winter. Therefore, on those days when the outside temperature is around 0°C or even lower, such facilities also need an additional source of energy. <p/> Most often, the additional source is a heat pump, which heats the building and provides the necessary amount of domestic hot water on cold days without solar radiation. <p/> As modern and technically sophisticated as heat pumps are, they also have drawbacks. As the ambient air temperature decreases, their efficiency decreases and the direct energy consumption increases. Another dilemma is what happens in the event of a power failure, which can sometimes last for a day or more. In this situation, this type of facility is completely helpless. <p/> All the above-mentioned devices - solar panels, heat pump and ventilation - are then useless. The very serious question is what to do in such a situation? <p/> One option is to use a solid fuel local heating system. But what kind? The building has a small, very meagre heat demand and all local solid fuel stoves are designed for a minimum of 6 kW and more. Such an installation would turn the building into a sauna, as the room temperatures would be significantly too high. But there is an answer, and that is a clay stove or a SMALL CLAY STOVE. <p/> 1 - Outside air inlet <p/> 2 - Fire door with glass <p/> 3 - Automatic combustion air inlet control <p/> 4 - Manual combustion air inlet control <p/> 5 - Fireclay combustion chamber - firebox <p/> 6 - Secondary combustion air inlet <p/> 7 - Afterburner zone <p/> 8 - Flue gas passage to flue ducts <p/> 9 - Fireclay flue ducts - 3m long <p/> 10 - Pottery lining <p/> 11 - Connection at top <p/> 12 - Connection at rear <p/> Most people think of a pottery stove as an artisan-built heating appliance, It is a stove heated with wood and heats one or at most two living spaces. We think of a rustic room, a mountain hut or a living room with a ceramic stove that warms the room in a cosy way. But in reality, the earthenware stove is an element that offers much more, because the possibilities of design and use of earthenware stoves in terms of design and thermal engineering are extremely wide. <p/> With the introduction of new living standards and the consequent construction of buildings with lower energy consumption, the need for individual solid fuel heating appliances of smaller size and power has become apparent. Manufacturers of earthenware stoves have identified a niche market and have adapted their products to this part of the market. We have developed so-called ""SMALL IRON STOVES"", which have the same characteristics as conventional designs, with the difference that they are smaller in terms of dimensions and heat output. <p/>Where are the advantages and why do customers choose such stoves? <p/> There is an increasing trend towards smaller living units and low-energy buildings where energy consumption is minimal and conventional solid fuel heating appliances are simply too powerful. <p/> Heat outputs of 1.2 - 3.0 KW using 3 to 5 kg of firewood per fire are ideal for this type of building. <p/> The operation of the combustion in the firebox is therefore completely independent of the room air. The combustion air can be controlled either manually or automatically. In the latter case, the microprocessor controls the air supply to the firebox via a control damper. <p/> The method of heat transfer by gentle radiation of the ceramic surfaces offers the most suitable solution in terms of health, comfort and convenience for man. As the proportion of convective heat transfer is lower due to the low surface temperatures, the movement of warm air through the room is also less intense, resulting in less dust particles being raised. This fact is particularly important for people with various allergies. <p/> The ability of fireclay materials to accumulate heat allows for a long heating cycle of up to 12 hours. This means loading firewood twice a day and thus very easy operation. <p/> Due to the modern technically sophisticated construction of the firebox and flue and thus the perfect combustion technique, the efficiency of the stove is very high, over 85, which means a low consumption of firewood and thus cheaper heating and less landfill. <p/> The perfect combustion results in high temperatures in the firebox, which means higher efficiency and more favourable emissions. <p/> The lifetime of such a stove is very long (at least one generation), which means that the investment is very rational. A long-term investment in a reliable, environmentally friendly and low-cost heating method. Maintenance and operation is simple. Wood biomass is used as the energy source, which is the most ecologically advantageous yet the cheapest. The glass fire door allows visual contact with the flame, which attracts people and offers them additional comfort.Installation is quick and clean. <p/> Design is also very important. In addition to the dimensional and design specificities, all stoves have a choice of glazing colours or colour combinations. With a choice of different glaze combinations, each customer can choose the colour idea that suits them. This gives each kiln a completely individual character tailored to the wishes and needs of the customer and makes it completely unique. <p/> And there is one more thing <p/> Every stove is an ornament and a decorative element in a room. In addition, firing and operating a tiled stove is a very special and enjoyable task. What makes it special is the pleasant radiation of heat through the walls of the stove and the many functional possibilities. The wood-burning fire is pleasantly felt through the open fireplace door, and fire has remained a source of heating from prehistoric times to the present day. Burning wood gives us a feeling of relaxation. It is a special ritual that is the same for each of the earthenware stoves. In each hearth, a large amount of energy is released when the fire is lit. This is stored in the fireclay mass of the earthenware stove and radiates into the room as a gentle, soft heat for hours afterwards. <p/> The heater operates independently of the electricity in the house or the oil in the tank. Pot stoves cover the need for heat in the way that ancestors once did. This is still the case today, and will continue to be the case long after oil and gas are long forgotten sources.",Promotion of a Product,test
23,"Beans <p/> Related <p/> Superfood <p/> Historically, beans have actually been highly valued, but then important high-class chosen ones, such as Catherine de Medici, decided that beans were a peasant food that was not elegant and special enough for their stomachs. They replaced it with the trend of processed food, which is still not rooted today. <p/> Meat of the rich <p/> Hence the now-famous saying that beans are the poor man's meat, which is no longer true since experts believe that animal protein causes many diseases. For a while, beans were accused of not having as complete a protein composition as meat. It is true that it lacks two amino acids, but it is not difficult to compensate for them if beans are combined with foods that contain them, such as cereals. So you can pour bean sauce over couscous, and more recent findings show that it is not even necessary to consume this combination in the same meal - it is enough to consume all the amino acids in the same day. <p/> (Not) sophisticated? <p/> The reputation of beans as not being a sophisticated food is certainly due to the problems they occasionally cause. Many argue that if legumes are consumed regularly and in small quantities, they disappear. You may also find some of the natural recipes suitable. Look for dried kombu seaweed in health food shops. Add them to the water in which you soak the beans. The algae will not affect the taste of the beans and will almost disintegrate during cooking. Besides, there is nothing wrong with algae particles floating around on the plate. The more familiar bay leaf should have a similar effect, and some people recommend chewing half a teaspoon of aniseed immediately after a meal or at the onset of flatulence. <p/> Easy to prepare <p/> Although there are many types of beans, all of them, from broad beans to white or black beans, cook in a very similar way, just adjust the time to the size of the bean. Always remove any unusually shaped, discoloured or broken beans first. There must also be no holes, however small, in the beans, as they are invisible 'inhabitants' to our eyes. <p/> This will not happen if the beans are stored in a well-sealed ceramic or glass container. It can wait for a year, but do not mix old and new stocks, as the beans will then cook for different lengths of time. Salt, lemon juice, vinegar, wine or tomatoes should not be added before the end of cooking as they slow down the softening of the beans. <p/> Most IN <p/> Due to their easier digestibility, mung beans and adzuki beans have recently become the most popular types. Due to their smaller size, they only need to be soaked for a few hours and cooked for one hour. Season with turmeric, basil, thyme or coriander. Adzuki is known as the sweetest and least 'beany' type of bean. In Japan, where it is said to be native, it is used to make milk and desserts. Most often, the beans and sugar are boiled into a filling. <p/> Both types of bean can be ground into flour. They are highly recommended in Chinese medicine for women, especially during menstruation and lactation, and are said to strengthen the bladder and kidneys and to give courage and energy. <p/> Both types of beans can be sprouted, but mung beans are best known in this form: their sprouts are called soya beans. Interestingly, the sprouts contain vitamin C, which beans do not. To produce your own, soak the beans overnight and then place them in a suitable container in a warm, dark but airy place, making sure they are kept wet at all times. It is not recommended to eat the sprouts raw, so fry them in coconut fat and season them with soy sauce. According to Chinese medicine, mung beans are supposed to cool and detoxify the body, and to relieve inflammation. <p/> The basis of a healthy diet <p/> You can play around with soups, sauces, stews, spreads, purees and salads, but don't forget the spices. You can always add parsley, savory, sage or marjoram to beans. Add a little vinegar to your dishes to make them even tastier. In the end, beans will really prove to you that even a healthy dish can be tasty and cheap. <p/> VIVIN TIP <p/> Superfood <p/> If you soak beans in cold water and cook them very slowly, they retain virtually all their nutritional value. Beans contain zinc, iron, copper, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, manganese and selenium, as well as B vitamins. Folate lowers levels of homocysteine, the build-up of which in the walls of blood vessels causes the risk of cardiovascular disease. Fibre from beans helps to eliminate bad cholesterol from the body. Beans even contain substances that prevent certain cancers. It has a good effect on blood sugar due to its low glycaemic index and is also very beneficial for people with high blood pressure (with the exception of canned beans). And it can be eaten even if you are constipated. In addition, harmful substances from the environment do not get further than the pod.",Instruction,test
29,"First memory book <p/> A first memory book is the most beautiful gift at the birth of a child. New subscribers to My Toddler magazine receive it as a gift! <p/> How quickly it's forgotten which baby name suggestions were made by mummy and which by grandma, exactly when baby first rolled over on his side, which toy was his favourite at eight months, who came to celebrate his first birthday, what the toddler called the bottle when he was very small.... Wouldn't it be nice to capture some of those sweet memories forever? <p/> Baby Memory Book <p/> When there is a baby or a young child in the house, young parents certainly have no time to spare. That's why many young parents don't even think of writing down the small and big events of their baby's earliest years, because they are so tired every day that they can hardly wait for a good night's rest. And yet... How quickly childhood passes and how we love to go back to it! Little bigger children want to know everything about their early childhood - what toys they played with, what shoes they wore, what their first bedding was like... We could listen to stories about this for hours. But it's amazing how quickly these tiny everyday details slip from parents' and grandparents' memories! <p/> And it's not just the little kids, teenagers and adults alike love to go back to their first childhood. It is as if they want to reconstruct a time that they remember only vaguely, only in a hunch. It is only when their parents or grandparents put it into words for them with their own memories that they seem to have linked their feelings and memories into events that make sense and can be explained. The satisfaction they feel in doing so is certainly worth the effort of writing and editing their first memory book. Why not give it to them? Such memories bind adults and children together with a warm bond of love, knowing how much we have always loved them and also - what they have done for us over the years. Isn't that worth writing a line here and there in the first memory book or sticking a photograph in it? <p/> Support for parents What should we write in the first memory book? No, the problem is not that nothing important happened in the baby's life. Too much is happening, because in the first year a baby grows from an almost helpless newborn into a toddler who is already taking his first steps. And in the next year he starts to talk more and more, and better and better, and by the age of three he can do almost ""everything"" - talk, run, fall asleep on his own, catch and throw a ball, draw... The child just needs to deepen and sharpen his knowledge. There is indeed much to write about in the first three years of a child's earliest childhood. <p/> The first memory book is therefore designed so that in each month from birth to the child's third year, the developmental path of the average child is described - his physical development, his motor development, the development of his ability to communicate, etc. And then there is enough space to write down, for each month, information about your own child, an exceptional, beloved and inimitable individual. It is not a question of comparing the average child, or what a child 'should' already know, with our own child, because every child is an inimitable being who is loved for who he or she is, not for what he or she has already achieved. Each child develops at his or her own pace and has every right to do so. The description of developmental characteristics covers only what is common to all children. What young parents want to know is what they can expect in the coming months. <p/> The average developmental characteristics of each month of infant and child age will give parents enough support to also assess what is worth writing about their child. In addition, there is enough space in the first memory book to stick baby's photos, first drawings, descriptions of first funny events, a list of birthday party invitees and so on. <p/> What was it like when I was little? They hardly speak, children want to know what it was like when they were little. They are not at all bothered by the thought that they are, in fact, still small. And they are right - why not look forward to every new step in their development? Just watch a child proudly comparing their 'big' hand with the tiny handprint and sole you have glued in their first memory book! A photo of his first cot will spark a conversation about how he used to sleep and how big he is now. And the photo of him lying next to his first teddy bear will remind you how tiny his body used to be... Children will also love looking at their memory book because each page features cute and playful characters from his childhood - teddy bears, ladybirds, butterflies, elves, Santa Claus, pets... <p/> Jealousy of the baby Such memories, written in the book and in the photographs, can also help a child facing the arrival of a baby brother or sister, a baby who is not difficult to be jealous of because he or she needs so much love and care from their parents. In the conversation around his first memoir, we can show him that, even though he is now a ""bigger"" child, he needed and received all that love and attention too. Perhaps it will be easier for the child to understand that a sibling will one day be as big and independent as he or she is now, that he or she will become a playmate and companion. <p/> If we also write and furnish the baby's first memory book for a sibling, the older child will be able to keep up-to-date with how his or her sibling is developing. Parents will also benefit from such a comparison, because it is nice to know that a child's development always ends the same way, even if at times the moments seem to drag on forever, and at other times time seems to pass at an unbearable speed. <p/> First time at sea, first Christmas and New Year... Children find it difficult to understand the dimension of time - what was six months ago and what will be two years from now. They live primarily in the present moment, which is why it is so difficult for them to wait, even if ""just a little"". At three years old, last summer, when we were at the seaside, seems infinitely far away. Don't be surprised if he doesn't remember anything more than if he had never been to the seaside at all. Because for him, last summer really is very far away. It happened in the previous third of the child's life. If you are thirty years old, that would mean to you that it happened ten years ago... Joking aside. It's much easier for children (and adults too) to reminisce when they see photographs. That's why the first memory book has a special space dedicated to records and photos of your child's first Christmas and New Year, first trip to the seaside and first birthday. Looking at the photos together often brings back memories that you have not kept, but that grandma or grandpa, or sometimes the child, may surprise you and tell you something else that can take you back to happy times. <p/> A gift for a child or grandparent? You can also write and furnish your first memory book almost in secret. Perhaps one day you could give it to your child as a very special gift, telling him or her how much you have always loved him or her and how much you have cared for his or her happiness. You could give it to your child when they come of age, when they get married or when their first child is born. <p/> Or your first memory book can be a nice gift for your grandparents. It will be nice if you write it and give it to them already completed. Or you can give it blank, unfilled. Grandparents usually have more time than a young family, and they are very eager to have contact with their child. They may enjoy filling out their first memory book. The grandparents will also find the record of their child's development in the book helpful, because many grandparents, after many years of being young parents themselves, have forgotten what it is like to have a baby and how babies develop into toddlers. It is a great pleasure for them to recall this old knowledge, and also the memories of their own children that come to mind. <p/> A gift at birth It is also a good idea to give a first memory book to the parents-to-be or the new parents. You don't always have to give knitted slippers and two bodysuits, and there are bound to be a few teddy bears before the new parents can buy the first one to their liking. It is much better to be original and give a first memory book that the young family will enjoy for years after they have received it. <p/> Get your first memory book as a gift with a new subscription to My Toddler magazine.",Promotion of a Product,test

45,"World No Tobacco Day this year over advertisers Smoking kills six million people worldwide every year, and in Slovenia it takes 3,600 lives annually. On World No Tobacco Day, there are warnings about the dangers of smoking, including second-hand smoke. The horrifying statistics that six million people die every year from smoking worldwide, 600 000 from passive smoking, and 3 600 lives are lost annually in Slovenia, 900 of them under the age of 60, speak for themselves. If we do not change our tobacco use patterns, as many as one billion people will die from tobacco in the world in the 21st century. <p/> Worldwide, 1.3 billion people smoke. If smoking were reduced by between 20 and 25 per cent, as many as 100 million premature deaths would be prevented by 2020. This makes it one of the most preventable deaths, but efforts are still lacking because the tobacco industry holds the reins. <p/> Stop the tobacco industry's marketing! The theme of this year's World No Tobacco Day, first proclaimed by the World Health Organization in 1987, is Stop Tobacco Marketing! Helena Koprivnikar from the Institute for Health Protection of the Republic of Slovenia warns that marketing is one of the most important causes of the spread of tobacco use and that urgent action is needed to prevent and reduce the prevalence of smoking among adolescents and young adults and to complement measures to reduce smoking among adults. In the European Union, 70% of smokers start smoking before the age of 18. <p/> According to the Institute for Health Protection, 24% of the population aged 15-64 in Slovenia smokes, more men (27%) than women (21%). The proportion of male smokers has been increasing in recent years, mainly at the expense of the proportion of female smokers. The proportion of adolescents and young adults who smoke is largely stable, but the proportion of adolescent women who smoke has increased. Among adolescents aged 11-15, just over 29% have tried smoking, more boys than girls. <p/> New Tobacco Directive with tougher restrictions The European Union is currently negotiating a proposal for a new Tobacco Directive that would completely ban the advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products. This includes the introduction of large composite warnings, which would include colour photographs in addition to text and would cover 75% of the front and back of cigarette packs and rolling tobacco. It also provides for a ban on the sale of tobacco products with distinctive flavourings and additives that give the impression that the tobacco product is less harmful to health. <p/> European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Tonio Borg, urged Members of the European Parliament and European Health Ministers to support the proposal for a new Tobacco Products Directive and stressed the importance of efforts to reduce the attractiveness of smoking and tobacco products to young people. <p/> Free smoking cessation programmes in Slovenia Nataša Blažko from the Ministry of Health said that Slovenia is a strong supporter of the new directive as tobacco is a major burden in Slovenia, explaining that the proposal brings changes in a number of areas, but also adds new areas, such as the treatment of electronic and herbal cigarettes. The Ministry of Health financially supports various programmes aimed at preventing young people from starting to smoke and at smoking cessation in all population groups. Slovenia is one of the few countries where primary health care provides free smoking cessation programmes. B. T.

""She is thinking of Brigitta of Sweden, the mystical wife and great saint whose daughter was St Catherine of Sweden, or Karin, whom the Church remembers today. <p/> Karin was the fourth of Brigitta's eight children. She was born in 1331 or 1332. She was put into a convent early on to be brought up. At her father's request, she married a pious nobleman when she was only fourteen. The young couple decided to imitate the virginal marriage of the Blessed Virgin and Saint Joseph. Catherine began to dress simply and without excessive jewellery. Her example was imitated by many young ladies, her friends. Her mother, Brigitta, went to Rome after her husband's death and lived a pious life there. Catherine's desire for Rome was also aroused. Her husband defended her at first, but finally gave her permission. Because of his illness, he was unable to accompany her. She came to Rome in 1349, when she was eighteen. She was happy to embrace her mother again. Soon, however, she felt very homesick and was about to return home. At her mother's request, she declared that she was ready to leave everything and stay in Rome for Christ's sake, but she soon came to despise Rome outright and asked her mother's permission to return to Sweden after all. Brigitta considered her daughter's wish a dangerous temptation, and she began to pray. Christ appeared to her and said, ""Tell your daughter that she is already a widow. Convince her to stay. I will take care of her. ""After a long time, Catherine found inner peace. Her mother's spiritual director also guided her, and under his guidance she progressed in virtue because she was obedient to him in everything. She made several pilgrimages with her mother, including one to the Holy Land in 1372. They both had a kind of monastic life, in which prayer, work, rest and charity were interspersed. Her mother Brigitta, in a vision, was ordered to found a new order with its first monastery in Vadstena, Sweden, as early as 1346. She also drew up the rules of the order, which is called the Order of Brigitta or the Order of the Saviour, but it was not until her daughter Catherine that her idea could be realised. <p/> Shortly after her return from the Holy Land, her mother died in Rome on 23 July 1373. According to her will, Catherine transported her body to Sweden, where it was solemnly buried in the monastery church in Vadstena. The nuns of this monastery lived according to the rules of her mother and elected Catherine as superior. But after only a year, she travelled to Rome to seek the leadership of the Catholic Church to have Brigitta declared a saint. She spent five years gathering the necessary material, then returned to Vadstena, where the bishop confirmed her as superior, and she began to prepare for her death: she died on 24 March 1381. Her canonization was confirmed by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484, and her mother Brigitta was declared a saint in 1391.",Information/Explanation,test
78,"Advent is a time of anticipation. Preparations for this year's Christmas are upon us. Preparation requires a certain amount of cooperation and commitment on our part. We do not wait with our arms crossed. Only children behave like that, not knowing what to do and therefore bored. If I personally want to prepare for the holiday and also get the most out of the holiday, then I have to make a programme of what I want to achieve and then work hard to really achieve the goals I have set. I will not dwell on those for whom Christmas is just a nice family holiday, when they are at home more, when they are doing the gift-giving, when they are perhaps having a Christmas holiday together on the white slopes, but we will not see them in church for the holidays because they have no faith, or because they think they have done enough by putting up a Christmas tree and an artistic nativity scene at home. I will leave aside those things that have no connection with the Christian faith and instead dwell on the Slovenian traditional Christmas celebration. What goals can I set myself in preparation for Christmas? For some, Christmas will be a time to reminisce about old times, to think about childhood and time with parents and family traditions. So they will put up the nativity scene and the Christmas tree, bless the premises in the old way, say a prayer and have a good dinner. At midnight, they will probably attend a midnight feast. It will be a really nice revival of an old tradition, and many will enjoy it. With this revival of old customs and traditions, the question that comes to my mind is: What benefit will this bring me? To what extent will these old traditions change and transform me? What will this new preparation for Christmas bring me that will make my everyday life different, richer, calmer and more meaningful? The beautiful old traditions are certainly necessary because they speak of our historical memory, which is necessary and we should not be ashamed of. Beautiful traditions are the wealth of a nation, and it is right to preserve and revive them. However, it seems to me that this will not bring into my daily life the new things that will challenge me, because they will offer me new content, because they will require me to bring into the Advent preparation for Christmas the novelties that are part of me, linked to my thinking and feeling. In this way, Christmas will no longer be just a nice old folklore, but will have a touch of the contemporary, of my personal life. Analysts have noted that man, especially Western man, and thus also Slovenian man, is increasingly losing his soul because he has allowed himself to be so drawn in by materialism that he can no longer shake it off. Materialism is like a terrible anaconda, a serpent that wraps itself around its victim and squeezes him so that he can no longer escape from its embrace. This squeezing of the serpent gets worse and worse by the moment, as it breaks the victim's bones, and in the end she suffocates, all numb. To live a more free life worthy of man, it is necessary to get out of this embrace and to put a limit to materialism. We must realise that money must not be our master, but on the contrary, we must be its master, we must put a limit to consumerism. Advent preparation for Christmas therefore consists first of all in making a careful analysis of my ordinary life. I must see clearly and evaluate my desires and expectations, but I must also be aware of my limits and my delusions. Both need to be put on the scales and to see which way the scales tip: if there are too many negative things, action needs to be taken immediately. Any delay will only lead to a growing alienation from oneself, from one's neighbours and from God. Any persistence in negative things leads to more and more dependence. At a certain point, you have to tell yourself that the time has come to get rid of all that weighs you down, takes away your freedom and harms you. It is necessary to remove all these things and say loud and clear to yourself: 'Why should I harm myself! I don't want to see this anymore! ""The strong will that is awakened by this then needs to be strengthened more every day. It is necessary to reckon with God, it is necessary to reckon with the power of prayer, and above all it is necessary to deepen faith. Only he who believes in God is then able to throw himself into God's arms, to confess his guilt and sins and to forgive first himself and then his neighbour. This is the only way we can purify ourselves and free ourselves from the past that presses us to the ground and does not let us breathe freely. We must first forgive ourselves, gain respect and trust, so that we can then forgive our neighbours and finally be reconciled to God. This is the only way to breathe more freely. Any search for any other means that does not take into account man's guilt and purify it with God's forgiveness and mercy is doomed to failure. So let us not fall for the various Internet offers that promise a quick solution. This is just a waste of money without any real effect. Why not rather cling to God, who demands no payment for Himself. His love is free, everything we receive from Him is free. Why not make the most of the opportunity that is given to us. Why not make something beautiful out of our lives that we will always be proud of and others will be richer for our change. Above all, we must remember what the prophet Jeremiah told us in the first verse: ""The days will come when I will keep my promise! ""For God keeps His covenant: what He promises, He keeps. Perhaps we do not see this in our own lives because we have not yet allowed God to come in and put our lives in order. Perhaps we have relied too much on ourselves and our own abilities, and so we do not recognise the miracles that are happening today. Perhaps we have been so tempted by money that we have bet everything on this one ticket, and so we are constantly afraid and trembling about what will happen to our savings, which have been severely depleted by the recession. Yes, we need to get rid of this fear and build our confidence on new foundations that are not destroyed by the moth. So today we set out on the road to prepare for Christmas this year. May this holiday truly be a challenge to everyone to make this Christmas different. Christ came as our Saviour to be reborn, so that we might become new people. So now is the chance for each of us to make that happen. There is no exception. For me, too, this feast is a challenge, even though things may be clearer to me in theory. Theory is not life. That is why the preparation and the celebration itself must leave an impact on our emotional sphere, on our attitude to life and to everything that surrounds us. When this happens, we will indeed look at Christmas very differently. It is certainly true that Christmas is the most romantic of all the Church festivals, but it must also bring new content to our lives. Let us therefore enter boldly into the Advent season and use it for our personal renewal and the renewal of our parish community. <p/> Contact us <p/> Spiritual reflection",Opinion/Argumentation,test

Rihtaštavlje is the 49th place in Slovenia where a water source has been restored with the financial assistance of Helios and the professional support of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning - After the blessing by the parish priest Janko Ivančič, the oldest villager, Terezie Mauko, was poured her first glass during the opening ceremony, with which she proudly toasted the gathered. <p/> In Rihtarovci, in the municipality of Radenci, the completely renovated village well was opened yesterday at noon with a short cultural programme by pupils from the Radenci Primary School and in the presence of many locals and guests. This spring, the municipality of Radenci applied for a call for funding, which for the tenth year has been organised by Helios and the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning as part of the campaign to preserve clean Slovenian waters. The village well in Rihtarovci convinced the expert selection committee and the renovation could soon start. <p/> The fountain is located in the central village area, in a small park next to a chapel with benches near the main road Radenci - Ljutomer. It is two kilometres from the centre of Radenci. It is a typical Styrian fountain, built more than a hundred years ago and equipped at that time with a large wooden wheel and a wooden shaft on which a supporting rope was wound with two wooden buckets rising up alternately. It is surrounded by a traditional wooden structure and the roof is made of brick tiles. It lies on a layer of clay up to 8 metres thick, which protects the groundwater from surface pollution and is 13 metres deep. The interior of the well was originally walled with sandstone, which was replaced by concrete channels 120 cm in diameter when it was rebuilt. Some parts have been modernised, but it remains essentially a copy of the decaying well. A submersible pump with a tap was added to facilitate the pumping of the water, and the original stone trough. The villagers used it until the construction of the village aqueduct The water in the well is in the self-purification phase and is not quite fit for drinking at the moment. <p/> The village well is also a popular walking route for guests of the nearby Radenci Spa, and will be of interest to thousands of annual hikers as part of the ""Three Hearts Marathon"". The fountain is also included in the conceptual design of the local water trail ""K stűdenci"", which was prepared by pupils of the Radenci Primary School and awarded a financial prize by the Helios Foundation. The pupils active in the project are working to make the trail a reality in the spring. It has also become a teaching point for the ECO Water System project, which is being developed by pupils from the local primary school. <p/> The restoration work on the well lasted from August to October and was carried out, also as a donation, by local companies and entrepreneurs and, of course, by the volunteer work of active villagers.

Cristiano Ronaldo put Real Madrid in front in the third minute after a brilliant solo effort, and Benzema then extended the advantage in the first half when he scored with a header. The second half started in the same way as the first, with Ronaldo, the current top scorer in La Liga, hitting the net again after just four minutes of play. As with Benzema's goal, Bale was the assistant for Ronaldo's second goal, adding two more assists to his tally against Sevilla. After Real's third goal, however, everything turned upside down for Real, as the hosts had two penalty corners in just two minutes, both of which were successfully converted by Viera. Real Madrid then regained control of the game and successfully brought the match to a close, with the players already starting to think about Tuesday's game against Juventus. <p/> Real Madrid visited the Vallecas stadium with fresh memories of the big win against Sevilla three days ago at the Bernabeu and the good second half performance at the Camp Nou the week before. The start of the match did not point to an exciting ending. Already in the third minute, when Cristiano Ronaldo launched a counter-attack, he passed it to Luka Modric, who gave the ball back to him with a beautiful pass, and then Cristiano Ronaldo first played brilliantly between the legs of the last defender Rayo, and in the final minute, face-to-face, he coolly matted the home goalkeeper Martinez with a shot into the bottom far corner to put Real in the lead. A super goal from the Portuguese, showing how in great shape he and Carlo Ancelotti's team are. Real doubled their advantage in the 31st minute when Karim Benzema headed home after a precise cross from the right by Gareth Bale. It was the Welshman's third assist in the last two games and the Frenchman's third goal in four days. The visitors gave the home side a real lesson in finishing, although the Whites could have gone further ahead after the first half after Real had two more good chances. Cristiano Ronaldo tried a volley in the 44th minute after a pass from Di Maria but his shot went wide of the post, while Carvajal's header was also just missed by inches by the Ruben goalkeeper. <p/> The second half, in which Illarra replaced Xabi Alonso, who is making his comeback from a long-term injury, continued in the same way as the first, with a Real Madrid goal. In the fourth minute of the second half, Bale was at it again, winning the ball on the right, breaking into the middle and passing to Ronaldo, who scored his second goal of the game to make it 3-0. It was Cristiano Ronaldo's 13th goal in La Liga this season, making him the top scorer in the Spanish championship. After a big lead for Carlo Ancelotti's charges, everything looked like a peaceful ending, but the hosts came completely close just two minutes apart. After clumsy interventions from Pepe and Marcelo, head referee Alfonso Alvarez Iquierdo twice pointed to the harshest penalty. Jonathan Viera was the better of the two in his duel with goalkeeper Diego Lopez. The home team gained confidence after scoring twice, and it was Diego Lopez who had to prove his worth in the 65th minute when he masterfully stopped a shot by Alberto Bueno. The hosts chased the equaliser until the end of the match, and on the other side Real had a couple of chances to score their fourth goal of the game, including two more attempts from Ronaldo that were saved by the Raya goalkeeper, but the score remained 2-3 and Real's ninth victory in the Spanish championship this season.",Opinionated News,test
126,"Slovenia: Public appeal by the Higher Education Trade Union of Slovenia <p/> Ljubljana, 16 June 2012 (MOREL) - The Higher Education Trade Union of Slovenia has addressed a public appeal to the government, the National Assembly, university rectors and faculty deans, and the National Agency for Quality in Higher Education, which we are publishing here in full: The results of the negotiations with the trade unions are very painful for public higher education. Because higher education is financed differently from secondary and primary education and because this financing has been carried out in an unconstitutional way for several years, universities have been left out of the negotiations. Not only has the state failed to adopt the law on the financing of state universities and colleges, which is required by the Constitution in its Article 58. It has crowned the unconstitutionality of the previous practice of funding by regulation by deciding the level of funding for higher education politically and arbitrarily, by rebalancing the budget. The State promises students free studies, while at the same time announcing tuition fees in the National Reform Programme. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly obvious that it is trying to artificially lower the quality of studies by putting financial pressure on public universities, thereby triggering the rampant privatisation of higher education. Universities have already had insufficient funds to carry out five years of study, and the new funding will be barely sufficient for the first level. In view of the financial constraints, the three public universities are already preparing to lay off fee-earners and temporary staff, to retire without replacements, and there are various ideas of radically reducing the rights deriving from titles, grades and employment contracts. These ideas culminate in unlawful proposals on unpaid additional teaching work, on supplementing full-time and additional teaching work with low-paid honorary work, and the demand that university teachers themselves provide universities with funds for the research part of their salary, which is already contractually due to them. This is roughly equivalent to requiring judges to generate part of their salary themselves on the market by securing a reasonable number of disputes in which to dispense justice. The non-recognition of research work and the expansion of self-financing part-time study could begin the uncontrolled disintegration of higher education as a public service. The work of higher education teachers and staff has always included both teaching and research. For a full-time or part-time employee, only the direct teaching commitment is defined; the remaining hours up to the full-time commitment comprise the indirect teaching commitment (preparation, examinations, tutoring, etc.), research (as demonstrated by meeting the habilitation criteria) and management work (membership of committees, etc.). The point of the legal regulation limiting the direct teaching obligation is that university teachers and staff are obliged to devote their regular working time to research, the results of which they must prove at the time of their election: every university teacher, with the exception of a minority of full professors, must be habilitated (elected to a title) every five years, and must meet demanding criteria for scientific work. Since habilitation resulting from research is a condition for maintaining employment, it is legally untenable for universities to make this same employment conditional on the independent acquisition of external research funding. The task of a university is not to reproduce existing knowledge, but to create and disseminate new knowledge. Therefore, basic research in universities must have stable sources of funding. The provision of these resources is to be laid down by law, in accordance with Article 58 of the Constitution. The Public Finance Balancing Act has allowed universities to modify their programmes autonomously. At first sight, it would appear that the State has thus given universities greater autonomy. In reality, however, it has given their managements all the power to rearrange, cut, merge and abolish study programmes at will. We would like to point out that such measures threaten not only employment, but also the quality of accredited programmes, the right of students to study in the programme in which they have enrolled and to pursue appropriate studies at a second level. We therefore call on the National Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Quality in Higher Education to problematise the reaccreditation of programmes if they are altered beyond recognition due to financial pressures or if they are implemented in a way that is not of the highest quality. Universities have insufficient human resources to carry out their studies, and at the same time the state, by withholding funds, is artificially creating a situation where there are suddenly too many staff. As this is a public service carried out in the interest of all the citizens of the Republic of Slovenia, we will initiate the appropriate legal procedures in relation to the undermining of the rights of public employees in universities. We would also like to point out that the rights of students are also at stake. If, under the financial conditions of the rebalancing, an agreement between the Ministry and the student organisation was possible, it is an agreement to destroy public higher education, the aim of which is rampant privatisation. The Ministry's promises that there will be no tuition fees are unconvincing hypocrisy, and the agreement with the official student organisation on free full-time study opens the door wide to the restriction of full-time study and the expansion of self-financing part-time study. The quality of studies will fall. Since the conditions for accreditation by the National Agency for Quality are low, opportunities will open up for private operators, who will be granted concessions by the state on the basis of easily obtained accreditation, according to the interests of individuals and political-economic clienteles. We propose that the National Agency for Quality tighten the conditions for institutional accreditation and demand an impact on the level of concessionary funding granted to HEIs. Above all, it is self-evident to require full funding for programmes already accredited, which are delivered as a public service and which have also been accredited on the basis of cost and staffing needs assessments. This includes professional, administrative and technical staff, who were already on low pay grades and have fallen even lower as a result of austerity measures. These categories of workers have hitherto enjoyed the basic rights that come with civil servant status, rights that may no longer be taken for granted in the forthcoming reorganisations. The State is deliberately depleting public higher education. In the words of the Minister, ""the government is forcing rectors to behave as any crisis manager would behave"". This statement is obscene and shows a complete lack of responsibility for a key area of development, as well as a lack of understanding of the social mission of universities and the constitutional role of higher education in the Republic of Slovenia. Recall that the autonomy of universities (Article 58 of the Constitution) is also to be interpreted by the Constitutional Court in the light of Article 59 of the Constitution, i.e. ""primarily as the autonomy of professors to research and teach autonomously (independently), without restrictions and pressures"" (U-I-34/94). Furthermore, as public servants, employees of higher education institutions perform a public service for the population of the Republic of Slovenia. Unfortunately, the government instead advocates a market-based approach, with an emphasis on corporate governance, consumerism and the pursuit of short-term profit. In this situation, we wonder whether universities will be able to fulfil their role? Will it be possible, in the face of financial cutbacks, to maintain the universal accessibility of education and the level of quality expected by students and employers? How is it possible that universities are playing an increasingly marginal role in the coming 'knowledge society'? The disintegration of higher education as a public service will not only affect the teaching and professional staff employed in universities. Profit-oriented higher education will inevitably widen the social divide between an elite minority who will be able to provide their children with a quality education, and thus with social status and security, and the vast majority of the rest of the population, who will either not be able to afford higher education or will be forced into long-term debt All this gives the unpleasant impression that university and college leaders have been too quick to bow their heads and accept political pressures. We know that crisis management is nothing more than the informal transformation of the university into a business that will serve neither the staff, nor the students, nor the economic and other development of the community, but the interests of local cliques. We therefore call on rectors and deans to firmly reject the destructive role assigned to them by politics and to open a broad public debate on the participation of workers and students in the governance of public universities. We remind university and faculty leaders that employees will not accept a situation in which external financial pressures become an excuse to promote political and private interests within the institutions themselves. We inform the government and the management of universities and faculties that, in a situation dictated by rebel budgets, we may be forced to suspend the study process already this calendar year. We call on students to support us in our efforts to achieve free and quality public higher education,"" said the appeal signed by Marko Marinčič. (end)",Opinion/Argumentation,test
130,"Air passenger rights <p/> People are increasingly travelling by air, but we are not aware of our rights as air passengers and how to react if, for example, a flight is delayed or cancelled. The very first right we have is that the airline must keep us informed about flight cancellations and the duration of the delay, the further course of events and, last but not least, about our rights. <p/> All the information listed below applies to flights within the European Union, to non-EU flights destined for the EU and to flights with a European air carrier. <p/> Delays <p/> If you are delayed for two hours or more for flights up to 1,500 kilometres, three hours or more for flights between 1,500 and 3,500 kilometres and four hours or more for flights over 3,500 kilometres, you are entitled to a telephone call, refreshments, food, accommodation and transport to your accommodation. When the flight is delayed for more than five hours, you can choose not to continue your journey, in which case the airline must reimburse the cost of your ticket and provide you with air transport to the place where you started your journey within seven days. <p/> Denied boarding <p/> If overbooking occurs and passengers with valid tickets are denied boarding, airlines must first try to find volunteers to give up their booking in exchange for certain benefits. Volunteers or stranded passengers should be offered a choice between full reimbursement of the ticket cost or a refund of between €125 and €600, payable within seven days, and re-routing on comparable terms. If they choose the latter, the carrier must also provide them with food, access to a telephone, accommodation and transport from the airport to their accommodation. <p/> Flight cancellation <p/> If the airline gives you at least 14 days' notice of the cancellation, offers you a re-routing with a similar take-off and landing time, or can prove that the cancellation is due to exceptional circumstances, then you are not entitled to compensation. Otherwise, you are entitled to reimbursement of between €125 and €600, depending on the length of the flight, or to alternative transport to your desired destination as soon as possible. <p/> If you do not continue your journey because of the cancellation, the airline must reimburse you within seven days for the cost of the ticket for the unused flights and for the flight that was already operated but no longer served its intended purpose according to the original travel plan. You must also be provided with a telephone call if necessary, refreshments, food, accommodation and transport to your accommodation, and you are entitled to compensation. <p/> What should I do if my flight is delayed, cancelled or denied boarding? <p/> If you experience any of the inconveniences listed above, you should immediately request and exercise the relevant information about your rights from the staff at the check-in counter or boarding gate, which the carrier is obliged to provide to you in writing. If you are unsuccessful in exercising your rights, you should complain in writing to the air carrier as soon as possible and, if you are still unsuccessful, you can complain to the competent national authority. <p/> Lost or damaged baggage <p/> In the case of damaged baggage, you must file a claim with the airline within seven days of receiving your baggage, or up to 21 days if your baggage is delivered late. If your luggage is lost, damaged or delayed, you may be entitled to compensation up to a maximum of €1,200. <p/> In the case of delayed baggage, you will be reimbursed for all essential purchases made while you were waiting for your baggage, so please keep all original receipts for the products as they must be presented to the airline. If your luggage is not found within 21 days, it is considered lost and you are entitled to compensation based on an inventory of lost items. <p/> What should I do if my luggage is lost? <p/> If your baggage has been lost, damaged or destroyed, or if there has been a delay in delivery, you should report it to the Lost Baggage Counter at the airport upon landing, where you will receive further instructions from the staff. If you are unable to check in at the counter (for example, because you do not speak the language), you must report the damage in writing to the carrier within 7 days, or 21 days if the baggage was delayed. <p/> Persons with disabilities <p/> Persons with disabilities and reduced mobility are protected by law from discrimination during booking and boarding. They are entitled to assistance at the airport and on board the aircraft.",Instruction,test
133,"JEDRO: The sum of two insurance benefits from two insurance contracts cannot be taken into account because each of the insurance contracts constitutes an independent factual and legal basis for the dispute. As none of the amounts claimed exceeds the audit threshold, no audit is admissible. <p/> CONCLUSION: The revision is dismissed. <p/> REFERENCE: The applicant claimed payment of insurance benefits under two insurance contracts. He claimed payment of SIT 700 000 under the supplementary accident insurance, taken out at the same time as the compulsory motor insurance, and SIT 955 603 under the collective accident insurance. Thus, by his primary claim, he claimed payment of SIT 1 655 603, and by his subordinate claim he claimed payment of SIT 700 000 under the first contract and EUR 5 356 under the second contract, in which the sum insured was denominated in DEM. The Court of First Instance ruled that the defendant must pay the plaintiff SIT 170 000, dismissed the primary claim in excess and further ruled on the costs of the proceedings. The Court of Second Instance allowed the applicant's appeal only in part by modifying the costs order, but otherwise dismissed it and upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance. <p/> The review was delivered to the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia and served on the defendant, who did not reply. <p/> The review is not allowed. <p/> According to Article 367(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 73/2007 ZPP - UPB3), a review is admissible in property disputes if the value of the contested part of the second instance judgment exceeds the amount of EUR 4,172.926 (formerly SIT 1,000,000). The applicant has indicated an amount of SIT 1,485,603 (now EUR 6,199.31) as the review value of the dispute, but such a definition is not correct for the purpose of determining the review value of the dispute. It is the sum of two amounts which he was unsuccessful in the litigation: the rejected amount of SIT 530 000 (now EUR 2 211,65) in respect of the first insurance contract which he himself had concluded and the total rejected amount of SIT 955 603 (now EUR 3 987,66) in respect of the collective accident insurance. The sum cannot be taken into account because each insurance contract is independent, concluded at different times and with different content, and therefore the contracts also constitute different factual and legal bases for the dispute. Since the condition laid down in Article 41(1) of the CCP in conjunction with Article 39 of the CCP for aggregating the amounts in dispute is not met, the value of each individual claim must be taken into account under the second paragraph of the same Article. <p/> None of the amounts mentioned exceeds the audit threshold. Therefore, pursuant to Article 377 of the CPC, the Court of Appeal decided on the applicant's unauthorised revision as set out in the operative part of the present decision, which also includes a decision on the applicant's claimed revision costs.",Legal/Regulation,test
134,"Do not leave children in the car! <p/> How many times have you been out on a trip alone with your child, and on the way you casually remembered that you had to go to the bank or the post office, and left your child waiting in the car because it was a really short errand? <p/> Although you may not have thought about it at the time, you should know that leaving children in the car can be extremely dangerous, not only in summer but also at all other times of the year. Do you want to know why? <p/> The sun heats the sheet metal <p/> Children are much more sensitive to heat than adults, which is especially dangerous in summer if you park your car in the sun. The inside of a car can heat up to 50 degrees Celsius or more in about 15 minutes, which can cause heat stroke in children. As well as the temperature itself, it is also important how the child is dressed and how old they are. The younger the child and the darker the colour of the car, the greater the risk. Conversely, the older the child is, the more easily he or she can withstand the heat, and the more likely you are to give him or her certain things, tell him or her to drink water and so on. And if you thought that a slightly open window was enough, you were wrong, because it doesn't make any difference. <p/> Villains at work <p/> It's not just the heat that can be dangerous for a child. Parents often leave the keys in the car when we have to run ""quick errands"", either because we leave the air conditioning on, the radio on, or because we're going to be ""back quickly"" anyway. In this case, although the child may not be hot in the car, the dangers are no less. However impossible and remote kidnapping may seem to us, the fact is that these crimes do not only take place abroad and on the cinema screen, but are, unfortunately, all too common in this country too. It also happens more than once that the villain is distracted by a car and, because he is in a hurry, he takes us both away. <p/> Young explorers <p/> Whether the car is exposed to the sun, whether we have left the keys in it or not, one thing is certain - children love to explore. Especially what they are forbidden to do in the presence of their parents. Of course, this depends on the age of the children - a baby is not interested in such things - but slightly older children are usually eager for the chance to satisfy their curiosity. Since we parents don't usually let them press buttons of all colours and shapes, play with levers, press pedals and turn steering wheels, they take advantage of our absence. They are too young to be aware of the dangers involved, so it is up to parents to take care of them. However short the task, you will probably agree that it is never, but never really, important enough to be worth the risk! <p/> Projects and actions",Opinion/Argumentation,test

165,"Resources <p/> Genealogy discovers and records personal information about individuals and, according to their relationship to each other, groups them together in family links in a specific time and place. In this study, the genealogist intervenes in history and relates family history to the general history, so he or she must at least be familiar with its landmarks and characteristics, such as: <p/> The language and scripts used in the archival material. <p/> Coats of arms and emblems used e.g. on seals, medals, coins. <p/> State and church arrangements. <p/> Customs and customs of society. <p/> Written and other sources of information (e.g. gravestones, votive stones, monuments). <p/> There is a very wide and varied range of genealogical resources and tools of all kinds on the web. You can find them by searching for general keywords such as: genealogy, genealogy, family tree, etc., or by narrowing your search to more specific search terms. Genealogical research generates a large amount of data which, without software support, is difficult to organise into meaningful wholes shortly after the genealogist has researched his or her immediate family. <p/> In Slovenia, Brother's Keeper is still the most popular genealogy software. It has the advantage over others of being translated into Slovene and of supporting the special characters of our alphabet. Among the more modern programmes, the more modern Family Tree Builder (FTB) My Heritage meets these requirements, and there may be others. The procedure for downloading a BK programme from the web is presented in two parts - downloading and adapting. The procedure is also described on the Slovenian Genealogy page, where there are many other useful links. <p/> A pointer to many genealogical resources has been provided by some of the more active genealogists on their websites. For example, colleagues Fonda and Zavodnik. The most complete worldwide genealogical signpost is certainly www.cyndislist.com. Among the domestic resources, we should mention SiStory, where some special issues of the journal Trees have been published, DLib, where, among others, the Lexicon of the Drava Banovina is published, and Kamra (Digitised Cultural Heritage of Slovenian Landscapes). <p/> For searching for persons abroad, there are worldwide genealogical data repositories such as Ancestry. A similar site is FamilySearch. Among European sites, the French Geneanet site and the German Association site are probably the most popular. However, to support the search for ancestors via the World Wide Web and the permanent storage of personal data specific to genealogy, web giants such as Google and Facebook are increasingly getting involved, storing a lot of personal data about their users, which will be the source of future genealogists. <p/> Genealogy is not a young science. The oldest genealogical works are the books of the Bible of the Old Testament. However, most of the old genealogies survive from the ancient world for the royal families and nobility.

191,"Television colloborations <p/> About a year and a half ago, Slovenia switched from analogue to digital TV reception. Quite a lot of people started to wonder what this would bring us and what it meant for our continued viewing of TV channels. The answer was very simple, because it was all due to the switchover to a newer technology, which, while it brings considerable improvements in terms of the picture and sound itself, before the switchover it was, in principle, more of a problem for the majority of the population. This difficulty meant either buying a converter or a new television that supports DVB-T. On this account, 2010 was quite a successful year for the sellers of this type of equipment, because monitoring programmes via an analogue signal was no longer possible afterwards, but I also think that both the Internet subs and the providers of other types of monitoring of TV channels were satisfied, because certainly not a few people opted for such a changeover. Eventually, the situation calmed down and it stopped being talked about, because things stood as they should. Well, yes, until it got complicated and a bit more serious. <p/> Earlier this year, Norkring ceased operating multiplex B (which they won the tender for), which contained TV3 and Pink Si, and the main purpose of the multiplex itself is to broadcast commercial programmes. Nevertheless, there were a number of other programmes that were licensed to be broadcast, but we did not see them during Norkring's management of multiplex B. Multiplex A, which is operated by Radio Television Slovenia, currently also broadcasts commercial programmes, even though it is intended only for national programmes. Thus, Slovenia has only one functioning multiplex, which contains both national and commercial programmes, and space for additional ones is running out. Since June, TV Slovenia's channels 1 and 2 have also been available in high definition (HD), but they can only be viewed by IPTV and cable TV users, and the switch to digital transmission has lost its significance, as HD viewing is not possible for viewers who watch the programmes via antennas. Instead, there are now four commercial channels in multiplex A, three of which - POP TV, Kanal A and Vaš kanal - have been there since the beginning, and were joined by Pink Si after the departure of Norkring. The multiplexes are now what they are, because the commercial channels will be in multiplex A until someone starts operating multiplex B again. This could be done again by Norkring or later after a public tender by someone else (source). <p/> On the other hand, there has been talk for some time of a new commercial programme, Planet TV, to be launched by Telekom, which would be quite different from the existing ones. Its content will consist of sports, films, serials and other programmes, and finally a news programme. It would be available via cable and IP television, and also via aerial reception (source). This is where the problem arises, because there are almost no more places in multiplex A, and the call for new channels was already published at the end of last October, with Golica TV, Sponka TV and TV Nakupi meeting the conditions. As the deadline (which is not legally binding) for issuing decisions is tomorrow, this could be delayed further, mainly due to pressure from Telekom, which did not apply for the tender within the October deadline (source). <p/> My view on all this is that, despite the pressure from Telekom, decisions should be issued to the programmes that applied for the tender in October and meet the conditions, and that once multiplex B has been given an administrator, the commercial programmes should go there and, if possible, TVS 1 and TVS 2 should start broadcasting in high definition in multiplex A.

215,"Today, the Minister of Culture, Majda Širca, opened the exhibition Drawing in Slovenia II 1940-2009 at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) in Zagreb, which presents the works of around 100 Slovenian artists. It is a selection of drawings from the exhibition of the same name, which was held last year at the City Gallery of Ljubljana. <p/> Drawing is one of the most daring, challenging and exciting genres within the field of art, because it confronts us with a very demanding and responsible gesture that we must not miss, a gesture that is unique and which, on the other hand, is often a matrix, a basis or a point of departure for other artistic practices, Širčeva said about the importance of drawings. These, she believes, have been lost, especially today, in the many postmodernist artistic genres. <p/> She stressed the importance of the exhibition for Slovenian art, as well as the outstanding cooperation with Croatia in the field of culture. The Croatian Minister of Culture, Bozo Biskupic, also pointed out at the opening that the Slovenian exhibition is a celebration of community and mutual understanding. He recalled that the three giants of Slovenian and European art - Zoran Mušić, Gabriel Stupica and Marij Pregelj - are a symbol of a common cultural centre, having studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb. <p/> It is the drawings of this trio that open the exhibition, said its curator and art historian Aleksandar Bassin, who said that drawing has never been a trendy exclusive. The exhibition, he said, is arranged according to the artists' ages, not their works. After the three artists mentioned, the works of selected artists follow, from sculptors and printmakers to painters of the middle generation. <p/> In the last part of the exhibition, there are young people who were born in the 1970s or 1980s, and it is they who, according to Bassin, most express the future of drawing, which is consciously and unencumbered living its full artistic life. <p/> Until 21 September, drawings created in various artistic techniques will be on display, providing both a representative insight into Slovenian artistic drawing of the last 70 years and the continuity of drawing as an independent chapter of Slovenian fine art. <p/> The Zagreb exhibition is also accompanied by a comprehensive monograph with interpretative critical commentaries on each artist.",News/Reporting,test
223,"I suspect that there are at least a handful of us who remember all too well the days when Ray Cokes used to roll the Slayers unreservedly in prime time and when, in the admittedly slightly later hours of the night, MTV Europe used to play a lot of what we still throw into the drawer of alternative and not overly commercial brass bands and brass bands were listened to, not just watched. I wouldn't really debate the diversity of tastes here, but there was a lot to be heard on that channel in its day, especially if you were persisting in a late-night ambush or suffering from insomnia. It would be difficult to judge the current state of mind of all the various derivatives of this brass band institution; I have not been following it for some time, but judging by the words of my younger colleagues, the spirit of the eighties and early nineties has got a bit stuck and has gone on holiday somewhere unknown. <p/> Why such a butch introduction, anyway? Simply because Arrested Development is one of those bands that, without MTV and its inventions like Unplugged, would almost certainly not be known here. This predominantly black collective came to our country in the first half of the nineties on the waves of the aforementioned TV channel with their debut album, etched themselves in our little brains for eternity and then somehow disappeared from our consciousness, so the announcement of CUK in Šiška came as quite a surprise to me. I have to admit, I was almost convinced that AD had disbanded a long time ago, so I was quite happy to see them in Šiška, almost as happy as the fact that last year they released a quite decent and listenable album Strong, which, although it doesn't bring any particular surplus, is a quite pleasant read and the hiphop-funky-Motown inspired melodies easily crawl under your skin, which has been AD's virtue from the very beginning. All in all, a show that would be a sin to miss. <p/> If talking about the fact that the performers wowed the assembled crowd is usually as predictable as possible, I can say exactly that about Arrested Development's performance in Šiška. I haven't seen so many happy and satisfied people per square metre in a long time. Although Šiška wasn't bursting at the seams, it was exactly so full that one could comfortably move around, raise one's hands and sing a little here and there, although it was obvious that the majority of the crowd hadn't come any further than their debut album and, understandably, they were mostly tripping on those good old shtick that had gotten under our skin, or on the musical interludes of the legendary Bob Marley or the slightly less legendary 4 Non Blondes. AD are obviously well aware that their reach in Europe, where they have come after many years, was quite limited and that their brass band alone is just a bit too little to get people up on their feet, but on the other hand, it is a commendable act that the collective did not descend to the level of musical aspirations, although it was just not possible without the most famous shtick, especially in the finale. The intensity of the concert itself was at a high level from the very beginning and it got a bit higher towards the end, also thanks to the drum, bass and karaoke interludes, which, although they cheapened the overall impression a bit for my taste, then in a long encore, perhaps better said in the second part of the concert, they brought the show perfectly to the grand finale, when the brakes were released and the chemistry between the band and the audience worked so well that we can already speak of perfection. <p/> As they like to point out, AD play brass music for the people, by the people, and it would be really hard to find a better demonstration of this principle, especially if we're talking about big concerts, or concerts where at least a hundred or so heads are packed in and there's no question of an intimate atmosphere. There is no doubt that the ADs are well tuned and well tied and know exactly what and how to do to ensure that entertainment, mixed with a good-natured knock on the all-embracing human consciousness, achieves its aim and purpose. Truth be told, AD haven't come up with anything too revolutionary in the last fifteen years, but they make up for it perfectly with the sincerity they put into their music and, apparently, their performances, so it seems they are still that fresh band that exploded in our ears in the early nineties. There wasn't as much of a throwback in their performance as you might expect, more a kind of timelessness caught up in the here and now and a fascination with it, just as the band themselves seemed fascinated by the response they were getting. Look at the photographs and it might be clearer to you what I am trying to say. <p/> In short, the AD concert was simply an uninhibited, relaxed experience of an unpretentious brass band trying to please a wide audience, but not quite everybody and not exactly at any price, which is of course good for the audience, but a little less grateful for the performers themselves, who somehow remain in the shadow of the brass band, which in one way or another, not even necessarily a bad one, stands out and the whole. It's certainly fine and dandy to hear something new and unusual, but even simple entertainment, which nevertheless has a message and is not entirely shallow, is not superfluous and comes in handy now and then. AD are masters at this and it was a real pleasure to listen to them here for the first time, and I hope not for the last time.",Review,test

236,"Annual General Meeting, 19 March 2013 <p/> Traditionally, and in accordance with the law and the provisions of the Statutes of our Association, the General Meeting, as the highest body, adopted the report on the activities, the financial report and the report of the Supervisory Committee for the year 2012. This was the first year of the new term of office of the bodies of the Association and the 22nd year since the founding of the Association. <p/> Of course, we remained true to our mission. Raising awareness among the membership and the general population about the importance of cardiovascular disease prevention has been, is and will continue to be a constant feature of our work. <p/> The reports were adopted unanimously by the branch representatives present. <p/> In short, we can report that we have achieved most of the tasks we set ourselves in our work programme. <p/> We would like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the innovations that have marked the Slovenian prevention scene, in particular the measurement of the ankle-brachial index, the atrial fibrillation prevention programme, for which we have been awarded a global prize since the end of 2011, and the establishment of the 25 × 25 network of NGOs in the field of public health. All three of these innovations have been widely covered by the Slovenian media. We carried out all the well-known preventive measurements and added venous plethysmography, helped several thousand people with various advice, and organised many interesting lectures and workshops. <p/> The magazine For the Heart has been our hallmark for the past year. We are proud of all 7 issues and also at the AGM we thanked the editorial board headed by Prof. Dr. Ales Blinec, MD. <p/> We organised many hikes, excursions and other forms of recreation. If we were to add up all the kilometres walked by our hikers and walkers, we would come up with a big number. <p/> The World Heart Day events started with a march in Novo mesto and continued with events in various places around Slovenia, with the main event taking place at the BTC in Ljubljana. <p/> It is also worth remembering Melodies for the Heart. The Slovenian Octet in the Ljubljana Opera House really proved how a beautiful song has a soothing effect on the heart. <p/> Our branches and the Society as a whole are organising many activities. It is simply not possible to present everything in a short article. <p/> The sources of funds have also changed quite a lot. The share of income from our own activities and the share of funds obtained through calls for tenders have increased, while the share of funds from advertising has decreased. <p/> All in all, 2012 was a successful year for our association, although we made a loss of EUR 2 200, which we will cover from the association's fund. At the same time, the General Assembly clearly recognised that we need to look for new and ever new programmes. Only in this way will the Society be able to successfully fulfil its mission in the future. <p/> At the end of the Assembly, the President of the Heart Association, Matija Cevc, MD, and the Vice-President, Boris Cibic, MD, presented the 2012 awards of the Society.

The project is the result of many years of cooperation between the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia, Posta Slovenije, Telekom Slovenije and the Technical Museum of Slovenia. <p/> The Museum of Post and Telecommunications houses the renovated and expanded collections History of Post, History of Telecommunications, Women Telephone and Telegraph Operators and the Zhiva's Corner, which is intended for the youngest visitors. On this occasion, we also opened the temporary exhibition The beginnings of mobile telephony in Slovenia. <p/> The Postal History collection shows the development of the post office from prehistoric times to the present day. In four rooms, there are models of postal carriages, reconstructions of post offices and postmen's uniforms from different periods, as well as various means of postal transport (carriage, moped, bicycle). In addition to the above, you can watch excerpts from films on the theme of the post office and an animated film entitled Whose Letter Is It? The relocation of the museum has a special significance for the inhabitants of Polhov Gradec, as the post horn is returning to their town. It was once the property of the Tomšič family from Polhov Gradec, who had a lease on the post office in Polhov Gradec since 1869. <p/> The History of Telecommunications collection pays special attention to women telegraphists and telephonists. The development of telephony and telegraphy helped to create new jobs, which were filled mainly by women. Old telephone sets, teleprinters, telephoto machines and other devices for sending messages over distance are also on display. You can listen to how telephones were used in the past. Since December 2008, visitors can also see and try out the telephone and teleprinter exchange. <p/> The Animal Corner is aimed at the youngest visitors to the museum, who learn about the history of post and telecommunications in the children's corner through games (Find a Pair, Post through Time) and various workshops (making a post horn, a post cap, stamps, etc.).",Information/Explanation,test

At the Chaos Communication Congress in December, researchers Ang Cui and Salvatore Solfo from Columbia University (USA) showed how a small device can be connected to the phone's serial port and loaded with malicious code that allows an attacker to take complete control. This allows the attacker to remotely monitor phone calls and turn on the microphone to eavesdrop on conversations in the room. <p/> Everyone does something stupid at some point.

269,"Proposal for a Spatial Development Strategy (SPR) for the Municipality of Radovljica <p/> J.U.: On the margins of the public debate held on Wednesday, 10 January 2007 from 6 to 8 p.m. <p/> All municipalities in Slovenia are in the middle of a planning process. By July 2007, they should have brought their respective spatial planning acts, which are extremely complex in terms of procedure, into line with the new legislation. Since only a few municipalities are further along than ours (we are in the middle of the beginning), is it to be expected that either the deadline will be extended, or the government will just manage to do as much as it can, and finally, for once, reward those who can do it by the deadline, and the rest ...? <p/> Undoubtedly, these processes are and will be the first serious planning in more than 20 years, in other words: it is an extremely challenging undertaking for the administration, the general and interested public and the planning profession. Since 1980 (self-management), we have been ""tinkering"" with the spatial and environmental planning system on the basis of the non-market economy, which - surprisingly - has been quite good in some parts. <p/> As far as our municipality is concerned: need it be pointed out that the administration's management has approached the matter left-handed in terms of substance and procedure? It simply does not have the expertise in cases of major dilemmas! <p/> Yes, that's the way it is when bureaucrats ignore the rajas! All the indications are that this planning will receive the same treatment as the dog excrement ordinance, which is of course not news in Radovljica. Last night, the Director, in a low-key rhetoric, respectfully stressed the importance of the process and the document, but only actions count. <p/> Let us stress: <p/> everything in the municipality revolves around space. Other departments are also important, but not as fatal as encroachments. The only complete department of the municipal administration, staffed by professional, educated and administratively proficient employees, looks as if they have been successfully weaned off professionalism and accustomed to subservience to politicians, like the MOL, ""when everyone is busting their ass"". This is due to a misguided governmental logic (we are in charge now, if something is not right, we will show that this is the only possible and even the only right thing to do, that is why we have PR) and a touch of servility, only the first silence and eaten professionalism will suffice... <p/> The materials under discussion do not testify to the care of a good steward for the emerging creature, in fact, it could even be argued that something (the ALCs) was explicitly not allowed to be included in it. <p/> Even the operational meetings of the administration with the spatial planning authorities (e.g. KS, sectoral, e.g. agriculture, housing, etc.) could have yielded more if they had been properly conceived and committed to. To be clear: the administration is the planning authority, and the documents are drawn up together with a specially paid team. And if something is left out or selectively drafted, we - with their superficial ""reading"" of our space - are the ones in trouble. If such a document is commissioned and its content dictated by politics, then we are far from a profession (Al Gore, An Inconvenient Truth ... ), nothing changes (except for the worse). <p/> What is also missing are proposals from those responsible officials (aren't we making too many synecdoches? ! ) who, in their official capacity, are the first to be responsible for making proposals (obligations of laws, decrees, contracts: local infrastructure, culture, education, etc.). <p/> The situation does not show the slightest concern for the mayor (excused absence abroad, where are the two vice-mayors? ) or for the director of the administration, who should have a project manager, and above all, be trusted to do so. The process thus has no profiled promoter ('municipality', mayor, director, head of department, chairman of the spatial planning committee? ! ) and does not even receive the necessary publicity. If you sell, advertise! There is no campaign, logo or sign that something fatal is in the pipeline to involve as many people as possible in the processes, and consequently a greater involvement of the disciplines. The time around the New Year is, of course, not the right time for unveilings. The administration is merely covering legal formalities, not the substantive reasons for extending the festive blackout. <p/> What stands out from such superficial processes is the ""redundancy"" of planning in the light of the parallel ad hoc actions promoted (elections), and the ""pro forma"" content of the ""development coalition"", the voting machine of the only good thinker who will lead us to paradise anyway, is a little annoying in the new mandate. <p/> Not to mention the occasional carping about the adopted and approved development platforms 2007 - 2013 (we are going to the region for EU money ... ), which are not yet recognised as typical political documents for daily use. <p/> We can be quite calmly critical, because the product under discussion (the decree) speaks of the politicisation of purely professional tasks. The formal inclusion of the CFs (do we have them for that?) and the exclusion of the 11 ""development opposition"" councillors of the municipal council is living proof of paper democracy, or of the scenario of how ""Janko"" (who is the ""broomstick"" here? ) imagines a wonderland where we will all be living like in paradise.... <p/> Everything points to the fact that the understanding of the preparation of the emerging document is reduced to an administrative minimum, everything that exists today without propaganda, if it really is not indispensable, practically does not exist. <p/> (J.U.: more information on the contents will be presented periodically, the public debate is open until 15 January 2007, more information on the decree and the background is on the CoR website). <p/> The public debate, the proceedings and the controversial contents are reported by the main municipal media (website) amongst ""other things"" with only a cursory information on the hearing, the documents are attached. That this is not enough is shown by all the poorly attended hearings, but nothing by the administration! <p/> We will wait with interest to see what the Provincial News has to say about the procedures and processes. It is not worth pointing out that the administration has not taken care - apart from the filming, to which we have been warned a couple of times by the Director of the administration - of the ""public relations"" which otherwise covers the Mayor's every step (ec). Or is it? <p/> HERE'S an excerpt from last night's debate, to prove how recently ago some people took the now fatal spatial interventions lightly and politicised them, and how ""everything"" is politics (only how will they justify them tomorrow? ): <p/> ""... Radovljica's landscape will be by far the most damaged by the semi-tubed AC of all the interventions. The unnatural embankments on both sides take away from the plain what is most valuable and distinctive, or add something alien to it ..."" / Statement by a representative of the KR Institute for the Protection of Natural and Cultural Heritage, ... who also informed us that we have insufficiently illuminated pedestrian crossings ...?/. <p/> (J.U.: Madam, just where was she during the mayor's ""semi-digging"" into the AC problems? <p/> Another, this time verbal, proof: <p/> Semi-deepening is of course not ""deepening"" and more than obviously nothing good, useful can be born out of ""semi-(itic) deepening"". <p/> We have evidence, look out of the car window when you drive down the main road ...).",Opinion/Argumentation,test
275,"The Heart Trail in Carinthia <p/> The Heart Trail is approximately 5 kilometres long and has an altitude difference of 180 metres. It is marked with a coloured signpost and almost 20 information boards. It takes about an hour and a half to walk along the trail, and even longer if you actively explore the sights indicated on the signs. <p/> The idea of the Heart Trail was born when looking for ways to offer people a health break. The study circle of Jožica Heber from Dravograd, which is part of the Slovenian Heart and Vascular Society, came up with the idea of a trail, designed and marked it, and offered it as an option for recreational hikes. The technical and organisational work was carried out by Ludvik Pušnik from Dravograd, and the idea was supported by the Dravograd Tourist Board. The trail follows a number of paths and abandoned tracks. In order to add research content to the trail, 20 information points have been erected, where most of the information about Dravograd's natural heritage can be found.Dr Branko Vreš, Rector of the Faculty of Biotechnics in Ljubljana, took care of this, while cultural and historical facts were written down by Marjan Kos, curator of the Koroška Regional Museum in Slovenj Gradec. <p/> The route is not difficult, it is suitable for everyone. It starts at the Health Centre in Dravograd, turns north on the steps and joins the local road Dravograd-Ojstrica at the direction sign at Poberžnik's house. It continues towards the Old Castle. The first stop is at the foresters' house, the Forsthaus, where foresters used to live and work. The house has been preserved in its original form and so has the tower, which catches our eye and had a special purpose. There used to be a nursery nearby, where you can read all about the cultivation of spruce, pine and larch seedlings. The trail then leads to the GradKuplen forest road. At the top, you will have a wonderful view of the town of Dravograd, its surroundings and the vast green forests. The castle shows its former grandeur with a remnant of the wall still standing. The castle was built in the first half of the 12th century, when Bernard of Spanheim became the owner of the Drava Valley. Over the centuries, the castle has changed hands, even being owned by the Counts of Celje and the Habsburgs, among others. North of the castle, a path leads to the ruins of the round court tower, where many a serf's life was extinguished. On the path below the Castle Bytown, a signpost soon directs you to the local Viltužnik-Mori road as you enter the forest. From there, you can see Libeliška gora and Strojna, as well as all three Dravograj bridges, the railway bridge and two road bridges. The view of the Dravograd Lake, created after the construction of the hydroelectric power station, is also extraordinary. The dammed area has developed into a marsh with reedbeds, which provides a rich habitat for many rare plants and animals, including some endangered ones. The lesser spotted bat and the rough bat live here, while the muskrat is common among the larger animals in the lake area. More than 150 species of birds are known to breed here, either permanently or occasionally, and swans are also regular visitors to the lake. <p/> The trail then leads on to the Dravograd-Vič national road, past the Dravograd hotel and petrol station, and winds along the path past the Sports Centre and the cemetery to the Fishermen's Home, where it approaches the River Drava. At Planšak, by the pier, there is a sign explaining the loading of sawn timber, the shayk, the ford and the harbour, and a little further on there is information about the history of the bridge and the bridge tolls. The ford used to cross the Drava only in Dravograd and Trbonyi. The St. Pauli serfs were exempted from the payment of the broadside, bridge and mitre fees, while the others had to give three sausages, cheese and ten eggs in addition to the broadside to be transported in the grain. However, since the ford was in the possession of the land lord of Dravograj, the fordsmen also had to pay her. The information board also tells you all about the smuggling of salt and more. From this westernmost point, the route follows a section of the trim track past a railway bridge that survived the bombing during the Second World War. The power station on the Fisherman's Path is not far from the bridge. It was built to meet the occupier's great demand for electricity and was one of the most modern in Europe at the time. The path then continues up the slope below the post office to the municipality and ends at the Dravograd Health Centre. <p/> Franc Heber, a general practitioner in Dravograd, recommends walking in his clinic, especially for orthopaedic and heart patients, and it has two main benefits: exercise and spiritual calming. Dr Heber told us about the path: ""The path is not too steep and not too long, it takes an hour and a half to walk it. This is the right time for the heart to reach the right frequency, 110 beats per minute. Walking is a great aerobic exercise, as oxygen is the best food for all parts of the body, from the supply of the brain to the heart. ""A walk along the Heart Path offers the freshness of nature and plenty of sunshine, and promises peace and tranquillity and an extraordinary view of Dravograd and its surroundings.

276,"Memories <p/> Memories <p/> After the war we lived on food, textile and other necessities. But just because you had a card didn't mean that you could get the goods you needed. Our mothers were queuing outside the shops long before they opened. Hardly expected and essential goods for families were not always in perfect condition. The flour was often (as we used to say) ""alive"". <p/> This meant that moths had invaded it. We did not throw away such flour either. My mother would fry the flour in a large pan on a hot fire to kill the animals, then sieve it on a thick sieve and that was how we used it later. <p/> I also remember what underwear was like in those years. There was no elastic in the underpants, just a plain ribbon, and we had to tie our underpants with it. When the underwear got proud and tore, it would be patched up. It was also often the case that double underpants became single underpants. Men's shirts were also mended. The bottom part was cut off and the collar and cuffs were redone. <p/> Socks that could no longer be mended were also cut above the ankle and a part of the other socks was added. So, once again, a new pair was made from the double worn-out socks. <p/> The dresses were not ready-made, but were made for us by seamstresses who may or may not have been trained in this profession. The dresses were sewn for the children in such a way that the length could be extended by at least 10 cm. We children grew quickly and a dress sewn in this way could grow with us for some time. When we outgrew the length of the dress, a new piece of fabric was inserted into the sleeves, usually in a different material and pattern to the original dress. <p/> Coats were made in the same way. When we outgrew them, despite the lengthening, they would fray and the cloth would turn the other way and be sewn into a new coat for the next child... <p/> Without spots and without cards, we could buy tennis shoes on Partizanska Street near Borovo. These were summer shoes that were made of rubber underneath and canvas on top. They were usually grey in colour. We children brightened them up by painting them with white chalk. I don't know how we got the paint to stay on, we must have got the chalk wet. <p/> In the summer we also wore special summer slippers, which were made of cornhusks. We could get them for free (no tickets). The slippers were so sharp that we often had bloody toes. <p/> In the summer we also wore ""spaghetti shoes"", which were made by a shoemaker. They were made of felt (strong felt), grey in colour. The felt was connected to the sole by a shoelace. The children also wore such shoes for special occasions - for example, for confirmation. <p/> The shoemakers put metal rings on the toes and heels so that we could wear the shoes.",Information/Explanation,test

But it doesn't have to be, sometimes only a close analysis of a photo or a sharp eye can reveal their flaws - some of them hide them quite well, but there are many who obviously don't care. Feet certainly tell a lot about people's habits and personal hygiene, something that the following famous faces are probably not aware of: <p/> It's true that Naomi Campbell is one of the most successful models of all time, but that title has taken its toll - her feet look deformed. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Iman is absolutely beautiful, but the sandals are too small for any feet. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Even though Holly Madison is a former Playboy bunny and ex-girlfriend of Hugh Hefner, she could do a lot better with her feet. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Some people just don't have nature's way with every part of their body, so Jennifer Garner's slightly odd toes are not her fault. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Christina Hendricks didn't follow the rules this time - no matter how much you like your shoes, you shouldn't choose them if your foot is too big, or in this case, especially too wide for them. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Sarah Jessica Parker's effortless prancing around the streets of New York in heels as Carrie Bradshaw clearly had its drawbacks. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> As with Naomi, Kate Moss' feet have walked countless catwalks. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Kim Kardashian refused to give up her high heels even when she was heavily pregnant, and the result was a defeat. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Britney Spears clearly hurt herself in this case, but she could have done with at least a hint of special, opaque make-up.",Opinion/Argumentation,test
279,"Others about the event <p/> 7th Children's Bazaar Ljubljana: 2012 <p/> This is the second year in a row that Afrodita Cosmetics has participated in the Children's Bazaar. We recognised a great opportunity in the project to present our new BABY & KIDS NATURAL cosmetics to both existing and potential new customers. Considering the number of contacts established and the positive reactions from visitors, we believe that our participation in the Children's Bazaar has been extremely successful both years. We have fulfilled our main objective - to get closer to our target group of customers: mainly parents, but also toddlers. For the latter reason, we plan to participate in the Children's Bazaar again next year. <p/> Nastija Egartner Marketing Communication Kozmetika Afrodita d. o. o. <p/> The Children's Bazaar in Maribor and Ljubljana presented many opportunities for families to spend quality time together. That is why Sava Hotels & Resorts was not missing among the suppliers. While children were eagerly participating in children's workshops at our stand, their parents and older companions were interested in active holidays in our destinations. We are delighted to have recorded a large number of bookings for family holidays as a result of our presentation at the Otorka Bazaar, and we recommend this type of cooperation to other organisations and companies. <p/> Slavica Rešeta Market Administrator - Slovenia Sava Hotels & Resorts <p/> At the 7th Children's Bazaar Ljubljana, we had a very pleasant experience with the organiser of the fair, Proevent d.o.o., with our fair performance, where we presented the project ""I like to eat fish"". The staff of this company is characterised by their exceptional professionalism, professional and responsible attitude and their great sense of care for exhibitors and visitors. We look forward to working with them in the future. <p/> This is the first year we have participated in the Children's Bazaar in Ljubljana. Our company is still young, but we aim to be the best provider of developmental or didactic toys for children of all ages. The Children's Bazaar is the best way for us to get in touch with our customers and direct users of our toys. We were very satisfied with the attendance and the atmosphere on the fairground and we will definitely see you in 2013. <p/> Peter Goričan Singa d.o.o. <p/> 7th Children's Bazaar Ljubljana in the media <p/> As we are a very young company, this year was our first time participating in the Children's Bazaar. We were delighted with the atmosphere at the event, as there was really no shortage of positive energy. We achieved our business goals: we presented our organic cotton products for babies and toddlers to young parents and pregnant women. We had a unique response to our stand and got confirmation that we are heading in the right direction. This customer contact is very important for our online shop, so we will definitely be back next year. <p/> Alenka Bombažek d.o.o. <p/> Before the Children's Bazaar event there was a lot of apprehension about how critical visitors would react to our promotion of craft professions. Up to now, we have mainly targeted primary school pupils in the last third of the school year when promoting craft professions, but we were pleasantly surprised by the decision to focus on younger pupils this time. The response from the children, and especially from their parents, has been overwhelming. The Slovenian Chamber of Commerce and Industry would also like to highlight the exemplary cooperation with the organiser Proevent d.o.o. and would like to take this opportunity to thank them very much. <p/> Mitja Korunovski Education Centre of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry <p/> We participated in the Children's Bazaar for the second year in a row. Last year, when we participated for the first time, we were surprised and delighted by the visit, but at the same time, we were not adequately prepared to communicate with the visitors. This year we prepared better and offered visitors an animation - Frisbee golf, which is one of the activities in our Summer Park on Krvavec, new this season. Attendance at this year's fair was once again very good and certainly above average compared to other fairs we attend. We are also pleased with the response of visitors to the fair, as a number of them have already visited our park and redeemed benefits/prizes from our animation game from the fair. A big thank you to the organisers for listening and coordinating. <p/> Luka Vrančič RTC Krvavec, d.d.<p/> Today, we visited the Children's Bazaar at the Economic Exhibition Centre with the children from the Najdihojca kindergarten in Ljubljana (Butterflies and Magpies groups). We had a free guided tour of the fair. The tour guide was very nice and we must praise her for making a great effort. The Bazaar itself is interesting and offers a variety of activities for both young and old. Thank you on behalf of the children and staff of the Najdihojca Kindergarten, Thumbelina Unit - Butterflies and Magpies Group. We will come again. <p/> Najdihojca Kindergarten, Thumbelina Unit <p/> The future is in the hands of our children, let's make sure it is full of life, peace, happiness, beauty, joy of work and learning... We brought a piece of this idea to life at this year's Children's Bazaar. With our Montessori room and the Montessori materials and other developmentally-didactic toys presented, we wanted to add a touch of the importance of education. Visitors approached with great interest, with many questions, eager for information. The Montessori room was full of our little ones throughout the fair and surrounded by many observers, to whom we gave away great prizes. We are definitely still in touch with our visitors. <p/> Katarina Zver Belovič World of Children <p/> The large turnout at this year's Children's Bazaar event for families is a real confirmation that the organisers know how to listen to both children and parents. The pleasant and unobtrusive sales approach of the exhibitors, the educational activities and the charity campaigns provide a pleasant atmosphere for visitors and for us - the companies presenting our products or services. <p/> Tanja Pirc Podobnik Mercator d.d. <p/> Ljubljanske mlekarne has already presented itself at the Children's Bazaar several times. We have been developing the idea for the presentation ourselves over the years, but GR Engineering's support has always been welcome in its realisation. The team, which is competent in various areas (technical, communication, organisational, etc.), has always been there to help us achieve our goals. The Children's Bazaar is well organised and we will definitely be back again this year. <p/> Sara Wagner Ljubljanske mlekarne d.d. <p/> At the Children's Bazaar, which took place at the Gospodarské razstaviště Exhibition Centre, children from the Oton Župančič Kindergarten were given the opportunity to visit various exhibitions, and at the same time, they participated with their own items and also performed on stage. The professionals decided to take the children to the Children's Bazaar in the future, which offered a variety of activities for children. <p/> Ksenija Grabovica Assistant Director of the Otona Župančič Kindergarten <p/> The Children's Bazaar made a very positive impression on us, especially the freshness of the young families and their interest in experiencing nature and our ethnological workshops. <p/> Nives Brezovnik Rogatec Institute for Culture, Tourism and Development <p/> In 2010 we participated in the Children's Bazaar for the first time. The organisation of the event (exhibition spaces and assistance with their equipment, communication with the organisers, etc.) is at a very high level.

319,"Three Men in a Boat, not to mention the dog, is definitely one of the most entertaining books I've ever read. Jerome Flap Jerome hooks the reader right from the start. After all, a story about three hypochondriacs cannot be boring. And so what when someone has every known disease in this world, except the knee of a snapper. Jerome concluded something like this: ' At first I was quite hurt by it, it seemed like a kind of insult. Why don't I have a knee? Why this unjust neglect? But after a while, less British feelings prevailed. I said to myself: I have all the other diseases known to pharmacology and, becoming less selfish, I decided that I would get along without a knee. Gout had apparently attacked me in the worst possible form, and without realising it gallstones had apparently plagued me from a young age. After the gallstones, there was no more illness, so I decided that there was nothing else wrong with me.'<p/> So the three friends set off on a 'boating' trip down the Thames, peppered with all the adventures that can befall a traveller. And many astute observations - such as why women shouldn't pull boats, or what happens to ladies who go on picnics in their best dresses.

All in all, it is a pity, because Confucius is part of history. <p/> I would hardly call Confusion a serious convention.

341,"Friday 29 December 2006 <p/> In December 2006, on the margins of the European Social Platform meeting at the Grand Hotel Union in Ljubljana, representatives of the Family Initiative met with Mr William Lay, Executive Director of COFACE - Confédération des Organisations Familiales de l'Union Européenne, or in Slovene the Confederation of Family Organisations of the European Union. We presented to Mr Lay the state of family policy in Slovenia and the efforts of the Family Initiative to develop family-friendly legislation in Slovenia. We presented the current proposals and initiatives for legislative change in Slovenia that we have prepared in the Family Initiative. We presented proposals to increase the competitiveness of parents in the labour market, proposals to improve the conditions for families with several children in the area of childcare, proposals to amend pension legislation and proposals for a fairer distribution of the costs of childcare between parents and individuals without children. The overall conclusion of the participants was that the Family Initiative is working on proposals that are also relevant for other members of the European Alliance. On the other hand, we can better draw on experience from abroad to identify family policy measures that have already shown results there. Family policy is implemented in each Member State separately and in a disconnected manner, and the European Union does not have a common family policy. For this reason, NGOs working to improve family policy in individual countries have joined together to form a common organisation, COFACE. So far, there has been no Slovenian representative in this organisation. That is why Mr Lay invited the Family Initiative to take an active part in this association. Those present agreed that membership in this organisation would be beneficial for both the Family Initiative and family policy in Slovenia. We believe that the benefits of membership would also justify the additional costs associated with membership. We parted with the hope of meeting next time as full members of COFACE, and thus to work together on family policy in the European Union. <p/> Thursday 12 October 2006 <p/> The coalition groups listened to the warnings of the Family Initiative that the proposed Income Tax Law, in the article providing for tax relief for dependent children, should be amended so as not to worsen the relative position of parents compared to taxpayers without children. Based on our warnings, the NSi, SDS and SLS groups of MEPs have drafted amendments to correct the draft law. In the course of the coordination with the Ministry of Finance, it was finally decided to amend the Bill by increasing the progressivity step of the tax relief from the third child onwards from EUR 748 to EUR 1500. While this solution does not meet the full requirements of the Family Initiative, it does address the main anomaly and shortcoming of the proposed law. For a number of families, the proposal will also not only maintain, but even slightly improve their relative position compared to taxpayers with the same income without children. <p/> Compared to the original proposal of the Family Initiative, the State will now make some savings and we expect that this will make it easier to implement other, perhaps even more important, family policy measures, such as incentives for parents to take up employment after the return of parental leave and part-time work. <p/> At this point, I would like to commend the cooperation of the expert colleagues of the NSi and SDS Groups of Members of the European Parliament and of some of their MEPs, who, during the negotiations with the Ministry of Finance, also checked the proposals and solutions they discussed with us, thus enabling us to participate constructively in this process with our own calculations and assessments. <p/> Tuesday, 30 May 2006 <p/> On World Family Day in May, we held a well-attended round table discussion at the General Assembly entitled The fertility problem between parents and the state, which was attended by the Minister of Finance, Dr Andrej Bajuk, the State Secretary at the Ministry of Education and Science, Dr Magdalena Šverc, the Director of the Directorate for the Family at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Development, Ms Majda Erzar, and the Acting Head of the Housing Sector at the Ministry of the Interior, Ms Anita Hočevar Frantar. The round table and its content were reported in most media. <p/> Thursday, 01 December 2005 <p/> The Family Initiative wrote to Prime Minister Janez Janša on 4 November 2005 asking for a discussion on measures to increase the birth rate and improve the situation of families, and the context of the proposed reforms from the perspective of parents and families. <p/> On 25.11.2005 we received a rather vague reply from the Prime Minister's Office.",Opinionated News,test
349,"NSI and SDS: Mojca Kucler Dolinar wants to give Ljubljana new substance <p/> Tuesday, 28.2.2012 <p/> At today's press conference, Mojca Kucler Dolinar presented her candidacy for mayor of Ljubljana. She began by stressing that Ljubljana needs new leadership, freshness, economy and responsibility. At the press conference, her candidacy was endorsed by representatives of New Slovenia and the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS): Anton Kranjc, representative of the NSi City Committee, Dragutin Mate, President of the SDS City Committee, Dr Žiga Turk, Minister of Education, Culture and Sport, Aleš Hojs, Minister of Defence, and the Director of the Government Communications Office, Mag. Anže Logar. <p/> As she said in her opening remarks, from the very beginning of the identification process, she has been working to bring the Spring Spring Day parties together to agree on a joint candidacy. Both the initiative and the support then came from the ranks of the Slovenian Democratic Party. The candidacy is first and foremost the result of her personal decision. The candidacy is a particular challenge for her - she is familiar with the mayoralty, having followed it closely as a city councillor, and as such is well acquainted with Ljubljana's burning issues. After all, she is also a resident of old Ljubljana, which has become a beautiful city centre in recent years, but looks are not everything. Behind it are many problems that citizens face on a daily basis. . <p/> There are still a number of deliberately inflicted injuries to the Ljubljana organism that will have to be treated, which have been covered up in the past with many ""beauty operations"". Since we do not want to look for a receiver for Ljubljana in the next regular mayoral elections, we need to elect a good steward in this one - one who will spend money for the benefit of all Ljubljana citizens, who will conscientiously manage the city's land, who will carefully protect the reputation of public companies, who will carry out tenders transparently, who will select contractors responsibly and who will make sure that every subcontractor is paid fairly. The New Slovenia and the Slovenian Democratic Party are behind all of the above, as they have already demonstrated by their performance in the City Council. <p/> Mojca Kucler Dolinar concluded her announcement of her candidacy for Mayor of Ljubljana with her desire to show an alternative to what has happened in Ljubljana so far that is good, effective and puts the people of the capital at the centre. <p/> Dragutin Mate, President of the SDS City Committee, endorsed Dolinar as an excellent candidate who knows Ljubljana very well and has a lot of experience, which is a guarantee that she will be a good steward of Ljubljana and that she will introduce the necessary changes to improve the lives of the citizens of Ljubljana. He stressed the cooperation of both parties in the preparation of the programme. <p/> Anton Kranjc, representative of the NSi City Committee, stressed that Kucler Dolinar is the best choice at this moment because she has experience, she knows how to lead, she knows how to communicate. She knows exactly what is right and what is wrong, and she stands for honesty and sincerity. <p/> City Councillor Anže Logar (SDS) pointed out that Kucler Dolinar has always been an active City Councillor - including as Vice-Chair of the Commission on Mandate Issues, Elections and Appointments, which she now chairs, she supports a lively debate from the point of view of morality and ethics for the benefit of Ljubljana, and would like to see this kind of debate in the City Council as well. In his words, the candidate stands for the power of argument, not for the argument of power. <p/> Minister of Defence Aleš Hojs (NSi) is pleased to see the joint support of the NSi and the SDS. He sees in the candidate the possibility of change for the better and the realisation of the fundamental programme of New Slovenia: ""The word is valid. <p/> Minister Dr Žiga Turk (SDS) stressed that Ljubljana deserves a good mayor who is honest, capable and enthusiastic like Kucler Dolinar. Under her leadership, the city can continue what has been good in the past and break with the bad practices of recent mandates.",Opinionated News,test

The equipment needed for these tests wears out over the years and also becomes obsolete, which is why Bankart's donation is extremely important. The state-of-the-art equipment will also allow them to carry out pleuroscopies - an examination of the ribs. <p/> The representative of Bankart, d.o.o., Mrs Maja Usnik, Director of the Financial and Accounting General Sector, expressed her satisfaction at the handover of the donation that the equipment will make a significant contribution to the quality of bronchoscopy. She concluded by expressing her wish to continue to meet in this way in the future. <p/> The donation was first acknowledged by the professional director, Prof. Dr. Saša Markovič, MD, PhD, Senior Counsellor, who congratulated the staff on obtaining the title of Clinical Department or Tertiary Status of the Department. <p/> The employees of the Clinical Department of Pulmonary Diseases and Allergies are proud of the new title of their unit, which was awarded to them by the Ministry of Health at the end of 2008. When the Golnik Clinical Department of Pulmonary Diseases and Allergies moved from UKC Ljubljana ten years ago, the Centre for the Treatment of Patients with Pulmonary Diseases was established in UKC Ljubljana, initially primarily to meet the needs of UKC Ljubljana. Initially, only three doctors were employed to provide a consultancy service for UKC Ljubljana, treating patients in 15 beds. With a great deal of enthusiasm and self-denial, together with the nursing and non-medical staff, they have achieved significant development over 10 years. In addition to hospital activities, they have started a specialist outpatient clinic, which sees 8,000 patients a year. Invasive diagnosis of lung diseases has been redefined. Research activities have been developed. They have published a large number of articles in the foreign and national literature. They lecture at national and international professional meetings. They have made a significant contribution to the educational activities of the Faculty of Medicine. The most important areas of their work are: diagnosis of patients with lung cancer, patients with diseases of the ribs, patients with sarcoidosis and patients with pulmonary hypertension. Last but not least, they are the main Slovenian centre for the management of patients before and after lung transplantation. Of course, they also treat patients with all other lung diseases from the Ljubljana region, of which there are not a few. <p/> At the closing ceremony, Erna Kos Grabnar, Chief Nurse of UKC Ljubljana, emphasised that the staff would certainly not have been so successful if they had not worked so well together, as they are considered a friendly and highly qualified team, where the cooperation between doctors, nursing staff and others is at an enviable level.",Other,test

399,"The seventh solo book by Metka Klevišar, a physician and journalist, Goreči grm (Burning Bush), was published by the Celjska Mohorjeva družba. Together with it, the correspondence between St. Vincent and St. Ludovika, collected and edited by Sister Cveta Jost, and a reprint or revised edition of Robert Cvetek's book on trauma, The Pain of the Past, were presented today. <p/> What all three books have in common is that, as Andrej Arko, the editor-in-chief of the publishing house, put it at the presentation, television programmes and the press do not talk about. That human life is not perfect, that it contains not only achievements but also failures. <p/> Klevišarjeva found the inspiration for her book The Burning Bush among her notes on spirituality in the dying, but it made more sense to her to talk about spirituality in everyday life - and that is the subtitle of the book. She believes that spirituality is everyone's business, whether they are religious or not, and whatever their faith. She wanted to convey in a simple way that spirituality is ""the mystery of life, which we cannot explain, but each person interprets in his own way"". <p/> The book Letters of St Vincent to St Ludovica was published on the occasion of the 350th anniversary of the deaths of St Vincent de Paul and St Ludovica de Marillac. In collaboration with the Daughters of Christian Charity - the Daughters of Charity, of which St Ludovica was the founder, a Sister of that Order, Cveta Jost, has collected and edited the 421 surviving letters written by St Vincent to St Ludovica. The correspondence, she says, is a valuable document of the times, revealing the misery of 17th-century France and the efforts of both saints to improve the lives of the poorest of the poor. <p/> Robert Cvetek's painful past resonated with readers, and the Celje Mohorjeva družba has published a reprint or slightly revised edition. The book deals with trauma, interpersonal relationships, family and therapy and is, as the author's colleague Katarina Kompan Erzar from the Franciscan Family Institute said, ""an attempt to talk about things that are manageable"". The work does not only present the dark side of living, but also the good news: research shows that trauma can be overcome.",News/Reporting,test

411,"How harmful is one cigarette? <p/> Doctors warn of dangers of a single cigarette <p/> Anyone who thinks that an occasional cigarette won't harm them is honestly mistaken. So-called ""social"" SMOKING and passive SMOKING, i.e. SMOKING where you inhale cigarette smoke from other smokers, can also be harmful to your health. These are as dangerous to the blood vessels, heart and lungs as regularly SMOKING several cigarettes a day. <p/> People tend to fear lung cancer when they smoke, which usually takes years to develop, but cigarette smoke starts poisoning our bodies with its 7,000+ chemicals as soon as we take our first ""smoke"". Damage is caused to the cells of almost every organ. ""That one smoke can be the cause of a heart attack,"" explains Regina M. Benjamin, a well-known American surgeon who advises people to avoid smoking, as well as second-hand smoke. <p/>A recent report on the impact of cigarettes and cigarette smoke says that any inhalation of cigarette smoke is harmful to health. Dr Terry Pechacek from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention warns of the dangers of passive smoking. Inhaled cigarette smoke immediately enters the bloodstream and changes its chemistry, making the blood more sticky and putting it at immediate risk of clots, especially if the person has a pre-existing blood vessel problem. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemicals, 43 of which are known carcinogens. There are also several toxins in the smoke, such as nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, ammonia, etc. Within six seconds of inhaling cigarette smoke, nicotine reaches the brain. In small amounts it acts as a stimulant, but in larger amounts it already interferes with brain function and affects the heart, blood vessels and hormones. <p/> L&M makers reveal cigarette ingredients <p/> An American tobacco company has revealed a long-kept secret about the ingredients in L&M cigarettes, which are also available on Slovenian shelves. The move by the Liggett Group follows efforts by the state of Massachusetts to require all manufacturers to disclose all cigarette ingredients on cigarette packs, which most tobacco factories have so far resisted. Liggett believes that every consumer has a right to know what they are buying. In addition to tobacco and water, L&M cigarettes contain high fructose corn syrup, sugar, natural and artificial liquorice flavour, menthol, artificial milk chocolate, valerian root extract, molasses and vanilla extract and cedarwood oil. There is also glycerol, propylene glycol, isovaleric acid, hexanoic acid and 3-methyl-pentanoic acid.

The work was carried out from 19 June to 15 July 2006 as part of the compulsory field course for archaeology students. <p/> The house, known as Vodiškar's House, stands on the edge of the terrace of the Nevljica stream. The oldest part of the building, the house, is built of wooden logs and is dendrochronologically dated to between 1580 and 1600. The wooden structure is set on a stone cellar, which is dug into the bank. In the 18th or 19th century, a stone vestibule with a black kitchen and a room or stiblc was added to the east of the house. The whole, now three-part building was then plastered. The building was covered with a thatched roof, which was removed in the 1970s. Due to the poor load-bearing capacity of the walls, the new roof was supported on free-standing concrete piers on the north and west sides. <p/> In 2004, as part of the planned renovation of the outside of the building, the owners machine-excavated drainage ditches along the walls and removed the plaster on the wooden part of the building. A larger, irregularly shaped construction pit was dug along the west façade of the building, which extended below the level of the basement foundations. One or more cultural layers were removed, which contained a large number of pottery fragments dating from the High Middle Ages, animal bones and charcoal. However, large quantities of modern pottery, glass shards and metal objects were found throughout. <p/> Archaeological excavations were then carried out prior to the resumption of construction works, but were limited to a few selected small areas due to the previous destruction of the stratification and for static reasons. <p/> The southern part of the stile was partially excavated, where the owners had already removed the weathered wooden floorboards before the excavations began. Under two layers of fill with finds from the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, we found a light brown screed of sand, soil and lime up to 6 cm thick. It showed clear signs of wear and was smeared with mud and soot from the Black Kitchen. It was laid directly on the sterile subsoil of the site, which consists of thick gravel and sand deposits. The foundations of the stone walls of the shingle were shallowly dug into it, only about 10 cm deep. Small finds suggest that the hill was built over in the 18th or early 19th century. A test excavation in the courtyard along the eastern wall of the fortress showed that the courtyard had been flattened when the fortress was built, thus completely destroying the older stratification. <p/> The area in front of the wooden door along the north wall of the house, the presumed original entrance to the building, was also investigated. The strip between the wall of the house and the roof struts was filled in and partially levelled with thick stones, sand, building materials and household waste when the new roof structure was built in the 1970s. Below were some earth layers associated with the construction of the extension with the black kitchen and the tiled stove. The foundation of the stone wall behind the pottery oven was dug 50 cm deep through the thick rubble of an 80 cm wide dry wall, which ran parallel to the northern wall of the cellar or house at a distance of 1.40 m. The wall may have formed the foundation of an enclosed extension next to the house or may have merely served as a truss to consolidate and level the walking surface in front of the former entrance to the building. To the north of the wall, we documented two wooden uprights, possibly supporting the pitched roof, the existence of which is evidenced by three cut-outs for the supporting beams in the north wall of the house. The excavated wall and the stone wall of the cellar were dug into the sterile base of the site. To the north of the drystone wall, several successive earth deposits with numerous modern finds were excavated. In the westernmost part of the excavation site we documented several layers overlying the bank here, containing fragments of High Medieval pottery. <p/> The large machine excavation in front of the cellar entrance on the west side of the building was only cleaned and levelled due to the static threat to the west wall of the cellar. In the western profile, we documented, among other things, three layers with High Medieval finds. The pottery is virtually identical to the finds from the older phase of the castle at Malé grad in nearby Kamnik and can be tentatively dated to the 11th or 12th century, the time when the village of Nevlje, next to the old parish church, began to develop.",Information/Explanation,test
451,"US urges Romania to defend independent judiciary <p/> Bucharest, 11 January (STA) - The United States today urged Romania to defend the rule of law and expressed concern about attacks by politicians on the independent judiciary. Victoria Nuland, US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, criticised the Romanian authorities and warned that ""an independent judiciary is essential for a strong democracy"" during a visit to Bucharest. <p/> After years of total impunity, several high-ranking Romanian politicians, including former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, have been convicted of corruption and landed in prison in recent years. This shows, according to analysts, that the independence of the judiciary in this Balkan country, which has been an EU member since 2007, is strengthening, albeit slowly. <p/> ""You have made great strides forward, especially in the last five years, and I call on all Romanians (...) to fight even harder to defend the independence of the judiciary and to keep it out of politics,"" the high-ranking US guest stressed today in Bucharest after a meeting with Romanian President Traian Basescu and Foreign Minister Titus Corlatean, the French news agency AFP reports. <p/> The Austrian news agency APA adds that the Romanian authorities, expecting harsh words, had already warned the US before the visit not to raise the issue of Romanian justice and reminded that Romania is not an American colony. But this did not seem to stop Nuland. <p/> Her words referred to the Romanian Parliament's attempt to provide a kind of ""super-immunity"" to MPs and local politicians by amending the Penal Code and the law on amnesties and pardons. This would also protect incumbent politicians from possible corruption charges. In addition, politicians already convicted of corruption could be pardoned, APA writes. <p/> The US immediately branded the attempt at the end of December as ""a step away from transparency and the rule of law"", while the EU and several of its members, including Germany and France, also expressed concern. In the end, Bucharest only caved in under pressure and postponed the adoption of the law until February, but it has not yet been abandoned. <p/> Further discontent was caused by statements by Socialist Prime Minister Victor Ponta, a sworn opponent of the conservative President Basescu, in which he accused the special prosecutor for the fight against corruption, DNA, and the integrity body, ANI, of being subject to the ""Basescu regime"" and of ruling unfairly. Last week, the Prime Minister even compared the recent second corruption conviction of Nastase to the imprisonment of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko in Ukraine. <p/> The situation in Romania was most acute last year, when Ponta's centre-left coalition tried to oust Basescu by referendum.

The aim is to win three more points to regain top spot in the group two rounds before the end of this competition. <p/> Real Madrid return to the Champions League with the aim of regaining top spot in Group D after their match against Borussia Dortmund (20:45). The Whites will be looking to capitalise on the unconditional support of their fans, who are literally overwhelmed by such Champions League matches and who will be cheering the White Ballet on to an eighth consecutive European victory at the Santiago Bernabeu. The Spanish league champions and top scorers in this year's Champions League will take on the winners of last year's Bundesliga and one of the few teams still undefeated in this year's European competition tonight. The importance of the opponent and the objective of reaching the top of the group again two rounds before the end of this part of the competition makes this match extremely serious and predicts one of the most interesting evenings in European football. <p/> More than a month and a half after their first Champions League match, Real Madrid will play their second match in this competition on home soil. The Whites will take on Borussia Dortmund with the aim of winning and returning to the top of the Group D standings two rounds before the end of the group stage. If they beat the German side, they will lead the standings by two points over Dortmund, but Real then have two more games to play: Manchester City away and Ajax at home. <p/> GROUP D <p/> City <p/> Team <p/> W <p/> N <p/> P <p/> Gd <p/> Gr <p/> Points <p/> 1 <p/> Borussia Dortmund <p/> 2 <p/> 1 <p/> 1 <p/> 0 <p/> 4 <p/> 2 <p/> 2 <p/> 7 <p/> 2 <p/> Real Madrid <p/> 2 <p/> 0 <p/> 1 <p/> 1 <p/> 8 <p/> 5 <p/> 3 <p/> 6 <p/> 3 <p/> 3 <p/> Ajax Amsterdam <p/> 1 <p/> 0 <p/> 0 <p/> 2 <p/> 4 <p/> 6 <p/> - -2 <p/> 3 <p/> 4 <p/> Manchester City <p/> 0 <p/> 1 <p/> 2 <p/> 4 <p/> 7 <p/> -3 <p/> 1 <p/> Another unwavering connection between the team and the fans at the Santiago Bernabeu will help the Whites to reach their goal. At least that has been the case in the last seven games Real have played in this competition. Ajax (3-0), Lyon (4-0), Dinamo Zagreb (6-2), CSKA Moscow (4-1), APOEL (5-2), Bayern (2-1) and Manchester City (3-2) are the opponents who have lost consecutively against the team from the Spanish capital. The goal difference is also consistent with this: Real have scored 27 goals in these matches and conceded only eight. <p/> REAL'S LAST 7 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MATCHES <p/> Opponents <p/> Results <p/> Ajax <p/> 3-0 <p/> Lyon <p/> 4-0 <p/> Dinamo Zagreb <p/> 6-2 <p/> CSKA de Moscow <p/> 4-1 <p/> APOEL <p/> 5-2 <p/> Bayern Munich <p/> 2-1 <p/> Manchester City <p/> 3-2 <p/> ""Benzema will not play, He is injured, but Varane will start the game,"" Jose Mourinho revealed at a press conference. The Portuguese coach has selected 20 players for this match, among which Castilla midfielder Alex stands out. Alex will therefore be joining the first team for the third match in a row. The French striker, on the other hand, will be a notable absentee for Real, but despite that, this team has proven its attacking power on several occasions. In fact, Real's goal scoring in this competition is something to remember. The Real Madrid team has the highest number of goals in this competition (8 goals) and Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored five of them, is currently the top scorer in the Champions League this season. <p/> Borussia Dortmund, Bundesliga champions in the previous two seasons, are not doing so well at home this season, finishing in fifth place with 16 points, 11 behind leaders Bayern. They have four wins, four draws and two defeats so far and drew goalless against Stuttgart in the last round. <p/> MATCHES BETWEEN REAL AND BORUSSIA <p/> IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE <p/> Team <p/> No.T <p/> Z <p/> R <p/> P <p/> Gd <p/> 6 <p/> 4 <p/> Borussia Dortmund <p/> 5 <p/> 1 <p/> 2 <p/> 2 <p/> 2 <p/> 4 <p/> 6 <p/> The German team, which leads the standings in Group D with seven points, ahead of Real Madrid, who have six, arrives at the Santiago Bernabeu with doubts about the performance of Khel, who was hit in the head in his last league game and who trained with a mask at the Stadium of the Whites.

461,"Dragana is in pain and bleeding after sexual intercourse. What are the possible causes of this problem? <p/> A couple of days ago my boyfriend and I had sex. Suddenly I felt a pain from below and after a while I started bleeding quite a lot. It calmed down after three days. It happened again on the fourth day. I have been taking the Logest pill for 5 months. I am 20 years old. I really wonder what it could be? Is it possible that something has broken? <p/> Dragana <p/> You have bled a few times after intercourse. Without an examination, of course, we can only guess what the cause of these bleedings is: * since you have been having sex for quite some time, a genital injury is very unlikely * it could be bleeding from an inflamed cervix * or bleeding after a ruptured ovarian cyst (only theoretically) * or coincidentally, bleeding related to the use of Logest. If the matter has not resolved while you have been waiting for an answer, I recommend that you see your gynaecologist of choice to find out the cause of these symptoms.",Correspondence,test
466,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are usually transmitted through sexual contact. <p/> Formerly known as venereal diseases (syphilis, gonorrhoea, soft chancre and inguinal lymphogranuloma), STDs are now commonly divided according to the agents that cause them. <p/> General protection against STDs is abstinence, fidelity to two uninfected partners, or the use of barrier contraceptives, the best known of which is the condom. There is also a female version of the condom called femidon, but it is practically impossible to buy in Slovenia. <p/> The condom is the only contraceptive that both protects against the transmission of sexually transmitted pathogens and prevents unwanted pregnancy. <p/> The most common sexual infections are fungal and bacterial infections, which most often present in women as vaginal discharge, genital itching, burning pain when urinating. However, many sexually transmitted infections occur without any signs of infection or disease problems (asymptomatic infections). <p/> The possibility of infection should always be kept in mind when having sex. If sex is based on a good knowledge of the partner and mutual trust and fidelity, there is no risk of fresh infection. Of course, the risk is much higher with frequent changes of sexual partners and fleeting sexual contacts (promiscuous sexual behaviour). <p/> Some STIs are briefly described below, while HIV/AIDS, chlamydial infections and hepatitis are covered separately. <p/> Gonorrhoea (also gonorrhoea, thrips) Gonorrhoea is a widespread STD caused by gonococcus. It has seemingly, but unjustifiably, lost its importance due to the success and short duration of treatment. There is no data on the actual prevalence of gonorrhoea for Slovenia because the notification, which is compulsory, is incomplete. <p/> Gonorrhoea is sexually transmitted and mainly affects the genital organs. However, there is also gonorrhoea of the conjunctiva of newborn infants, which is contracted during childbirth if the parturient has gonorrhoea. Therefore, to prevent this type of infection, it is obligatory to protect every newborn with so-called Crede's drops at birth. It is also possible for gonococci to infect other sites outside the genitals and genital tract (buttocks, throat). In the male, after a short incubation period of a few days (i.e. the time between infection and the outbreak of the disease), a discharge from the urethra occurs, accompanied by itching and burning pain when urinating. After about 2 weeks, the acute inflammation becomes chronic. Complications of untreated gonorrhoea in a man include inflammation of the prostate, perimenopause and infertility. <p/> In women, there is virtually no disease in the initial period. There are no early signs of possible infection. <p/> Infection progresses to the internal reproductive organs (uterus, fallopian tubes), which can lead to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. <p/> Syphilis Syphilis is a contagious STD that can affect all organs of the human body. The causative agent of syphilis is a bacterium, Treponema pallidum. More than 95 infections are caused by having sex with an infected person. Non-sexual infections are caused by kissing, biting and other contact with a patient who has skin sores. <p/> Data on the prevalence of syphilis are fairly accurate, as the disease was considered the most severe STD due to its consequences until the emergence of HIV infection. In Slovenia, a dramatic increase in syphilis was recorded in 1994 and 1995 (36-38 per year), with a slight decline in the number of new cases in the following years. <p/> Syphilis is divided into early and late (duration up to 1 year or more than 1 year), and acquired and congenital, depending on how the infection occurred. <p/> The incubation period for syphilis is about 3 weeks. <p/> Early syphilis At the site of penetration of the bacterium into the skin or mucous membranes, a hard, hard-edged, round or oval ulcer forms after three days. The ulcer is most often on the genitals, but can also be on the lips or in the oral cavity. After a few days, the lymph nodes in the area swell, and after 2 months, most of the lymph nodes swell. Later, an itchy rash spreading from the trunk to the extremities appears, which spontaneously disappears after 1 to 2 months, leaving whitish patches. Several months after infection, hair loss may occur with coin-sized bald patches that grow back on their own. <p/> Late syphilis In this form, there are not necessarily changes in the skin, but there are changes in the blood vessels and central nervous system. The disease is proven and later controlled by detecting antibodies in the patient's blood or cerebrospinal fluid. <p/> Congenital syphilis A syphilitic infection in the mother can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, or a child may be born with signs of syphilis. The last case of congenital syphilis in Slovenia was reported in 1986. <p/> It is important to detect syphilis as early as possible to prevent the spread of infection and to increase the success of treatment. The drug of choice is still penicillin. <p/> INFECTIONS WITH PAPILLOMA VIRUSES-GENITAL WARTS Some of the viruses belonging to the papillomavirus group cause genital warts (HPV 6 and HPV 11). The incubation period can be several months. The lesions themselves are harmless (benign), but they are very disturbing, uncomfortable, the treatment is long and painful, and recurrences are frequent. <p/> GENITAL HERPES Infection with herpes simplex type 2 is classified as an STD. The infection causes the formation of tiny vesicles on and around the genital area, which later become purulent. The vesicles appear in the presence of various triggering factors (immunosuppression, stress, illness, menstruation). <p/> Initially, there are only bubbles, but later small sores appear. <p/> Infection with the virus is permanent. If a pregnant woman who has a fresh infection gives birth to a child, she may be at high risk. If symptoms are present at the time of delivery, a caesarean section is performed to prevent infection of the newborn. <p/> Treatment of skin lesions is symptomatic. However, there are antiviral drugs that prevent the appearance of vesicles in people with a high incidence of genital herpes. These medicines are prescribed by a doctor. <p/> FUNGAL INFECTIONS Fungal infections of the genital tract are most commonly caused by fungi of the genus Candida, which are present in small numbers on mucous membranes. They often multiply on the mucous membranes of the female genital mucosa and are passed on during sexual intercourse. Men usually do not have problems, but may develop burning, reddish, partly whitish, penile rashes. <p/> In women, the genital area usually itches, the mucous membrane is red and there is a white, cheesy vaginal discharge. <p/> Creams and vaginal tablets are used for treatment. <p/> Pubic lice Pubic lice live on the hair of the genitals and are transmitted by sexual contact. Lice and nits are found on the hairs. Severe itching occurs. All infected persons must be treated and bed linen must be properly hygienised (wash at 95 degrees C). <p/> CHLAMIDIA INFECTIONS Data on the prevalence of chlamydia infections in Slovenia are unreliable. Despite the fact that it is compulsory to report the infection and that chlamydial infections are among the most common STDs, reporting is not practiced. Chlamydia are very small bacteria, sexually transmitted by Chlamydia trachomatis. <p/> In men, urethral and later perineal inflammation occurs after about 14 days after infection. However, an infected male may be without problems. <p/> Newborn babies become infected at birth if their mother has chlamydia cervicitis. Chlamydia eye inflammation and/or chlamydial pneumonia develop. <p/> The infection is treated with antibiotics. <p/> TRYHOMONIAZA Infection is caused by a protozoan, Trichomonas vaginalis. <p/> In men there is usually no problem, rarely there is inflammation of the urethral orifice and burning pain on urination. In women, after incubation for a few days, a foul-smelling, foamy vaginal discharge appears, accompanied by itching of the external genitalia and pain on urination.",Information/Explanation,test

469,"Tenancy agreement with a person in social need <p/> QUESTION: <p/> We are going to rent out a room in a block of flats with shared use of the bathroom and kitchen to a father of two children (14 and 12 years old). As they are a social problem (no income, in divorce proceedings, etc.), I would like to know how to draw up the "" correct "" rental contract with the father for a period of 12 months or so to solve his problems. Can I throw them out of the house after 12 months, even though they are a social problem? What if something happens to the father, what happens to the children? What if something happens to me and my husband (our children are still of age)? Is the tenant obliged to pay my housing costs? <p/> (D.K.F.) <p/> ANSWER: <p/> We understand from the question that you are renting out the accommodation yourself, not as a social institution. However, vacating the premises by the tenant always involves risks, so we advise you to rent the premises for a fixed period of time, e.g. 12 months, as you say. Before the end of the lease, you should re-let the premises for a longer period. Of course, there is still some risk, especially in your case. Find out whether he will be able to pay you rent at all if he has no income. Consider whether you can approach him to get a rent guarantee from social services if you are really solving social problems. If he has no income and no guarantee, you are of course knowingly increasing your risk. If something happens to the father (the tenant), then the children who have been living with him will continue to rent and the welfare authority will take care of their rights. The costs of the tenancy are paid by someone other than the tenant, and it is advisable to obtain insurance - preferably a guarantee from the social welfare authority - to cover the tenant's obligations.If something happens to you, this has no effect on the tenancy, which is continued by your heirs.",Correspondence,test

523,"In reality, it is hard to imagine the incredible and unimaginable obstacles that a person encounters when seriously ill in a system that is supposed to provide him with protection in the first place. When the normal course of his life and that of his loved ones is suddenly and unexpectedly completely diverted by a serious, unpredictable illness, the outcome of which is sometimes impossible to predict. As if the diagnosis itself were not stressful and painful enough, many dilemmas, problems and questions begin to pile up, and the answers are all too often lost in a systemic maze that seems designed to complicate, complicate and steal hope at a time when, in fact, hope is the only thing left for the person in need. As if the burden of illness were not enough in itself, but the resulting rupture in life had to be echoed by the loss of social security. <p/> The time of the new coronavirus has painfully exposed the difficulties faced by dementia sufferers and their relatives or carers in this country. For these patients, who are slowly but steadily losing touch with reality, care must be all-day, every-day. As we know, this care is already extremely inadequate from a systemic point of view, as the vast majority of the burden falls on the shoulders of the relatives - but, on the other hand, this year's coronary crisis, which is again worsening at an accelerated pace, has shown that there are many more older people with these problems than we imagine. Some of them have either not yet been diagnosed or the disease is still in its early stages, so they were able to cope with the challenges of life until the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic - but when life was turned upside down, when isolation was mandated and normal interactions and social contacts were reduced, the disease surfaced... <p/> In the past, thanks to vaccination, medicine has managed to control a series of epidemics, serious infectious diseases that had previously - including in our own country - extinguished the lives of children and adults en masse. Therefore, today, with the availability of a vaccine against COVID that will be able to stop an epidemic that has been limiting our lives for almost a year, it is pointless to give up on vaccination. These are the warnings of key medical institutions, but of course the decision to vaccinate or not is a personal right and a matter for each individual's judgement. But at any time and in any way, personal freedom on the one hand and social responsibility on the other always end up in the balance. It is therefore impossible to turn a blind eye to the truth that the current epidemic can only be overcome through a common effort, regardless of attempts to politicise and trivialise one of the greatest health and social challenges of the last century. <p/> ""We will be able to cure some cancers for which the next stop would be a cemetery,"" Prof. Samo Zver, Head of the Clinical Department of Haematology at the University Hospital Ljubljana, was unequivocal about the new method of treating blood cancers with CAR-T cell therapy in an interview with Zdravstveniportal.si a year and a half ago.<p/> ""We will be able to cure some cancers for which the next stop would be a cemetery. Of course, he could not have imagined at the time that the road leading to the introduction of a treatment that could save many lives in this time would be so long and complicated. <p/> Since the prices of medical supplies and devices have been significantly higher in Slovenia since independence than in those EU Member States least burdened by corruption - Germany and the Scandinavian countries, for example - nine doctors, united in the zdravstvo.si group, have drawn up a new proposal for the procurement of these supplies. This proposal is intended to put an end to decades of anomalies in this area in our country. But do those in charge in Slovenia really want the money that would otherwise be siphoned off into the supply channels to stay in healthcare? The answer is clear: in this case, too, it has been shown that the corrupt ties that also permeate the decision-making levers in our country are apparently so strong that such improvements cannot be expected any time soon. It is therefore not surprising that this group of doctors no longer wants to take part in such 'games', which in the end hurt patients waiting for diagnosis and treatment the most. <p/> Chronic venous disease is a condition that affects women three times more often than men and is a problem for the majority (around 80%) of the adult population worldwide. <p/> ""It is one thing to have a situation on paper, but it is quite another to have a situation in real life,"" added municipal councillor Anastazija Makorič Bevčar at an extraordinary meeting of the municipal council in Kanal ob Soči, as she stood on the sidelines of more than five hours of expert explanations and the search for credible answers to the question of why the state continues to allow the pollution to cripple the central Soča valley and make its population sicker and sicker. She knows very well what she is talking about: three siblings in her family were lost to the most serious form of cancer, mesothelioma, which is rare in Slovenia and one of the most common in the area where Salonit Anhovo operates, and a fourth died of lung cancer. Today, exactly one week later, the extraordinary municipal session will be followed by an extraordinary session in the National Assembly building in Ljubljana, 130 kilometres away, where members of two parliamentary committees, on health and on infrastructure, environment and spatial planning, will discuss the same topic. <p/> Do you know anyone who has been eating fast food for decades, lighting up cigarette after cigarette, mainly, of course, as he tells himself, to relieve the stress that life throws at him, and in the afternoons, when work commitments are no longer so demanding, he ""indulges his soul"" with a good dose of alcohol, just to meet, as he convinces himself, the challenges that will arise in the home environment - especially now that the epidemic has forced us to spend most of our time with our loved ones, between the four walls of the home, where stories vary from the beautiful and loving to the extremely tragic and brutal? Do you know anyone who prefers to move from such a reality into the virtual world, where they can vent their frustrations and aggressively and arrogantly oppose all that is reasonable, just to satisfy their own powerlessness, which is rooted in ignorance and ignorance, albeit often under a fictitious name and profile? <p/> How is dentistry working, under the circumstances dictated by the now waning second wave of the epidemic? Dentist Dr Diana Terlević Dabić, MD, says that work is going smoothly in her practice in the health centre in Škofja Loka. ""We follow the protocol. We call each patient before the visit, take a medical history, give instructions on how to arrive at the dentist's office. Patients need us - and there are no short cuts in our dental treatment. We see fewer patients, there is no waiting in the waiting room, and we take more time with each patient than we did before the epidemic. In fact, I could say that COVID has helped us to improve our organisation in a unique way."" <p/> In line with the revolt of family doctors, who have recently been stepping up their warnings about the decimation of staff and the resulting overload, including and especially administrative overload, measures to improve the situation in primary care are being taken at an accelerated pace. Today, the Board of Directors of the Health Insurance Fund of Slovenia (ZZZS) gave the green light to the first eight new teams on the basis of this year's call for tenders for an additional 32 general or family medicine clinics and 21 paediatric and school dispensaries. In the Gorenjska region, where the situation is most critical, not a single application has been received; the tender remains open until the end of the year, but further applications will be considered by the ZZZS on a rolling basis. <p/> ""The difficult year 2020, which spared no severe trials, has finally brought good news, with the announcement of a significant gain as we enter the new decade,"" enthuses dentist Dr Sanda Lah Kravanja. After many years of struggle, the Ministry of Health has granted the dental practice in Bovec a concession and an additional programme for orthodontic treatment of children and adolescents from the PoSS region on a referral basis; until now, they could only receive this kind of treatment in clinics located far away, either in Nova Gorica or in Tolmin. <p/> There is no doubt that the epidemic and the related measures are already on everyone's mind. I do not know a single person who does not dream of life returning as soon as possible to the normality we were used to before the pandemic broke out. But the figures on infections, illnesses and even deaths caused by COVID simply refuse to subside. On the contrary, we are facing a third wave, underpinned by new strains of a new coronavirus, and we are once again on the verge of another closure of the country, which, this time, is being advocated unanimously by representatives of the various branches of medicine; it would probably have been the case in any case, regardless of which political option had the most votes at any given time in government decision-making, in determining and directing what happens in the country. This will be put on hold again at the beginning of April - that this is not a premature April Fool's joke is confirmed by the conviction of epidemiologists, infectiologists and representatives of other disciplines that only in this way will it be possible to effectively repel the predicted intense third wave of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections. <p/> On the old continent, an average of 2335 people die every day from a blood clot in the legs or lungs. But while immediate action is essential for arterial thrombosis, where survival depends on every second, venous thrombosis allows a little more time. <p/> The dementia epidemic should also be tackled in this country through comprehensive measures in the context of a network of memory clinics, but these are still not in place, and this progressive chronic degenerative disease is painting an uninspiring picture on the map of Slovenia. The incidence of dementia is rising sharply, disproportionately in line with the ageing of the population - but as many as three-quarters of sufferers are still without a diagnosis to explain why many individuals are slowly losing (their) minds. We will talk about how dementia can be prevented or at least delayed by a few years with very simple approaches, how patients who are diagnosed at an early stage can be helped today, and how to provide support to the relatives of the sufferer who are themselves failing because of overwork and stress, and how far science has come in the search for a cure for Alzheimer's disease and why politics should simply move beyond its short-sighted interests and act in the vital interests of Slovenian society, in an article and video interview with prof. Dr. Zvezdan Pirtošek. <p/> Severe asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, occurs in about 10% of sufferers; it often leads to exacerbations that require the asthmatic to take glucocorticoids in pill form in addition to basic medication. Taking these tablets, which have serious side-effects, does not contribute to a good and safe treatment - on the contrary, it often leads to the development of new conditions. The Slovenian Association of Pneumologists therefore warns that asthma treatment should follow the new professional guidelines for successful treatment and good asthma control, which strongly advise against the use of glucocorticoids in tablet form. <p/> Elevated blood pressure puts people at higher risk of heart and kidney disease, as well as stroke - and, as a result, sudden death. Hypertension is not an uncommon condition, according to data showing that around one third of adults today have high blood pressure, and the condition is increasingly being detected in young people. The problem is that almost half of those affected are simply unaware of this problem, which can have serious consequences - cardiovascular disease is still one of the leading causes of premature death in the population. This is why preventive check-ups, including blood pressure measurements, should not be neglected. <p/> How dangerous and professionally reprehensible must the circumstances dictating a doctor's work be for him to decide - for his own sake and for the sake of his patients - to resign? At the Kranj Health Centre (ZD), 24 doctors have decided to take this truly radical step. There has been a great deal of manipulation in the public domain about this, in the sense that it is really a blackmail for higher salaries or a covert attempt to privatise healthcare. But are such claims, which have found their home mainly on social networks or in politically dictated interludes, to be believed? Listen to the personal testimonies of five doctors from the Kranj Health Centre. <p/> In the treatment of oncology patients, one of the key procedures in modern medicine for determining the course of treatment is molecular diagnostics. It is increasingly indispensable in determining the prognosis of the disease, predicting its recurrence or response to treatment, because in the management of patients with cancer, which is a genetic disease, both molecular diagnostics and genetic markers are nowadays crucial in the choice of treatment tailored to the individual patient and the tumour he or she has to overcome. The regulation on this type of treatment, which is now publicly presented and will be financed from the health budget or from compulsory health insurance as from 1 July, bodes well for oncology patients in this area. <p/> The issue of non-emergency ambulance transports or so-called ambulance transports is not a new problem - on the contrary, it has long been a source of conundrums and ill-will in practice, and it imposes on doctors (personal or so-called referring doctors) a problem that does not depend on medical knowledge, since it is in fact a regulation conditional on the relationship between the insured and the insurer. At the end of December, the Government amended the current regime. <p/> Slovenian scientists have also been involved in the search for a vaccine to protect against SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus infections. The head of the research team at the Institute of Chemistry, Prof. Dr. Roman Jerala, presented the results of the development and pre-clinical testing of a vaccine against COVID-19, for which the Institute spent 10.000- to 100.000 €.000 times less money than was spent on such research in the USA, China or Russia, he stressed that as scientists they simply had to contribute a tiny fraction to the global effort to save the world as quickly as possible from one of the biggest medical disasters in the last 100 years, which will have snuffed out more than 1,000,000 lives by the end of the year.",List of Summaries/Excerpts,test

569,"Today, thinking or the free public use of the mind is once again becoming a matter of survival. Delirium is at the core of the political mainstream. This is also reflected in the sentence uttered by the Finance Minister-designate at Monday's hearing: ""We find ourselves in an extremely challenging situation where, logically, we should be doing something, but we are forced to do the opposite."" Mramor's sentence thus suggests that the incoming government will take decisions that will go against logic, i.e. common sense, and therefore against what would be best for the majority of people. <p/> So the government will continue to follow the delirious path that is deepening the crisis, imposing policies as solutions that have long since been proven to be counterproductive and harmful. Therefore, as long as we allow those who have received their mandate from the people, in their self-confidence and harmful optimism, to continue to take decisions unhindered, not by following the logic of things, but by following its opposite (where the guiding principle becomes the service of this or that private interest to the detriment of the community), a way out of the crisis is neither probable nor possible. <p/> Today's problem is not at all a lack of optimism or even pessimism, as one might think if one were to accept uncritically the statements that people in the highest positions make in the public arena. What is much more problematic at this time is a particular kind of optimism, which is most often expressed by the very representatives of the political and economic elites. <p/> We could get an impression of such optimism listening to the outgoing Prime Minister in an interview on the national television channel. In particular, she praised the past achievements of her government, and then went on to talk, with a kind of barbecue, about how she is convinced that, in the end, we will find a solution to the problem that will arise when the route of the pipeline is decided again, where the interests of Russia and the EU are in conflict (and she herself will have to do a somersault in her future role as Commissioner, representing exactly the opposite position on this issue to the one she held as Prime Minister when she met the Russian gas tycoon), which will definitely make the future bright. <p/> Her completely uncritical rant, which was also without a hint of feeling for the difficult situation in which many families and individuals in this country find themselves, having to deal with questions about how to get through the month on a daily basis, is not an isolated case, though. Optimism has become quite commonplace in the speeches of politicians, although it is difficult to show that it actually accompanies action to improve the quality of life of citizens - it often appears precisely in the absence of any substance, or when someone in a position of responsibility is rightly expected to make a constructive proposal or take a very concrete step (because that is what they are elected to do), and yet, by waxing lyrical, they are hiding the fact that they have no idea of how to tackle the most acute problems. <p/> One of the most optimistic politicians here is certainly the President of the country himself. In a recent speech, he said this: ""If we are smart, brave and composed enough, we can now finally turn things around. Over time, people's living standards will rise again, our confidence in the country's legal and political institutions will be strengthened and an encouraging, optimistic mood will return."" What exactly is the basis for such optimism? What - apart from fine words - is there here to inspire credibility? What political solutions to one of the most serious problems, such as the growing poverty among the population and the immense enrichment of a minority, are promised in the actions of the incoming government? What reason for optimism should we have in view of the fact that the unemployment rate has not changed significantly and that there is no prospect of any beneficial changes any time soon (and with the statements of the future Finance Minister, there are perhaps even fewer reasons for such optimism)? <p/> On the side of those in power today, the trend is one of optimism and overconfidence, which could more accurately be described as pathological narcissism, where the rest of us are reduced in their eyes to a passive audience that is merely there to validate their inflated egos (the various fights for the post of Commissioner and the self-aggrandisement of who is better suited for it are a sign of this very phenomenon). <p/> It may seem to some that, since we still do not have a prescription for how to build a democratic society, it is best to leave things to those who have already ""screwed up"" many things in the past (just think how many members of parliament and even of the incoming government have formed past ""fallen"" governments, and have now been given a mandate again for the next few years), since they are at least old acquaintances on the political scene (and should therefore know how to go about the management of common affairs). <p/> Some change of mind is needed. Derrida's idea of democracy implies that democracy is a process that is also a learning process: democracy is the happening, the practising or learning of democracy. So the (democratic) communion has yet to be invented or inventing. An honest attitude is therefore not the flimsy optimism of a Pahor or Bratušek, but anything but. It requires a lot of thinking, intellectual work and experimentation, trying out the ways in which people organise their daily lives in community. And that means that it will only be possible when people try to live it, to put it into practice, to practise it, and therefore when they come to the debate without asking the authorities for permission. Democracy cannot be taught to the people, nor is it necessary. But a certain amount of self-reliance is certainly in order. It is probably true that any political engagement requires a great deal of thought, study and insight into many complex issues, but that does not mean that one should remain silent until someone gives the floor and allows one to speak up. Democracy cannot be some once-and-for-all status quo brought to the people by a good man like Santa Claus. This is why Derrida stressed that democracy is always its own promise, something that is always yet to come (if people work for it, of course). <p/>The biggest obstacle to democratisation and engagement is not ignorance at all, because Socrates already knew that it is in fact the privileged place of the production of all possible knowledge. The greatest obstacle to both the spiritual or mental progress of the individual and the progress of the community towards the common good is the arrogance that is everywhere today in the words of the most influential politicians and other members of the elite. Listening to politicians of the highest rank, from the President of the European Commission to prime ministers and economists of the international financial institutions, one gets the impression that they all know the solutions, we just have to let them implement them. (And then, when these people are actually given a free hand, more often than not, the opposite happens: problems are potentiated, because their ""solutions"" become the real problems - just remember t. (This is because such arrogance is akin to stupidity, which invariably has very concrete (and most often disastrous) effects on the people who are forced to live under its rule. This is also why it is necessary to shake off the prejudice that the ruling class always knows what it is doing. (All we can do, then, is to leave it alone in its self-delusion and join in the optimism it calls us to). This prejudice is also supported by the view that, in the circumstances, it is best to keep to oneself and mind one's own business, which then leaves the people on the political periphery as a more or less helpless bystander. <p/> The process of democracy therefore necessarily coincides with resistance to whatever makes it impossible (today, this is especially capitalism and its sadistic imperative to increase and centralise profits). Resistance is therefore logical, rational, in the name of logic. But without a critical attitude and a systematic use of doubt (especially when we are confronted with the statements and actions of agents of power), we cannot speak of democracy at all. <p/> Much more than simulated optimism, what we need is resistance in the name of logic, i.e. of mental action: this coincides here with an unshakable trust in the power of intelligence, i.e. in man's creative capacity and power to produce new ideas (such a trust has been contemplated by Enlightenment philosophers from Socrates and Plato to Spinoza and Descartes and Kant and Derrida...), which will, as an important part of the process of democracy, determine the shape of the world to come.",Opinion/Argumentation,test

592,"Objectivity in the age of gifts <p/> We all like to receive gifts, and many of us like to give them too. It is only right that a gift should reflect a sincere desire to show appreciation and affection to our neighbour. It is nice if the gift surprises and inspires us with a sense of playfulness, mystery, joy and gratitude. Unfortunately, gift-giving too often degenerates into an alienated, routine and disembodied following of customs. Some gift-givers even see gifts as something that belongs to them, which, when expectations are too high, can lead to ingratitude, disappointment and, eventually, resentment. <p/> A good year ago, the legislator gave us a gift. It made part of the performance-related salary tax-free. But it did so in such a veiled and disguised way that we sometimes wonder whether it was sincere in its intention, because the tax gift announced with fanfare has two flaws that the uninitiated tend to overlook. This is because the payment is not exempt from all taxes, since only income tax is reduced and social contributions are not. And such contributions are not exactly a negligible burden in our country. Moreover, the tax-advantaged payout is not for everyone, but only for those who are successful in business. Business performance is usually determined on the basis of balance sheet data, but this is only finally known in the first quarter of the new financial year. <p/> On the basis of such a muddled solution, some Pharisees can now provoke and blackmail, while the ignorant and deluded demand and resist. A collective performance award is not a gift at the end of the calendar year and must be distinguished from Christmas presents or be properly justified and linked to past performance. <p/> It is right to welcome any gift, including tax gifts.

606,"Caracinids <p/> They have no common body feature by which they can be definitely identified.They are elongate in shape, and the size of the head is small relative to the body. The size varies widely, from less than a centimetre to over half a metre. The colour diversity is equally varied, with over 1000 species known. <p/> This family is characterised by gentle and peaceful representatives (e.g. various species of tetras - neonids, fireflies, serpa....).On the other hand, this family includes true predators, with an extremely strongly developed jaw and sharp teeth (e.g. most species of piranha).The caracinids are gregarious fish, living either in large schools or small groups, but in any case they are not solitary.

They breed freely, which means that they deposit their eggs freely in the water.They usually do not care about their offspring and most often eat most of the eggs themselves.If we want to breed them, we have to make sure that the parents do not get to the eggs.In professional breeding, special nets are used for this purpose, but it is enough to put a little thicker aquarium sand at the bottom of the spawning aquarium, among which the eggs fall after spawning. <p/> Serpa is a fiery red colour, the colouration depends largely on the conditions in which it lives, in darker aquariums its colour is more pronounced.It is a pronounced schooling fish, which grows up to 4 cm. <p/> A beautiful fish that has been known in the aquarium trade since 2007 and overnight became the No.1 fish in the aquarium world.",Information/Explanation,test

643,"Demand for timber construction is still generally quite modest for the most part, so it makes sense for countries to encourage it through various measures. <p/> Finland's wood building promotion programme is already showing results <p/> The use of wood in construction has become more popular again in recent years, with some countries promoting it through specific measures. This is also the case in Finland, where a seven-year wood building promotion programme is already showing results. According to Petri Heino, administrator of the programme, key measures include changes in legislation and financial incentives. <p/> Demand for timber construction is still generally quite modest, so it makes sense for countries to promote it through various measures, said Petri Heino of the Finnish Ministry of the Environment. ""Governments can provide, among other things, changes in legislation, financial incentives and the dissemination of good practice examples to promote sustainable construction,"" he said. <p/> In Finland, he said, it is by combining these three measures that progress has been made. ""We have been able to involve a wide range of stakeholders in promotional activities,"" he said, recalling the size and indirect positive effects of the construction sector. <p/> Finns have had subsidies for the construction of wooden houses for several years, and since the beginning of this year the government has increased them further. The amount varies depending on the region; for example, in the Helsinki metropolitan area, the subsidy is €15,000. <p/> In Finland, a specific programme is being implemented under the auspices of the Ministry of the Environment to promote timber construction in the period 2016-2022, which aims, among other things, to foster the growth of an internationally competitive timber construction industry, both in terms of know-how and domestic production, and to support the sustainable use of forest resources. <p/>The programme's objectives include a ten per cent annual growth in the construction of wooden residential buildings, as well as an increase in the carbon sequestration potential of wood products, the share of wood in public buildings and the export of wood products. ""The mid-term review of the results, carried out in 2018, showed that the activities have had a positive impact in most of the target areas,"" Heino pointed out. <p/> The use of wood in construction is commonplace in Finland, he said, as they have extensive forests that are producing more annual growth than ever before. It is currently at around 110 million cubic metres, of which between 65 and 70 per cent is felled. <p/> Young Finns are also aware of the importance of wood. According to Hein, a recent study showed that 69 per cent of girls between the ages of 14 and 23 support the idea of increasing wood use. <p/> Slovenia is also working to further promote wood as a renewable resource and an opportunity to enhance the added value of products. Among other things, the country aims to achieve a 30% share of wood in public buildings and to increase domestic log processing to three million cubic metres per year. <p/> Heino said that while the starting points are encouraging, it will be useful to further address these issues in the future through changes in legislation, educational content and various policies. <There are also opportunities for cooperation between the two countries. ""There is already informal cooperation at ministerial level, and we are also cooperating in the research field, where there are opportunities to build on,"" he added.",Opinionated News,test
645,"Japan - Kyoto and Geishas <p/> The English writer, explorer, photographer and naturalist Isabella Bird once wrote that Japan offers as much novelty as a trip to another planet. From imposing shrines surrounded by fairy-tale forests, to snow-capped Mount Fuji, to shy and agile geishas, to neon-lit skyscrapers, to punctual and fast trains, Japan conjures up many associations... Japan is a unique synthesis of the traditional and the modern, where ancient gods, traditions, skills and arts meet cutting-edge modern technology, futuristic fashion and the latest style and design. Japan is a country that is a feast for all the senses. Japan was still feudal in the second half of the 19th century, but at the end of that century, rapid industrialisation began. But after the Second World War, Japan emerged as a true economic giant. <p/> Kyoto <p/> The former imperial capital boasts many temples, palaces, shrines and gardens. Kyoto is also famous for its highly developed traditional arts and festivals. Kyoto was the imperial capital of Japan from 794 until 1868, when Meji moved it to Tokyo. Nevertheless, Kyoto retains the primacy of Japan's cultural sophistication. In a way, Kyoto is complementary to Nara, where the foundations of traditional Japanese culture were laid, culminating in Kyoto. Kyoto has a huge number of attractions, so I will concentrate only on the most important ones. <p/> Kiyomizudera <p/> The Temple of Pure Water - Kiyomizudera - is one of the most important temples in Japan and is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was founded in 778 on the site of the Otowa Waterfall in eastern Kyoto. The main temple as we see it today was built in 1633 by the shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu, who, among other things, expelled all Europeans and Christians from Japan and closed the borders of Japan, which lasted for more than 200 years afterwards. The temple was built without a single nail. Kiyomizudera Temple is best known for its 13-metre-high wooden platform, which offers visitors a fine view of the many cherry and maple trees as well as the city of Kyoto in the distance. Below the temple is the Otowa Waterfall, which is divided into three smaller waterfalls. The water from each waterfall has its own health and well-being benefits. You can drink the water from a cup located on a long wooden pole. The water of the first waterfall is good for long life, the second for success in school and life and the third for happiness and love in life. But don't be partial, you can only drink the water of one ""waterfall"". <p/> Behind the main hall of the Kiyomizu Dera Temple stands the Jishu Shrine, dedicated to the deity of love and matchmaking. In front of the temple there are two stones 18 metres apart. If you can find your way from one to the other with your eyes closed, you will be lucky in your search for love, but if you need someone to guide you from one stone to the other, you may also need an intermediary in your search for a life mate. <p/> The Higashiyama district is one of the best preserved old areas of the city, located between Kiyomizu Temple and Yasaka Shrine. Walking through the narrow streets, between the wooden buildings and traditional shops, it's easy to feel the flavour of the old capital. Many small shops and restaurants have catered for locals, tourists and pilgrims for centuries. On a walk through the quarter, we also caught a geisha going about her business, and she was happy to pose for us. <p/> 1 of 3 <p/> Kodaiji Temple, founded in 1606 in memory of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of Japan's greatest historical figures, and commissioned by his wife Nene, is also remarkable. <p/> Toyotomi Hideyoshi was a warrior, politician, samurai, general and daimyo - a nobleman subject only to the shogun - who had 26 famous Christians crucified, known as the Japanese martyrs. Kodaiji Temple belongs to the Rinzai sect of Zen Buddhism. The temple is surrounded by gardens and we also walked through a beautiful bamboo grove. <p/> One of Kyoto's most famous shrines, Yasaka, is only a good half hour's walk from Kiyomizu Temple, but of course the walk takes a while, and we could easily have stayed here for an hour longer. The shrine was founded around 650 AD. In front of the main shrine there is a stage with hundreds of lamps that light up in the evening. Each lamp bears the name of a local company that pays a donation. <p/> Fushimi Inari Shrine <p/> Fushimi Inari is an important Shinto shrine in the southern part of Kyoto. It is famous for its thousand orange or brilliant red torii, which lead through the forest to the 233-metre-high Inari Sacred Mountain, an integral part of the shrine. <p/> Fushimi Inari is one of the most important of the thousands of shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto goddess of rice. The shrine is also full of statues of foxes, which were the messengers of the goddess Inari. Fushimi Inari Shrine is of ancient origin and existed before Kyoto became the capital of Japan in 794. <p/> 1 of 4 <p/> Arashiyama <p/> Arashiyama is a pleasant tourist district on the western outskirts of Kyoto. The area has been a popular destination since Japan was given its first permanent capital, Naro, in 710. The capital at the time flirted with the Chinese capital. Large Buddhist temples were built at this time. Chinese influence was diminishing, although it was still great, or rather many things were submerged. Perhaps the first association we have with Arashiyama is the extremely attractive bamboo forest. <p/> The most important temple in Arashiyama is Tenryuji. It is one of the five great Zen temples of Kyoto and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This temple also has its own Rinzai Zen school of the Rinzai sect of Japanese Buddhism. The temple was built as early as 1339, when the Shogun Ashikaga Takauji ruled, and was dedicated to the then deceased Emperor Go-Daiga. A walk along the pond and through the temple's tatami trees is a real Arashiyama experience. <p/> Golden Pavilion - Kinkakuji <p/> The Golden Pavilion - Kinkakuji is a Zen temple whose upper two floors are entirely gilded with gold leaf. Previously known as Rokuonji, the temple was the resting villa of Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, and according to his will, after his death in 1408, it became a Rinzai sect Zen temple. In front of the temple is a beautiful pond. The temple has burned down several times in its history, most recently in 1950 by a fanatical monk, but was rebuilt again in 1955. <p/> Kyoto Imperial Palace <p/> Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence of the Japanese Imperial Family until 1868, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo. It is located in Kyoto's Imperial Park, along with the Sento Imperial Palace and several other landmarks. <p/> The present Imperial Palace was rebuilt in 1855 after it burnt down. The complex is surrounded by walls and ramparts, with halls and gardens inside. Only the current Emperor Akihito was crowned in Tokyo, the previous ones in Kyoto. <p/> Of course, there are more temples and sights. Kyoto is also famous for its geishas, of which there are around 300, including at least two Europeans.",Opinion/Argumentation,test
646,"The Secret World of Geisha <p/> A geisha is a Japanese artist who presents traditional Japanese arts. <p/> On our trip to Japan, we saw their dances and learned about some of the Japanese arts. <p/> The term geisha is made up of the words GEI (arts or arts) and SHA (person), comes from the Tokyo dialect and has been adopted from there into European languages. Geisha is called hangyoku (semi-precious stones) in Tokyo and maiko (dancing girl) in Kyoto during training. <p/> Geisha flourished most in the 18th and 19th centuries, when their services were in great demand. After Meiji came to power, their role in preserving traditional Japanese art changed. <p/> As early as at least the 7th century, Japan was known for female artists known as saburuke, or what might be called maids. They were girls and wives who were left alone, husbands and boyfriends lost in fights and battles. Somehow they had to survive, some selling sexual favours, while others, more educated, made a living entertaining guests at high society social gatherings. When the Emperor moved to present-day Kyoto in 794, the conditions were created for the start of Japanese geisha culture and soon afterwards these girls became synonymous with the beauty-obsessed elite. <p/> In traditional Japanese culture, men were not restricted from being faithful to their wives. The ideal wife, even of the upper classes, was a modest mother and head of the home. According to Confucius, love is of secondary importance. Men sought sexual pleasure and romantic liaisons not from their wives but from courtesans. From the 17th century, the shogunates had their pleasure quarters, outside of which prostitution was illegal. In these quarters, the yoyo ""actresses"" were ranked and licensed. The highest class of yujois, the forerunners of the geisha, were called tayuuje. They were both actresses and prostitutes, performing erotic dances and skits. <p/> In the 18th century, geisha appear. These pleasure quarters soon became glamorous entertainment centres offering more than just sex. The highly sophisticated courtesans of these districts entertained their clients by dancing, singing and playing music. Some became renowned poets and calligraphers. Gradually, they specialised in a new profession and pursued art and entertainment. The first geishas were men who entertained waiting customers to meet the most popular and talented courtesans. <p/> The rise of the geisha began at the end of the 18th century. Geishas worked in pleasure quarters, were actually imprisoned and were strictly forbidden to sell sexual favours to protect the business of courtesans. While licensed courtesans provided men with sex, geishas occupied a special niche as artists and learned female companions. <p/> At the turn of the 18th to the 19th century, geisha became a female profession and the notorious courtesans went out of fashion. Soon geisha developed their own style of dress and their trends were emulated by fashionable women from all walks of Japanese society. Geishas also began to rank, with some geishas still offering sexual favours, while others strictly entertained their guests with art. <p/> The geisha were dealt a severe blow with the end of the Second World War, when a general mobilisation was declared in Japan and everyone had to work in the fields and factories. Geishas also lost their reputation because some prostitutes pretended to be geishas when they met American soldiers. After the war, few returned to the geisha districts, rejecting the Western influence and returning to their traditional way of life and art, because the status of geisha was shaped by Japan's feudal past, and they maintain the traditional standards of their profession by this way of life if they want to remain geisha. <p/> There is no doubt that in the past, young geishas were also subjected to forced sexual relations and that their virginity was auctioned. After Japan lost World War II, the geishas were displaced and their reputation declined. With Japan's economic boom in the 1960s, the world and the status of geishas also changed. In modern Japan, young geisha are not forced to have sex and their sex life is a private matter. <p/> Is Japan a country where you would go on holiday?

705,"Publishing <p/> DI Kranjska Gora: Visiting elderly and sick members <p/> Chatting. <p/> In addition to these two names, the month of December, or December, has a championship in popular naming. To name but a few: Happy December, the craziest month, the month with the most lonely people, the month with the most holidays, the month with the millions of cards said, the month with the most goodies on the plates, the month with the craziest spending, the month of taking out loans for a few hours of crazy eating, the month of merchants, the month of children's joys, the month of mass temporary resettlement, the month of crazy behaviour, and I could go on and on. <p/> The purpose of my writing, however, is to shed some light on the designation, 'the month with the loneliest'. Why shine a light on something that is always more hidden than revealed? All our disabled people's associations are experiencing more and more members from the third age group. I am not saying that there is no loneliness in the younger groups of people, but it is clear that it is in the group of people in the third stage of life that there is the greatest loneliness. This is the generation that has already finished its working and creative task in life, has gone into the solitude of its retirement. <p/> The fallacy that everyone can hardly wait to retire is only true until you are about to leave your job for good and realise it. You have to leave the comrades who have kept you company for days and years, for better or for worse. The daily commute to work turns into looking out of the window and thinking how my comrades at work are doing. I count myself among the group that it took me two years to accept that I was no longer needed, that I was a tool that had outlived its usefulness. Even though I still had many social tasks and a lot of movement between people, it did not fill me up, so that I did not feel lonely and marginalised. Although I moved among the crowds, I always felt alone. I am not saying that this pattern applies to all of us who have retired, but I know that some of us felt marginalised, exploited in the workplace, and I know that they found it difficult to wait for the arrival of the last day at work. <p/> But this retirement has pushed the vast majority of people into isolation, at least temporarily, until they have found a job in some other area of society, and what if they have not? Usually these are the years when grandchildren come into the world, who somehow fill in society from work, but only temporarily. <p/> Filling time, which is too much at one time, can also lead to an incredible new burden of overwork and lack of time for oneself. This feeling leads to a new isolation, which makes one think that everyone has forgotten one's self and that one is just a tool of one's family or surroundings for as long as one is needed, and then one should get out from under one's feet for once. When, for many, there is the worm that sees that we are only waiting for our miserable end, loneliness reaches a peak that usually leads to a state of illness of mind and body, which is devastating for the individual. <p/> I myself am fortunate in that I am somehow still active in several areas, but it is also true that I always give myself just the right amount of time to myself so that I do not feel marginalised and lonely. But many times the thought creeps into my mind, yes, one day you will have to admit enough is enough, yes it is true, but I am pushing that thought into the future, when it will be, so why bother with it today. <p/> I am also fortunate to run a disabled people's association which employs me. Sometimes the work goes beyond what is reasonable, but that is only sometimes and when the state bureaucracy overreaches itself with tasks that benefit no one and we, through the associations, have to fulfil them. Running a society gives me the opportunity to chat with the membership more and more, which is like the salt of life. Chatting is usually a part or a courtesy of life when meeting people. If the main aim of chatting is to have a positive effect on the relationship and well-being of two or more people together, then I can say that chatting has an impact on the quality of the relationships between the membership. Chatting is typically a game of words. The basic rule of chatting is to strengthen mutual relations with elements of joking, fun, courtesy and to spend time together to avoid excruciating silence and to exchange different opinions on certain problems or events. Chatting has the aim of being friendly to other people and to the surroundings trapped in the same space. <p/> While chatting with the membership, I discover the phenomenon of loneliness of each member. Loneliness can be equated with talent, both components need to be discovered, neither is visible on its own. During December, this phenomenon is even more pronounced and killing. December is a month of anticipation, a month of planning a new path, a month of reckoning with the past tense, but also with the thought, everyone is going to have fun and rejoice, and it will be just me or myself for the holidays and the rejoicing. <p/> This thought leads many into a negative black mentality and even leads the slightly more unstable personalities into the thought of ending a sad life. In the Association we are aware of this situation of some of our members and we are working to raise awareness among the membership that loneliness and exclusion are most often caused by personal reflections and certainly not by social exclusion. <p/> In this month, which has only just begun, the Association of People with Disabilities of the municipality of Kranjska Gora has for years had a campaign to visit individual members who have been passive and more or less inactive over the year. The reason for the visit is usually justified by a small token of appreciation with a few sweets and a souvenir suitable for the December time. All this is cause for a short chat and a chat. <p/> Believe me, such a visit and a gift is the key that not only opens the front door of the home, it is also the key to the heart of the person being visited. A chat usually gives many answers which we had only suspected before. Whatever time our volunteers spend on such a visit, it always turns out in the end to have been too short and too measured. Usually, such a visit turns into indescribable happiness and joy, with the visitor realising that ""I am not forgotten by everyone yet"". I also take part in such visits as much as time permits and it fills me with a certain missing energy that I miss before such a visit, even though I am not even aware that I am missing it. <p/> The people who are visited are also aware of a certain helplessness and loneliness, but they do not know how to help themselves and get out of this cycle of loneliness. This is where our task as the leadership of the association comes in, to find the lonely members and help them to pierce the veil that keeps them in a certain vacuum of loneliness. This is what the mandatory seventh social programme, Preventing and alleviating the social and psychological consequences of disability, requires us to do. <p/> I dare say that we are an association with a good diversification of social work, but all the same we are left with a passive membership that cannot be animated into active membership. How to reach such a member and how to stimulate them is a Gordian knot whose shell we have not even raised, let alone broken. I am also aware that it will never be possible to raise everyone to the level of a working member. I am convinced, however, that we need to do more on this problem of inactivity and the results will come. Let me end my reflections with a greeting that is appropriate in these times, and I wish everyone good luck.",Opinion/Argumentation,test
706,"Dear friend-friend! <p/> We are all too aware of how important it is to pause in the month of December and in the Advent season to reflect on our own lives and our relationship with others. Is it a time to draw a line at what our life has been like in the past year? <p/> It is also a time of planning, when we want to chart a new course for our lives. In fact, it is a time or preparation for tomorrow, for our future. <p/> Therefore, dear members, I wish you and your loved ones a blessed Christmas season, full of faith, hope and love. May the birth of Christ make you happy and give you new hope and courage for tomorrow.

717,"Health Minister Aleš Šabeder sworn in before the National Assembly today, now he will have to speed up the rehabilitation of the health care system, starting with family medicine <p/> By Diana Zajec <p/> Article <p/> Ljubljana, 27 March 2019 <p/> Reading time: 6 min <p/> ""Our current workload is beyond the limits of what is bearable. Despite the difficult situation, we are persevering for the time being, mainly because of the understanding of the management, which is doing its best to find solutions, including by recruiting additional staff, which is not approved and financially covered by the Health Insurance Fund,"" wrote 14 family medicine doctors from the Grosuplje Health Centre in a letter addressed to the ministry today. They did so in the hope that the newly appointed Minister of Health, Aleš Šabeder, will realise that placing the burden on the already pressure-ridden shoulders of family doctors is not a solution. <p/> The doctors from the Grosuplje health centre informed the new Minister of Health, Ales Šabeder, of their decision (to strictly comply with the professional collective agreement and the standards and norms set out therein, and to refuse patients if this would exceed the 1895 head coefficients), the reasons for their decision (to improve working conditions so that they can provide professionally appropriate care to patients) and any further action - including dismissal - if they are subject to any pressure, threats, mobbing or punishment as a result of their decision. <p/> The workload in the outpatient clinics far exceeds the professional standards and norms that are a prerequisite for quality and safe patient care, and all doctors are involved in 24-hour emergency care (both on and off duty), as well as in the post-mortem examination service. <p/> Grosuplje Health Centre doctors will now strictly comply with the professional collective agreement and the standards and norms set out therein - and will refuse new patients if this would exceed the 1895 headache coefficients. <p/> They are convinced that this is the only way to improve working conditions and, as a result, provide patients with professionally appropriate care. <p/> ""In any case, in this situation we cannot and will not take on the additional burden of new registrations as provided for in the new General Agreement, and we have therefore decided to make this public in the attached statement. The statement has been shared with the representatives of the Institution's Council, who have unanimously supported us in this"", wrote Sonja Gruden, a specialist in family medicine, on behalf of the 14 doctors who will give priority to professionalism and ethics. <p/> The decision of the doctors working in the Grosuplje health centre is not an isolated one; similar reactions and announcements have been made in Kranj, Celje, Nazarje, Ajdovščina ... and will be accelerated elsewhere in Slovenia in the future.",News/Reporting,test

725,"Change municipality <p/> For a healthier lifestyle and mental health <p/> New health promotion centre in Celje For a healthier lifestyle and mental health Interest in group workshops and individual counselling <p/> Celje, 28 September 2016 - The Together for Health project was implemented at the National Institute of Public Health in 2015 and 2016 with funding from the Norwegian Financial Mechanism. One of the results of the Together for Health project is a new health promotion centre in the Celje Health Centre and the health posts Štore and Vojnik-Dobrna. The centre is aimed at people who are at any risk due to lifestyle, chronic non-communicable diseases or mental health problems. It offers a wide range of free workshops and individual counselling on physical activity, healthy eating, risky drinking, smoking cessation, living with diabetes, relaxation and stress management, and coping with anxiety and depression. This year, from January to mid-September, more than 1600 individuals were involved in health promotion workshops and individual counselling in Celje, Štore, Vojnik and Dobrna. The oldest participant was 96 years old and the youngest 16 years old. <p/> All services are free of charge for the participants, as they are covered by their health insurance entitlements. At the Health Promotion Centre of the Celje Health Centre, participants receive professional support, relevant information and knowledge, and above all, they form attitudes, acquire skills and develop new behavioural patterns for a healthier lifestyle and mental health. Along the way, they can progress and empower themselves, eventually making some lasting changes in their lives in terms of giving up risky habits. And if they are already ill (for example, diabetics), they can live better with a chronic illness with the experience and knowledge from the workshops. ""We provide preventive check-ups in family medicine referral clinics for all adults over 30 years of age. We aim to detect risk factors for chronic non-communicable diseases (e.g. high cholesterol, high blood pressure, blood sugar, obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, risky alcohol consumption) early enough to prevent the onset of the disease. The Together for Health project has provided the Celje Health Centre with a Health Promotion Centre, where appropriately trained professionals provide group workshops and individual counselling to help adults change unhealthy lifestyle habits. We have focused on implementing a community-based approach, especially trying to reach vulnerable groups of the population and reduce inequalities in health care,"" said Dr Jana Govc Eržen, Head of the Expert Group for Prevention and Health Promotion at the Celje Health Centre, Coordinator of the Celje - Healthy City project and National Coordinator for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention. Marjana Iršič, Head of the Health Promotion Centre at Celje Health Centre, explained. At the Health Promotion Centre in Celje, we have noticed that we have attracted people's interest in our non-medication programmes. Compared to the previous organisation, the new work design also includes vulnerable groups of people in an organised way, for whom some health services were harder to access. As one of the innovations, we have also tested the cooperation with an intercultural mediator for the Albanian-speaking community in Celje."" Vulnerable groups in terms of accessibility to the health system and involvement in prevention programmes include the unemployed, precarious workers, migrants, homeless people, people who use illicit drugs, people with mental health problems, Roma, people with various disabilities and all others who face different barriers to taking care of their health. <p/> The results and benefits of the Together for Health project were presented by health experts and programme users on Wednesday 28 September at the National House in Celje. The new community-based integrative approach to health promotion and prevention was presented by. Alenka Obrul (Director of the Celje Health Care Centre), Dr Jana Govc Eržen (Head of the Prevention and Health Promotion Expert Group at the Celje Health Care Centre and National Coordinator for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention), Jožica Maučec Zakotnik (Head of the Centre for Management of Health Promotion and Prevention Programmes at the National Institute for Health Promotion and Health Care and Head of the Together for Health for Adults Project), Dr. Mgr. Polonca Truden Dobrin (Head of the Together for Health project for children and adolescents), Marjana Iršič (Head of the Health Promotion Centre at the Celje Health Centre), Nuša Konec Juričič (Head of the Non-Communicable Diseases Group at the Celje Regional Unit of the NIJZ), Alenka Rumbak (Director of the Celje Unit of the Employment Service), Martin Kač (Karitas), Suzi Kvas (Director of the Socio Health Care Centre). Stanislava Ferjanc (participant in the programme) and Vera Haliti (intercultural mediator) also presented their experiences. <p/> Users of the Celje Health Centre and the health stations of Štore and Vojnik-Dobrna therefore have the opportunity to take part in one of the three basic workshops: Healthy Living, Am I Fit and Relaxation Techniques. There are also modules on high blood sugar, high fats, type 2 diabetes and physical fitness. These workshops and modules are followed by a variety of in-depth sessions. Among the possible programmes are three in-depth psychoeducational workshops to support mental health: Coping with Stress, Support for Coping with Depression and Support for Coping with Anxiety. ""The workshops provide participants with information on the link between physical and mental functioning, why certain problems occur and what they can do to improve their own health. In a small group, they have the opportunity to share experiences and ask what they are interested in. Excessive or prolonged stress can lead to physical or mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to mental health that makes it harder for many people to seek help - but I think that is slowly changing too. More and more people are recognising the importance of getting information and skills for their own health,"" said Maruša Naglič, psychologist and psychoeducational workshop leader at the Centre for Health Promotion. <p/> Health Promotion Centres, like the one in Celje, are already operating in Sevnica and Vrhnika. In the Together for Health project, led by Jožica Maučec Zakotnik in the field of adult health, the National Institute for Public Health upgraded the existing health education centres both in terms of organisation and content. The approaches are designed to respond to people's needs, with a practical focus on empowerment for long-term lifestyle changes that can lead individuals to better health and well-being. The new design, based on community engagement and the coordinated mobilisation of a wide range of local partners, makes it possible to strengthen care for individual and public health, optimise the use of resources for health promotion and prevention, ensure the quality of staff and programmes, and improve health indicators for the future. The National Institute of Public Health stressed that the experience gained so far from the pilot programmes confirms the rationale for introducing health promotion centres in other health centres. Following the completion of the Together for Health project, the Health Promotion Centre in Celje is fully supported by the National Health Insurance Fund. <p/> *** <p/> Additional information.

The solution is HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound), a treatment that uses focused high-intensity ultrasound technology to heat tissue at a specific depth with extreme, surgical precision, resulting in a direct lifting effect. It is the world's first wrinkle smoother, and depending on the depth of the wrinkle, it is possible to lift the eyelids by 3-4 mm, reduce the pores on the face, firm and lift cheekbones, etc. However, in cases where the eyelid is drooping due to nerve damage or is congenital, the device cannot achieve the changes and surgery is required. Even very pronounced under-eye bags can be reduced, but they cannot be completely eliminated with one treatment. <p/> The excellent results of the HIFU treatment cannot be achieved with any other device or treatment, nor with radiofrequency, mesotherapy or dermapen. However, realistic expectations are necessary, because the kind of taut face you see on Hollywood celebrities is the result of expensive surgical procedures, without which such extreme results cannot be achieved. <p/> The HIFU treatment is performed by a trained beautician who also provides training on this treatment for beauty salons throughout Croatia. So far, she has ""beautified"" more than 150 women from Croatia and Slovenia, so you too can find out why it is worth visiting the Tajna ljepote salon for facial rejuvenation. <p/> This revolutionary and unique device can: completely remove forehead wrinkles, lift eyebrows by 3-4 mm (by lifting the upper eyelids), soften or completely remove wrinkles around the eyes, soften or completely remove under-eye bags, tighten enlarged pores, firm and lift cheekbones, soften or completely remove nasolabial folds and nasolabial folds between the nose and the lip, tighten the skin of the neck, tighten and remove the chin, tighten the skin of the décolletage. <p/> Ultrasound Rejuvenation Treatment High-intensity ultrasound generates large amounts of collagen. After the treatment, the skin is not damaged and does not require recovery. <p/> A single HIFU rejuvenation treatment is enough for great results!",Promotion of a Product,test

Cash payment is already possible if we do not choose another payment type (TRR or card), just a pos printout would be welcome. <p/> As already stated ""if we do not choose another payment type (TRR or card)"", the invoice is entered as cash and is confirmed by FURS. For A4 printout, the invoice prints ok.

If the due date is set to a later date, it will print FOR PAYMENT in the pos statement, but CASH in the A4 statement, and if the due date is the same date as the invoice it will print CASH in both cases. <p/> However, it might be a good idea, if the upgrade is to be made so that the offer can also be used for cash payment and the pos printout, to automatically set the due date for cash payment to the invoice date, or to always print CASH, because we don't print the due date on the cash invoice itself, and it shouldn't be on the A4 printout of the cash invoice, because if we have a due date set for a later date in the offer, the invoice automatically takes it into account, and then the due date is later on the A4 printout, but the cash payment is today, for example.

787,"In mid-August, we will experience one of the most famous meteor showers. Most of them will be seen on the night of 12-13 August 2017. We can expect 40 to 50 meteors per hour, which is less than usual as the Moon will interfere with the observations. <p/> Meteors from a single swarm seem to come from the same point in the sky. Source. <p/> Meteors are visible because tiny dust particles glow as they travel through the Earth's atmosphere at high speed. The average speed at which particles fly through the air is about 59 km/s. At that speed, it would take one second to travel from Ljubljana to Koper, and less than five seconds to travel across Slovenia. <p/> The fear of a meteor puncturing your roof is completely unnecessary, as these particles are so fragile that they burn up high in the atmosphere (over 90 km up).

The brightest bolide can leave trails that remain visible to the naked eye for several minutes in a dark sky. <p/> Comet Swift-Tuttle. Source. <p/> The source of the particles that cause the meteor shower comes from Comet Swift Tuttle, which is still orbiting the Sun today. It is 27 km across and, if placed on Earth, would be about the distance between Ljubljana and Logatec. The orbits of the comet and the Earth are 135,000km apart at their closest point (ten times the diameter of the Earth), making the comet potentially dangerous in principle for a collision with Earth. The comet was observed in China as early as 69 BC and scientists calculate that it will reappear in 2126. The Perseids, also known as the Tears of St Lawrence, were discovered by Belgian Adolphe Quetelet. In 1835, he published that meteors, which are common in August, come from the constellation Perseus. <p/> When to observe?",Information/Explanation,test

855,"Šarec happy with proposal for EU top jobs <p/> Prime Minister Marjan Šarec, arriving at an extraordinary EU summit, said the proposal circulating on the distribution of top jobs was not bad. <p/> Reuters <p/> Marjan Šarec says the proposal he has seen is not bad. <p/> The scenario circulating unofficially is that socialist Frans Timmermans would become president of the European Commission. ""He is certainly a good candidate,"" Marjan Šarec said when asked whether the Dutchman was acceptable to Slovenia. <p/> ""We have now seen a proposal. For me it is not a bad proposal. Even if that were the case, it is a pretty good proposal,"" the prime minister said. But when asked more specific questions, he replied only that it was difficult to describe the details when arriving at the summit. <p/> The proposal was agreed in Osaka, on the sidelines of the G20 summit <p/> An unofficial scenario is circulating that the post of President of the European Commission would go to the Socialists, the post of President of the European Parliament and the high-level foreign policy post to the centre-right European People's Party (EPP), and the post of President of the European Council to the Liberals. <p/> ""They say they have agreed something in Japan. Now, when we sit down, we will see how it goes, and then we will move on. It is difficult for me to say much right now, I can only express the hope that there will be an agreement today or overnight so that the process can move forward and there will not be too long a deadlock,"" Šarec said of the proposal in play. <p/> The Liberals getting the post of President of the European Council seems good to the Slovenian Prime Minister. He did not want to talk about the names, saying that they must first sit down at the table. He also refused to comment on who his favourite or favourite candidate was and whether the Danish Liberal Margrethe Vestager, whom he has so far supported for the Commission presidency, was still in the running. <p/> ""Now we need to hear proposals. I cannot say anything until I am inside and until I see if anything new has happened in the meantime. It's been an hour and a half, something may have changed in that time,"" he said. <p/> Šarec hopes that there will be no blockages, recalling that decision-making does not require pure consensus and that even five years ago not everyone supported the then candidate Jean-Claude Juncker. He feels that it would be good to reach a compromise to some extent, but if this is not possible, then it must be decided by a majority. <On the wisdom of isolating the Visegrad Quartet, which is opposed to Timmermans, he said: ""There is a need for compromise. If there is a majority for an option, the majority will not accommodate some. You know, sometimes on a trip, the bus has to close the door and move on if you are waiting for someone. But I do not want to prejudge. That is speculation. I hope that we will reach a compromise and unanimously choose someone, because that is a better way forward."" <p/> Asked how long they would sit at the table, he replied that he did not know that either and that if he had his way, they would not sit for long. <p/> Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, arriving at the EU summit, predicted difficult negotiations on leadership positions, in particular on the new President of the European Commission, and warned of an institutional conflict between the European Council and the European Parliament.

They work in a targeted way with a specific purpose, such as to strengthen the immune and nervous systems, balance the functioning of the glands and internal organs, increase circulation, maintain psycho-physical vitality, ease depressive states, etc. In addition, they enhance the functioning of the neutral or meditative mind, the faculties of intelligence, perseverance and perfection. A clear, neutral and intuitive mind gives us the ability to become aware of and change our own patterns, fears and habits that prevent us from moving forward in life. <p/> This is why Kundalini Yoga is so appropriate for today, empowering us, uplifting us and building a foundation to cope with the stresses and turbulence of today, a time of moving into the Aquarian Age, an age of higher consciousness and peace. <p/> ""Kundalini Yoga is a technology of knowing and awakening consciousness that leads us to the original Self. Usually this consciousness, which we call kundalini, is dormant within us and therefore awareness and experience of the Self is more or less limited. Awareness can be awakened and expanded up to Infinity and only then can I experience my true Self. Infinity is my original Self. In this expanded state nothing is lacking.

Honda has announced that it plans to double car production over the next five years, with a large number of new models expected to come to market, including in segments where it is currently absent. <p/>Honda's CEO Takanobu Ito said a few days ago that Honda plans to increase production to six million vehicles a year over the next five years from the current 3.1 million, with a number of new models planned, including in segments where it has not been present so far. <p/> Honda is therefore expecting a lot from the all-new generation of the Jazz, as well as from its smaller brother, the Brio, which will be aimed primarily at developing markets and will be a cheaper version of the aforementioned Jazz. To boost production, Honda plans to build new plants, one of which will be opened in Mexico by 2014, and will also focus on the Chinese market, where it plans to launch a maximum of 10 new models. <p/> The fate of the Accord in the European markets is still unknown, as Honda is not confident about the sales and profitability of the model in the old continent (photo: Honda) <p/> Much fewer new models in Europe <p/> While it is not yet known which of the new models will also enter the markets of the old continent, among the models announced are, in addition to the aforementioned brio and jazz, a smaller suv based on the latter, as well as a smaller sedan, which will be a replacement for the current Honda city. <p/> A sporty civica rally car has also been announced, which will, as usual, be given the Type-R nameplate, but enthusiasts will still have to wait until 2015 to get their hands on it. Much more numerous in terms of sales, however, will surely be the announcement of the new generation Accord, whose production for European markets is still in question for the time being, since the Accord has been a loss-making car in most European markets over the last few years, thanks to the strong yen. The same (unknown) fate in the European markets for the time being also awaits the A0 segment model, which will be called N-ONE in the Japanese markets. Among the models announced, we must not forget the NSX sports coupé, as well as the new sports roadster based on last year's EV-STER concept study. <p/> For the US markets, the acura RLX is also confirmed for the Los Angeles show in November, and is expected to arrive in Europe later in the form of the honda legend.

We would also like to thank Sasha Kumer, Secretary General of the SDPZ, who also supported the taxi drivers' union at the meeting and gave the SDPZ's position. We would also like to thank the SAB, the Left Party, the LMŠ and the SD for their support. <p/> Despite the efforts of the union to raise the issue of changing the law in favour of Uber, unfortunately most of the cons did not want to hear it, they are all just making excuses, saying memorised sentences and avoiding real answers. <p/> With the efforts of taxi drivers and the help of the state, the quality of taxi services has improved dramatically over the last 10 years. Taxi meters have been made compulsory (annually certified and calibrated), a licence is required, a tourist examination, no criminal record, adequate financial standing - fixed assets, a roadworthiness test twice a year, special insurance for passengers, the introduction of cash registers, etc. <p/> With the current law, the State strongly regulates the taxi business and makes fraud impossible. However, by changing the law, the taxi business will be set back 30 years, so years of effort will be wiped out in a matter of months. Why? Simply because Uber has a different business model and cannot operate under our laws. <p/> The current government is silent on the fact that Uber will not pay a cent in tax on their profits. The current government is silent on the known facts of the problem of Uber drivers appearing abroad. The current government is silent on the fact that wherever Uber is present, there are major problems, read - robberies, rapes, beatings and even murders. The current government is silent on how it will protect consumers and the potential disputes and problems that will arise with the arrival of Uber, how and in what way the government will protect consumers and who consumers can turn to in order to resolve them. The current government is silent on the fact that a ride that today a consumer pays €5 for on the taximeter when Uber arrives will, according to their algorithms, also be €20 or more if demand is high at that moment. The current government is silent that the change in legislation does not do any good, not for the country, not for the taxi drivers, and least of all for the consumers. <p/> Despite the fact that we did not win the session and the change in the law was approved in the session, we will not stop, we will work for all taxi drivers and residents and their better future. We are concerned about the future and the safety of our citizens, that is why we are NOT against ""competition"", but we are against changing the law. <p/> Unlike the current government, we in the union are happy to see the cooperation and listening of local authorities. We are happy about the warm and positive reception at the MOL, we are happy that in the future in Ljubljana, in cooperation with the Mayor Mr Jankovič, we will bring the taxi business to the highest possible level, both with vehicles, drivers and prices that will be accessible to any user, regardless of the arrival of foreign platforms.",Opinion/Argumentation,test

957,"Case-law: Admissibility of a revision 05.10.2015 According to settled case-law, if the claimant does not state the value of the object at issue for each individual claim, but only states the total value, this is not sufficient for the admissibility of a revision. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the claims that the defendants were obliged to enter into a contract of sale with the plaintiffs, pursuant to which they would sell the property to them and the plaintiffs were obliged to pay the defendants the unpaid part of the purchase price. The applicants also claimed that the defendants were obliged to deliver possession of the property to them and to pay them a monthly fee until delivery. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the applicants' appeal and upheld the judgment under appeal. The applicants lodged an appeal against the final judgment, raising all the grounds of appeal and seeking an amendment of the judgment under appeal to allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of First Instance and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. <p/> The review was not allowed. The applicants brought three claims against the three defendants. The claims for the conclusion of a contract of sale and for the delivery of immovable property are non-monetary claims for which the right to review depends on the value of the subject-matter in dispute. Notwithstanding Article 41(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (CPL), the value of the contested part of a final judgment is to be determined by adding together the values of the individual claims or parts of those claims which are still in dispute, where the decision on the review depends on the resolution of legal issues common to all those claims or where the individual claims are so interrelated that the decision on one claim depends on the decision on another claim (Article 367(5) CPL). However, in the case of the first two claims (for the conclusion of the contract of sale and for the delivery of the immovable property), there is not only an objective cumulation, but also a subjective one. There are three defendants. <p/> Where a claim is brought against several defendants, it is incumbent on the plaintiff, pursuant to Article 41(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, to state the value of the object of the dispute for each defendant individually and not for all the defendants jointly. If the plaintiff fails to do so and in such a case states only one value of the subject-matter in dispute for all defendants together, this is a so-called undifferentiated value of the subject-matter in dispute. <p/> The defendants are not united co-defendants, since they are not in such a substantive community that only the same decision for all three would be possible. Since they are co-owners and can dispose of their co-ownership interest in the immovable property independently, the defendants are ordinary co-defendants within the meaning of Article 191(1)(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, and the aggregation of values under Article 41(1) in conjunction with Article 367(5) of the Civil Procedure Code is therefore not applicable in such a case. <p/> Moreover, the claimants are also ordinary co-claimants, since they claim the conclusion of the contract and delivery of possession each for themselves in accordance with their share of the joint ownership. In view of the co-partnership relationship on both sides, the Supreme Court found that there were six claims, each of which could share a separate legal fate. The admissibility of the revision would therefore be judged on the value of each individual claim. <p/> However, since the applicants did not indicate the value of the subject-matter at issue for each individual claim, but only one, aggregate value (EUR 135,000) was indicated, this is an undifferentiated indication of the value of the subject-matter at issue, which, according to settled case-law, is not sufficient for the admissibility of the revision. It is not possible to determine to which of the claimants and to which of the defendants the total value of the disputed object referred to in the application relates, so that the situation is the same as if the value of the disputed object had not been mentioned at all, which means that the revision is not admissible. Since the value of the pecuniary claim also did not exceed the threshold of EUR 40 000, the review is not admissible in that respect either. In accordance with Article 377 of the CPC, the Court of Review dismissed the unauthorised revision.",Legal/Regulation,test

Recent media reports that fires on buildings with solar power plants cannot be extinguished are incorrect. <p/> The Slovenian Fire Brigades Association (DFB) has drawn up recommendations for firefighters based on the intervention guidelines of the German Fire Brigades Association (DFB). The BISOL Group, the only domestic manufacturer of photovoltaic modules, has contributed its extensive experience and expertise to the development of these recommendations. In other parts of the world, the procedures for extinguishing fires at solar power plants are clearly defined, and BISOL has been familiar with them and has been following them from the outset. <p/> With many requests for advice from regional fire brigades coming to the BISOL Group, the Group is pleased that the Fire Brigades Association of Slovenia did, however, issue recommendations for firefighters last December and forwarded them to all the fire brigades associations across Slovenia. The recommendations clearly set out what to do in the event of a fire at a solar farm. The fire may be extinguished with water, subject to the prescribed minimum safety distance, which is 1 metre for medium-voltage energy installations extinguished with a water mist extinguisher and 5 metres for water jet extinguishing. Fire flames can also be stopped with a dust extinguisher, a CO2 extinguisher, and a foam extinguisher can only be used to extinguish non-energised appliances. <p/> As of 1 January, the amended Fire Regulations also finally came into force, requiring a fire plan to be drawn up for buildings equipped with a solar power plant connected to the public electricity grid. The fire plan must be displayed in a conspicuous place and brought to the attention of the regional fire brigade. All solar power plants of the BISOL Group shall be installed in accordance with the applicable regulations. <p/> In view of the success of photovoltaics on the global market, the BISOL Group firmly believes in the long-term viability of generating electricity from solar energy and looks forward to cooperating with the Slovenian Fire Brigades Association in the future.",Other,test

They are powered by Linux. <p/> The Top500, a website dedicated to keeping track of what's happening in supercomputing, has published its 53rd updated list of the world's most powerful computers. There are no changes to the top spots, with IBM's Summit and Sierra still at the top, followed by China's Sunway TaihuLight and Tianhe-2A, and Dell's Frontera in fifth place. Europe is represented in the top ten list with Switzerland's Piz Daint at number six and Germany's SuperMUC-NG, while France's Pangea III narrowly missed the top ten. <p/> All these supercomputers differ in terms of core count, floating point speed, power consumption and more, but they have one thing in common - they are all powered by Linux. <p/> Since Microsoft has taken away their right to use academic licences, the European Organization for Nuclear Research has decided to switch to open source solutions. <p/> For more than twenty years, CERN in Switzerland, or the European Organization for Nuclear Research as we call it, has been using Microsoft products under the licences that apply to academic institutions. These licences have to be renewed from time to time, and in March this year, when they wanted them again, Microsoft told them that such a licence was no longer valid for them and sent them the usual commercial contract, which more than doubled the price of the licences. CERN officials disagreed and revived the idea of switching to open source solutions. And the Microsoft Alternatives Project, or MAlt for short, was born. And what is the project all about? In their blog, they write that the aim of the project is to ""regain control of our own data"", and that it will start with the migration of mail services and Skype to open source alternatives, and if all goes to plan, all other services will follow. <p/> Microsoft must of course have reacted to the decision, because CERN is an extremely prestigious institution and therefore a nice reference. It offered a ten-year transition period during which the price of the licences would gradually increase, but the people in charge at CERN rejected the offer, saying that such costs were simply not sustainable. <p/> If the project is successful, the decision will certainly have wider implications. CERN is not the only institution of its kind to face what is known as vendor lock-in, or dependence on a single supplier. If they can show that essential services can be delivered without Microsoft and other providers of licensed software over which the user has no control, other similar institutions may decide to take a similar step.",Opinionated News,test

987,"info@dc-dlan.si <p/> 0590 80 616 <p/> CONTACT US <p/> What does gender theory teach? <p/> Gender theory is the latest ideology to emerge from the social sciences. <p/> At its core, it denies the existence of two natural identities (male identity and female identity), denies the differences between them and denies the natural attraction between male and female. (Proponents of gender theory argue that heterosexuality is a ""compulsion"" of society that dictates that sexual relations must be between two different sexes and, consequently, procreative). <p/> Gender theory primarily teaches that a person's gender is not determined by his or her genitals, but that the individual decides for him or herself what gender he or she will be. Thus, the ""true sex"" is only that which the individual feels in his or her mind. This realisation has given rise to a wide range of genders that is difficult to match. Not only can an individual change his or her gender, but he or she can also switch between them, invent a new gender or decide to be genderless or asexual. <p/> At the same time, gender theory does not recognise that the relationship between man and woman is unique. It claims that all sexual orientations and practices are the same. Thus, there is no difference between heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, asexuality or any other sexual experience or experience. <p/> Why is gender theory an ideology? Gender theory is not a scientific theory because it is completely divorced from the natural sciences. It also does not have a single author, but has been developed piecemeal over more than 60 years. It began to develop in the 1950s (through the Marxist feminist Simone de Beavuor) and then in the 1970s in the USA through the Women's Revolution, which coincided with the sexual revolution. In the 1990s it was radicalised by the feminist Judith Butler (and her followers), who still argues that gender identity is an illusion. According to her, even biological bodies are not a natural given, but shaped by culture, by society. <p/> Why did it all start with feminists? They were convinced that talking about masculinity and femininity and their differences leads to even more stereotypical thinking and to a deepening of masculine and feminine gender schemas, the result of which is the perpetuation of women's subordinate social position. <p/> Gender theory reached its global peak in 1995, when the UN adopted the new term 'gender' at the World Conference on Women in Beijing, thereby signaling that gender would no longer be spoken of as a stable natural given (biological sex) but as a merely unstable and fluid category (social sex) that has no pre-given essence or meaning. Today, gender identity is seen only as a deep inner sense of belonging to a gender that may or may not correspond to one's innate sex. <p/> This policy was launched by the UN 20 years ago and has infiltrated every pore of society: politics, the judiciary, the media, philanthropic and humanitarian organisations, schools and universities, music, art, film and literature. <p/> The various LGBT lobbies and influential NGOs in the main European institutions (ILGA at the European Commission and others) have played a major role in this revolution. <p/> When did the ideology start? <p/> Robert Stoller (1925-1992) of the University of California, Los Angeles, was the first to divide sexual identity into biological sex (sex) and social sex (gender). Humans are therefore defined by two dimensions: biology (chromosomes, hormones, external and internal sex organs, secondary sex characteristics) and the social-psychological expression of gender (sex roles, behaviour, actions, traits). <p/> The distinction between biological and social sex is not in itself false. It becomes ideological when social gender is assigned a dominant role in determining gender identity. <p/> Gender ideology began when theorists isolated biological sex from social sex. This separation made the two categories completely unrelated, without the influence of one on the other. <p/> The truth is that biological and social sex are interdependent, complementary and intimately linked within the developmental process. We cannot imagine a body that does not have a direct influence on the development of psychological sex and that is not reflected in concrete ways in society. From this point of view, social gender is not, under any circumstances, simply determined by society or ""taught"" from the outside. <p/> Science in the 1950s and gender theory <p/> Dr Money, who was a psychologist and sexologist, was developing a new theory of gender around 1970. His idea was based on the premise that a newborn baby is born psychosexually neutral and that by the age of three, it can be assigned either a male or a female sex. So, it is only parents and society that mould children into men and women. The biological component of sex - chromosomes, gonads, hormones, external and internal sex organs - is merely a kind of ""plastic"" that can be either overlooked (chromosomes) or altered at will. <p/> Dr Money, who was head of the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic, and his colleagues did not see the human being as a whole, whose psyche and physicality develop mutually, from conception onwards. The inextricable link between endocrinology and brain development and their influence on the development of the individual's psyche and behaviour was not a topic they wanted to explore. He preferred to calculate human components in his own way, believing that the psyche would adapt to newly imposed chemical and surgical changes if only education was persistent enough. <p/> A sad combination of circumstances brought a boy of less than two years of age to Moneye's practice, who at eight months was left without a sex organ after an accident. Dr Money, through prior indoctrination of his parents, had raised him as a girl. What has become apparent over the years has had a catastrophic effect on the psychosocial development of this boy and on his entire family. But since no one but the immediate family saw this, Dr Money used this case in books and professional articles as a successful example of the proof that biology is changeable and that nurture plays a key role in the formation of sexual identity. <p/> The growing women's movement in the USA, which had been fighting for decades against the biological basis of gender differences, saw in Money's theory a scientific explanation that the differences between men and women were the result of social expectations that had been shaped by a patriarchal pattern. <p/> Moneyev's theory and the feminist movement have virtually merged into one: man and woman are basically identical, having been born ""neutral"". All the visible differences between them (their gait, posture, tastes, interests, hobbies, the way they dress, speak, feel, relate; children's choice of games and toys, adults' choice of occupation, their roles in society and the family, etc.) are merely a matter of habituation, which can be overcome by a persistent revolutionary movement and through re-education. <p/> That Moneyev's theory does not hold water and that the Decalogue has been falsely presented as scientific was exposed in 1995 by Dr Milton Diamond. Investigative journalist, David Colapinto, wrote a high-profile article on the case in Rolling Stone magazine in 1997 and the world-famous bestseller Bruce, Brenda, David in 2000. The boy who was raised as a girl. <p/>What do scientists say today? <p/> Johns Hopkins Hospital, famous in the 1970s for its state-of-the-art sex theory, took a different course after Moneye's gradual withdrawal. After the arrival of Dr McHugh, an advocate of bringing sanity back into the profession, the Gender Identity Clinic, which had been surgically altering the sex of adult human beings, was closed down as early as 1979. <p/> Last August 2016, Dr McHugh, in collaboration with Dr Mayer, published the largest study in the field of sexuality and gender identity in the scientific journal The New Atlantis. Together, they worked on over 500 studies published from 1950 to the present day. They have taken a hard look at all the factors that have a major impact on the development of a person's sexual orientation and gender identity. They have paid a great deal of attention to mental health and the real difficulties experienced by non-heterosexual people and people who have problems with their sexual identity. <p/> With regard to sexual identity, they simply confirmed the fact that it cannot be independent of biological sex. Among all the studies examined, they found no scientific evidence to confirm that there is a physiological cause that determines a person's feeling of having been born in the wrong body. <p/> Furthermore, they found that adults who have undergone sex reassignment surgery continue to suffer from poor mental health. The scientists also found that so-called social stressors (discrimination, prejudice, stigmatisation) were not the main source of suffering, leading these people to experience fear, anxiety, isolation, alcoholism, drug abuse and suicidality (41%). Above all, they found that these are the ills that stem to the greatest extent from the person himself, from the conflict that he carries within himself. <p/> They also looked critically at attempts at sex reassignment in children. They have observed that a very small number of children who are overwhelmed by the feeling of being trapped in the wrong body when they are growing up will continue to have this opinion of themselves after they have grown up. For this reason, there is no evidence that children who exhibit atypical behaviour during puberty should be encouraged to undergo hormonal and surgical sex reassignment. <p/> Poor psychological health continues to be associated with people who suffer from discomfort in accepting their own bodies, and both doctors are working hard to help these patients in the best possible way. <p/> Gender theory in the school system <p/> Gender theory is already part of the regular curriculum in many countries. In Slovenia, the advocates of gender theory have also ensured that for more than a decade now, Slovenian public schools have also offered programmes called ""against homophobia"", ""against stereotypes"", ""against discrimination"", ""for inclusion of all"", ""for human rights"", etc. They are carried out in our country by various associations such as Amnesty International, the DiH Association, the Peace Institute, Legebitra, the TransAkcija Association, etc. <p/> Through debates, brochures, magazines and games, children are taught that there are several genders, that everyone has the right to determine their own gender and to experiment with their sexual orientation. <p/> Example: a few years ago, Amnesty International published the book Love is Love and disseminated its content in Slovenian primary and secondary schools. I quote a few sentences from the book, which show that it denigrates the traditional family, the role of dad and mum in bringing up children, promotes homosexuality and creates a great deal of confusion about sexual identity. <p/> ""Is the father figure always male?"" (p. 20) <p/> ""Is the mother figure something that is essentially tied to the female gender?"" (p.20) <p/> ""Let us remember that gender is something that we must have the right and the possibility to create ourselves and not according to the dictates of our genitals, which should force a person to be a woman or to be a man!"" (p.26) <p/> ""Being lesbian or gay, bisexual or transgender, intersex is normal and totally cool."" (p.39) <p/> Primary school children read books like ""My name is Damjan"" (about a girl who wants to be a boy), ""And with Tango there are three of us"" (about two penguins who get a daughter named Tango), etc. <p/> Changing the language of legislation <p/> ""Change the words and you will change the way society thinks"", wrote Lenin. Language became the main tool for achieving cultural change. Words like 'family', 'marriage', 'love', 'sex' take on a new, different, polysemous meaning; the words 'natural', 'normal', 'perverse' are removed. In certain countries (e.g. Switzerland, the canton of Bern), words with a more neutral sound have been introduced. <p/> The words ""father and mother"" and ""husband and wife"" are the most affected. They are taking away gender from these terms because they are convinced that society must not produce the herosexual family as the only example of a family. They therefore prefer to choose neutral terms where no one will be discriminated against and where all the symbolism of natural family ties will be erased and consequently irrelevant. <p/> Instead of ""father and mother"": <p/> ""parent 1"" and ""parent 2"" (Spain) <p/> ""genetic donor"" (Quebec Civil Code) <p/> Instead of ""husband and wife"" <p/> ""person 1"" and ""person 2"" (proposal for Slovenia, 2015)",Opinion/Argumentation,test
